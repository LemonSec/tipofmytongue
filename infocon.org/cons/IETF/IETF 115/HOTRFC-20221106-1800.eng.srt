168
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,160

172
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,519

173
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680

174
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,720
one thing that I never mentioned next

175
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,220
slide

176
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,740
is that the original use case that

177
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,860
motivated all of this was end-to-end

178
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,959
Secure social media

179
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,480
I wanted to have something like Facebook

180
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,140
or Twitter except that I wanted all my

181
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,740
content to be encrypted so that whoever

182
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,920
was hosting that Service couldn't read

183
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,120
it

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,839
by end-to-end secure I mean the

185
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,019
the administrator of the website cannot

186
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,320
read the content end to end in my view

187
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,399
is from my eyeballs to whoever wrote

188
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,360
so it was always in the plan and so I

189
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,920
pulled out that next slide please

190
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,760
and so yeah I've got a draft out there

191
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,680
uh describes how to use the mesh to

192
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,980
build a complete Communications

193
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,160
infrastructure and actually there isn't

194
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,820
there very much extra work to do social

195
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,220
media on top of

196
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,560
synchronous messaging

197
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,019
asynchronous isn't that much of a big

198
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,760
deal uh video just use webrtc

199
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,560
that's already done all the heavy

200
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,779
lifting to do that part of the

201
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,839
communication next slide

202
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,839
so so what do I mean by an open social

203
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,300
media what I mean is I own my account

204
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,620
I control it and I can change take it

205
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,560
from one service provider to another

206
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,440
without switching costs without losing

207
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,260
all my followers without losing all that

208
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,019
context that I've invested that belongs

209
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,200
to me not my publisher

210
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,839
and I want you to be able to choose

211
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,480
curators who are choosing content for

212
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,740
them not have somebody with an algorithm

213
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,660
designed to make me engage by filling my

214
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,639
feed with fascism

215
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
I want a social media that isn't a

216
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,700
single person's point of view and

217
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,320
especially not when that single person

218
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,839
can't think of a more interesting place

219
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,079
to go and VR than his office

220
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,180
I want a Multiverse

221
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,920
so next slide

222
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,100
so I'm building this stuff uh and of

223
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,480
course what people will be saying is

224
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,000
Well isn't Mastodon doing something like

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,880
that well yes it is but they're not

226
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,160
using cryptography

227
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,880
not yet at any rate if I can take my

228
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,639
stuff and add it to the federal verse so

229
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
it becomes the encrypted part of

230
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,019
fediverse that's great to me we've got

231
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,880
all that encrypted stuff in the black

232
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,220
Network and there's also the red Network

233
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
you can visit for the things that don't

234
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,399
need to be uh private next slide so the

235
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,000
big question here is what do we call it

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,579
and I think I've already got the name

237
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,720
you know everything

238
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,180
and you know it might be the co Catalyst

239
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,480
to building the everything so if you're

240
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,139
interested in building a social media

241
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,699
that is for the people

242
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,639
and not for the billionaires uh please

243
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,220
come and talk to me I've got a draft out

244
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,560
there uh everything

245
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
and that shows how

246
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,320
you don't need a lot of mechanism to

247
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,540
build something that is useful and

248
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,800
matters

249
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,059
[Applause]

250
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,500
next up after Roland is um

251
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,720
is Jeffrey

252
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,420
yeah hi my name is Roland and I'd like

253
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,600
to introduce Kira which is a scalable ID

254
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,579
based routing architecture special

255
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,740
specially designed for control planes

256
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,440
and for control planes connectivity is

257
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,839
really important so the first goal is to

258
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,420
uphold the connectivity while the second

259
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,040
goal is to be also route efficient

260
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,420
and we want to provide a highly

261
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,720
resilient control plane

262
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,480
scalability was one objective

263
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,000
and here we targeted at hundred

264
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,579
thousands of nodes which could be

265
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,920
present at a single domain

266
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,100
um we route on node IDs so there's no

267
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,459
natively in that sense uh so we have no

268
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,519
idea to locator mapping for example and

269
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,320
the scalability is achieved by having

270
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
very small routing tables which scale

271
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,020
algorithmically with a number of nodes

272
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,740
um

273
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,980
and every node ID has an Associated path

274
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,299
Vector which stores the route

275
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,740
the routes in the routing table actually

276
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,459
are shortest path routes

277
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,679
and one specialty of the solution is

278
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,400
that we have a selectable memory stretch

279
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,500
trade-off per node

280
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,740
uh the whole solution is uh designed to

281
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,840
be zero touch so no configuration is

282
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,760
required so also no configuration

283
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,299
mistake can take your control plane down

284
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,460
um it also works well on various

285
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,679
topologies out of the box so no special

286
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,380
versions for data center topologies

287
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,480
which are denser than other sparse or

288
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
topologies and so on required which we

289
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,940
call topological versatility it is Loop

290
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,520
free even during convergence it uses

291
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
path IDs as labels and it's forwarding

292
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,679
tier in some kind of label switching and

293
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,480
so out of the box it provides zero com

294
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,799
IPv6 connectivity next slide please

295
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,980
so uh what else did we do uh we created

296
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,320
also a special end system modes because

297
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,600
end systems don't route so they don't

298
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,240
need routing updates and so on so we can

299
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,400
reduce the overhead

300
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,679
um it also supports multi-path routing

301
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,980
and forwarding it has a built-in DHT

302
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,980
which is a key value store on a

303
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,260
distributed Manner and also name or

304
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,240
service lookups can be done with the

305
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,460
help of the DHT or resource Discovery

306
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,039
and recently we also proposed a topology

307
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
very efficient and scalable topology

308
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,140
Discovery scheme based on that key

309
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,299
resolution so Kira provides highly

310
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,280
scalable resilient Euro control plane

311
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,440
connectivity and we think that is

312
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,179
important for future networks because

313
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,700
they are getting more complex so if you

314
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,940
want to know more there's no draft out

315
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,360
yet we've tried or we want to get

316
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,880
feedback on whether people find this

317
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,240
interesting to standardize we think yes

318
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
but we want to hear your feedback so

319
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,860
there's a link to the paper and I have

320
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,320
two presentation schedules at this ITF

321
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,660
meeting one um in the routing area

322
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,059
working group meeting on Thursday and

323
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,340
also in the anima working group which is

324
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,340
related to the autonomous control plates

325
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,100
thanks

326
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,330
[Applause]

327
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,000
so we have

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,500
Jeffrey come here

329
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,260
and next step after that is Rolf

330
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,980
right

331
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,360
yeah the next one

332
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,980
oh so uh if I a mobile user print uh

333
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,340
is responsible for the data traffic

334
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,100
between the user equipment or your

335
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,000
iPhone

336
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,980
and Data Network

337
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,600
it includes

338
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,959
oh

339
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,700
this is supposed to be uh

340
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,820
um

341
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,559
animation but I guess it okay anyway

342
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,340
um

343
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,380
so

344
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,200
you have those uh

345
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,039
ran elements

346
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:31,260
r-u-d-u-c-u and then you have uh those

347
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,440
are the for the uh Wireless part and

348
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,539
then you have the UPF it's like a router

349
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,919
or a broad Broadband can Network Gateway

350
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,660
and the UPF is connected to a Data

351
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,860
Network

352
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,360
with

353
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,020
UPF being distributed nowadays for Edge

354
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,460
Computing purposes now the UPF

355
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,380
and then it also means that data

356
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,960
networks are also being distributed and

357
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,419
that means they are implemented as a VPN

358
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:08,220
so you have the p is there and so the

359
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,220
CEUs are the genobi centralized units

360
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,299
now the CU UPF and P is they are all

361
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,299
co-located at the same Edge data center

362
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,960
still they are separate entities

363
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,240
so the between the CEO and UPF you have

364
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,299
the user traffic encapsulated into the

365
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,539
in the gtpu tunnel even if

366
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,700
the UPF and CEO are running on the same

367
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,720
server

368
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,240
so the idea is uh

369
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,419
what we combine those CU UPF and PE

370
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,700
function into a single entity which we

371
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,380
call the end up here

372
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,880
now you basically have a router

373
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,640
with wireless

374
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,020
interfaces and

375
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,720
wired connector interfaces

376
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,140
and has the vpnp functionality

377
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,100
next slide please

378
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,140
so this model

379
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,720
of a router or switch with wireless and

380
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,679
wired connections

381
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,100
now the wireless Technologies is only

382
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,559
responsible for the wireless access just

383
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,900
like that triple E technology for

384
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,940
ethernet connection for a router and

385
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,620
after that everything else is ietf IEEE

386
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,600
while and Technologies with the routing

387
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,659
and switching and all the features VPN

388
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,360
EVP and whatever they're already in the

389
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,400
Wildland world can be applied to the

390
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,580
wireless as well as as well no changes

391
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,460
next slide

392
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,100
the advantage of this is that we no

393
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,500
longer required as a tunnel so it can

394
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,900
simplified signaling optimized data

395
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
plane

396
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,600
and

397
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
because we now have a unified

398
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,260
architecture

399
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,640
many special 5G features procedures

400
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,340
Dino are no longer needed you basically

401
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,200
have a router and switch with wireless

402
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,520
and wired connections

403
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,620
so this seems to be a natural evolution

404
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,780
to People Like Us who are familiar with

405
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,539
iitf Wildland Technologies but it's a

406
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,940
big paradigm shift on 3gp side

407
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,760
and the work would have to be done in

408
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,360
3gpp and not in IHF but what we have

409
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,880
been trying to do here in ITF is to talk

410
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,100
to people especially the mobile

411
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,780
operators

412
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,900
to talk to their attack Architects to

413
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,539
get their support first Jeffrey you're

414
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:40,740
getting real close

415
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,220
okay if they if we get that support then

416
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,500
we can bring this to 3gpp for further

417
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,760
discussion

418
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,400
that's it

419
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,620
[Applause]

420
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,219
thank you

421
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,020
I'm Spencer can you hear me

422
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,700
expensive you hear me

423
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,640
that is correct can you hear me

424
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,520
yes yes very well

425
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,059
all right

426
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:19,460
yeah

427
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,380
all right my name is Raul and I've been

428
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,820
doing this work together with Valentin

429
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,559
where he did most of the heavy lifting

430
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,900
and together we want to supercharge

431
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,400
trace route and I'm going to take the

432
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,260
next three and a half minutes to explain

433
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,780
to you what we mean by that

434
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,480
so today when you want to assess the

435
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,860
state of the network or when something

436
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,419
goes wrong and you want to figure out

437
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,820
what is going wrong then the ITF has

438
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,460
defined quite an extensive set of OEM

439
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,400
mechanisms that help you with this so

440
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,260
for example we have young netconf and

441
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,780
rest conf and that lets you well of

442
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,159
course configure

443
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,900
um your boxes but it also lets you

444
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,299
monitor everything related to your boxes

445
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,340
but it's boxes that are under your

446
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,020
control obviously

447
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,659
and in addition and more recently we

448
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,960
have things like in c2oim or ioim and

449
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,380
there you add data or information to

450
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,059
your data packets and that lets you

451
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,799
measure everything that is related to

452
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,320
your segment of a path so that segment

453
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,659
of a path that is under your control

454
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,360
and with a bunch of other things like

455
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,400
ipfix to export flow level information

456
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,039
from a router we have a bunch of

457
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,900
mechanisms that have been defined by the

458
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,419
ietf but they all have in common that

459
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,520
you have to be on in control of those

460
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,220
boxes you have to be operating those

461
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,240
boxes

462
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,740
and the question is what about the

463
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,960
public internet so the places on the

464
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,580
internet that you are not in control of

465
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,340
and there you basically have two tools

466
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,039
available one is Ping and ping gives you

467
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,020
very little information so you have

468
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,120
interface reachability you know that

469
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,679
interface is reachable and it gives you

470
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,320
a round trip time estimation with it but

471
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,760
that's all the information ping gives

472
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,440
you and then on the other hand you have

473
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,059
trace route and trace route is more

474
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,760
expressive it gives you router level

475
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,799
information so it basically lists or

476
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,600
enumerates all the routers from you

477
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,640
towards the destination on the public

478
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,500
internet and it gives you round trip

479
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,480
time estimations for every hop and the

480
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,700
final destination and what we would like

481
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,919
to do is we would like to make trace

482
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,900
route better in the sense that we also

483
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,659
want to estimate the reverse path

484
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,360
because today's internet is highly

485
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,820
asymmetric that means the forward path

486
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,460
and the the return path are typically

487
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,320
not the same and we would like to

488
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,960
basically illuminate this this reverse

489
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,179
path using a better trace route next

490
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,539
right

491
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:41,580
so we have published an internet draft

492
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,279
in area and in The Orange Box you see

493
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,640
the link towards that draft and we would

494
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,140
like you to to actually read the

495
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,659
document and then join the discussion in

496
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,460
in the area

497
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,860
we also have implemented we like running

498
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,779
code obviously so we have implemented

499
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,360
reverse trace route and we would like

500
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,820
you if you could

501
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,779
um

502
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,539
host a reverse trace route endpoint it's

503
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,760
a ebpf a small ebpf program that you can

504
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,760
run on any Linux box and it would offer

505
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,640
reverse trace route to clients so if you

506
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,620
don't want to do that you could also

507
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,240
help by running the client and send us

508
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,919
the output because we would like to

509
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,080
assess how good this implementation is

510
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,640
what the properties of the

511
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,200
implementation are what we see on the

512
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,659
public internet so running the tool

513
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,460
would be very helpful to us

514
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,559
and remember the internet is for the end

515
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,140
user that's at least what RFC 8890 says

516
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,179
and shows this works so this is for

517
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,600
people and organizations that

518
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,799
um don't necessarily run the

519
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,179
infrastructure but they have something

520
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,520
that is running in the cloud and they

521
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,460
would like to measure um path quality

522
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,100
from their point of the network

523
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,840
um to another Point um over the public

524
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,940
internet or for organizations that

525
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,500
consume Services of the public internet

526
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,260
so for everybody that is not running

527
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,480
um the internet or running parts of the

528
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,200
internet

529
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,059
so there's a website you can look at

530
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,500
there's clearly the draft you can look

531
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,779
at the GitHub if you go there it's empty

532
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,580
at this point in time we're still fixing

533
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,860
a couple of things and and cleaning up

534
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,020
the code but in a couple of days we are

535
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,760
hopeful that it's going to be um there

536
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,440
but

537
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,539
um if you would like to help us run

538
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:21,179
reverse trace route please send me an

539
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,299
email

540
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,240
thank you

541
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,179
I'm looking for uh Andrew Camlin

542
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,700
Andrew kampling are you with us

543
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,080
ah yes excellent

544
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,179
about ready yep let's do it

545
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,400
all right good evening everyone

546
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,120
um

547
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,520
I'm here today to talk to you about the

548
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,760
uh encrypted client hello

549
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,140
um and specifically deployment

550
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,020
considerations uh associated with uh uh

551
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,200
encrypted client ho or ech there's a

552
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,580
number of us that have been working on a

553
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,460
draft uh covering this topic

554
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,880
um uh Arno uh tadai from broadcom should

555
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,039
be around later on this evening his

556
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,380
flight hasn't landed yet so anyone's

557
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,299
interested uh either speak to me or

558
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,460
speak to her though through this week

559
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,399
slide please

560
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,179
a very brief bit of context ech is a

561
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,360
mechanism in the TLs protocol that's

562
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,480
been added to encrypt the client Hello

563
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
message

564
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,760
um which has previously been uh in plain

565
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,320
text

566
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,360
um it builds on the previous encrypted

567
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,620
Sni proposal it is like a superset of

568
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,279
that within the TLs working group and if

569
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,620
you're interested uh to see more detail

570
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,399
about ech I've put a link to the uh the

571
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,559
relevant draft which when I last checked

572
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,659
was at draft 15

573
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,000
um it is being continuously updated next

574
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,100
libraries

575
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,399
uh the reason we're interested uh in

576
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,899
this topic

577
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,840
um is uh by encrypting that sort of

578
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,940
plain text Data um that does have

579
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,480
implications for end users uh

580
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,600
um and we're keen to uh make sure that's

581
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,620
understood so uh RC 7258 uh sort of

582
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,360
recognizes that making networks

583
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,220
unmanageable

584
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,860
um is not an acceptable outcome

585
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,720
um

586
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,380
RFC uh 8404 looks at uh security network

587
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,200
operations and their practices that

588
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,720
could be impacted by the move to uh

589
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,600
end-to-end encryption

590
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,720
um and uh

591
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,580
it's I think perhaps not widely

592
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,220
understood that the Sni data is widely

593
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,279
used by on path uh security actors so it

594
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,620
does have quite significant implications

595
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,179
for a number of different uh sort of uh

596
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,100
groups of users particularly so

597
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,960
Enterprise and consumer next slide

598
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,140
please

599
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,940
um

600
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,740
rc8744 which looks at the need for

601
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,899
encrypting uh Sni

602
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,299
um and now if you didn't really uh

603
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,299
consider insufficient depth of the

604
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,679
implications

605
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,659
um I won't go through the detail on the

606
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,120
slide in the interest of time what we're

607
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,899
aiming to do as a group is to fix that

608
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:39,860
and actually write a draft which covers

609
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,240
insufficient detail what the

610
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,059
implications are for end users and what

611
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,520
actions they may need to take next slide

612
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,200
please

613
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,360
so with that in mind if that's of

614
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,179
interest to you for in any reason uh

615
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,980
we'll be uploading a draft

616
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,960
um hopefully as soon as tomorrow uh when

617
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,720
data tracker reopens which will have uh

618
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,659
the latest sort of uh thinking uh it's

619
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,640
by no means complete yet we're certainly

620
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,840
looking for people to add to uh the text

621
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,640
so if this subjects of interest to you

622
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,440
please look at the draft and more

623
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,580
importantly we have a side meeting

624
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,940
tomorrow evening at uh 7 P.M local time

625
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,760
uh in Richmond six so again if this is

626
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,260
of interest to you please come along to

627
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,960
that uh if you're attending the session

628
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,440
remotely uh you can join us via Zoom

629
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,260
um the links on the screen and also in

630
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,140
the side meeting

631
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,700
agenda so

632
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,980
um please come along and uh contribute

633
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,779
to the discussion and that's it thank

634
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,830
you

635
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,039
[Applause]

636
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,880
so we've got uh Daniel petryapp and John

637
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,779
border after him

638
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,500
and I'm actually I'm actually running a

639
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,240
timer here that

640
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,059
um you can look with the you can look

641
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,919
with the uh

642
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,899
one of the changes color all right

643
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:11,159
sounds good

644
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,100
by the way I I'm Thomas I'm not nearly

645
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,659
as nice as Dan

646
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,880
so I'll be clear about that

647
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,500
and but we're here to tell you about

648
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,740
vcons next slide please

649
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,059
so

650
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,100
um in my day job I'm the CTO of a

651
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,299
company that talks to a lot of people

652
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:31,440
about a million every year and um I'm

653
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
charged with taking care of their data

654
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,760
as if it were my company's data but I

655
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,539
can't

656
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,279
and so I'm here today to talk about

657
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,899
vcons

658
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,720
um and I want to talk about uh why this

659
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,860
is important because this is the

660
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,299
intersection between two really

661
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,700
important things customer data privacy

662
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,860
and machine learning and artificial

663
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,039
intelligence and it's my job as a CTO of

664
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,019
my little company to make sure that we

665
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,880
honor our customers and return to our

666
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,399
shareholders abcon is a construction

667
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,440
that allows me to understand what's

668
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,140
exactly inside a conversation so I can

669
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,600
use it appropriately I can share it

670
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,639
appropriately I know what I shared and

671
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,918
when a customer asks me could you please

672
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,739
delete my data I can because I know what

673
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,239
data I have

674
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,020
next please

675
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,540
so the vcon has four parts to it the

676
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,619
first part is obvious it's the

677
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,480
conversation it's the video it's the

678
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,520
audio it's the chat transcript maybe

679
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,260
it's a lot of those as a person has gone

680
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,060
through a channel that's the obvious

681
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,679
part the second part though is the

682
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,359
parties who actually had the

683
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,399
conversation identified as much as you

684
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,719
possibly can

685
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,399
we're living in a world where two things

686
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,859
are important anonymity and identity

687
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,960
sometimes it's really important to know

688
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,119
who said it and sometimes it's important

689
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,399
not to know who said it

690
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,619
the two lost parts of a v con are the

691
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,540
analysis what does it mean what are the

692
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,639
semantics around it what are the things

693
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,460
that let me know that oh this is full of

694
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,099
profanity or this is about a Ford Camaro

695
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,380
or the customer was angry or my agent

696
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,240
was rude

697
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,920
that's part of the conversation as is

698
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,080
the context the attachments the last

699
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,540
part what are we talking about in my

700
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,280
company it would be the lead

701
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,839
and your company might be the PowerPoint

702
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,520
presentation next

703
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,500
so this really solves a lot of practical

704
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,240
problems but the most but the most

705
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,500
important one is the responsibility

706
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,760
problem

707
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,820
that I'm being asked to have

708
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,560
responsibility for data and I don't know

709
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,760
what it is

710
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,420
and more than that if we standardize the

711
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,339
format of what a conversation looks like

712
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,500
then we can ask questions like why

713
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,859
didn't you authenticate that

714
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,780
you can ask questions we can interrogate

715
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,859
it because there's facts to be

716
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,060
interrogated

717
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,940
and then I think this is the iitf's job

718
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,700
uh this act this vcon idea came out of a

719
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,839
different group

720
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,700
we represent you know a couple dozen

721
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,780
people who think this is a great idea

722
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,660
and the programmable communication space

723
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,180
but the issue is that we live in a very

724
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,400
siled world my little company has five

725
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,200
communication systems

726
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,400
five and you know I I understand that

727
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,900
there are very large vendors who want to

728
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,000
do it all for you but I can't think of a

729
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,740
single one who is doing it all for a

730
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,599
single company because the biggest voice

731
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,339
company doesn't do chat

732
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,859
doesn't do video chat

733
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:23,400
so I can't my data engineering of

734
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,339
conversations is really limited because

735
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,380
I don't have a standard by which I can

736
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,079
interchange data validate it

737
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,440
anything next please

738
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,940
so for more information we have a

739
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,280
mailing list we just put in the draft

740
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,140
um but maybe a great place to start is

741
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,240
the white paper that was

742
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,520
um written by a half a dozen people from

743
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,140
the communications industry to tell you

744
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,480
how important this problem is to solve

745
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,040
um this is an open source project this

746
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,140
is an open source idea we are not

747
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,119
looking uh to we're looking to solve

748
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,160
this for every person and I think you as

749
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,740
people should be interested in this

750
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,380
um and so uh we we're here right now we

751
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,700
have a dispatch meeting tomorrow at 9

752
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,400
30. if you're interested in in privacy

753
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,140
if you're interested in machine learning

754
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,720
please be there and please support us

755
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,839
um and then listen uh if if you're on a

756
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,640
Thursday night I'm gonna need a drink

757
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,140
another need someone to have a drink

758
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,240
with me and we're having a birds of a

759
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
feather session at the very same time so

760
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,820
if I were you I'd come board thank you

761
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,060
very much

762
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,259
[Applause]

763
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,780
so we've got uh John and then we've got

764
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,339
uh Ken McMillan uh after John

765
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:44,240
and

766
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,119
resetting and starting okay

767
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,859
um I'm here to advertise a side meeting

768
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,240
for the encrypted transport over

769
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,380
satellite

770
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,260
um group it's it's an um non-worker

771
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,220
group mailing list next please

772
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,140
um basically we started it to talk about

773
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,300
the transport protocol being encrypted

774
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,560
in particular came out with quick

775
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,140
because on geosatellites is traditional

776
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,900
use performance enhancing proxies which

777
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,880
operates the transport layer you can't

778
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,020
do that with quick that's where we

779
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,760
started the discussion

780
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,740
um we've actually expanded since then um

781
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,140
to talk about Leo topics with related to

782
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,880
routing and all kinds of stuff so that

783
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,740
it's basically now more of a sort of a

784
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,759
general satellite list

785
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,079
the mailing list is up there and you can

786
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,900
subscribe to that link next page

787
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,839
so this is the agenda for or we have a

788
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,480
set of presentations at the side meeting

789
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,760
um you know a couple some topics about

790
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,000
high bdp networks I think mostly focus

791
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,220
on TCP but I'm not sure

792
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,599
um then we have a quick nfpc

793
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,520
presentation

794
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
um then they're reducing acknowledgments

795
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,400
um in iitf quick presentation and then

796
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,740
we just added a bbr

797
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,520
um for quick over Geo presentations so

798
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,320
the focus as you can see on this

799
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,220
particular intercept meaning is Geo

800
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,339
um so the meetings Wednesday at 11 45 in

801
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,560
Richmond six we'd like to see you there

802
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
but we also have remote participation

803
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,980
set up and again if you need more

804
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,720
information you can email me or email

805
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,339
the other set list

806
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,630
that's it

807
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:25,560
[Applause]

808
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,359
excellent

809
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,579
um so we've got Ken

810
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,700
um

811
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,740
okay thank you and I'm going to be

812
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,119
talking about some some stuff that's

813
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,880
giant work with Leno artzook uh so what

814
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,099
I like to do in this short talk is make

815
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,980
a case that formal specifications can be

816
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,160
can provide benefits in the ietf process

817
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,020
next slide please

818
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,540
so bioformal specification what I mean

819
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,760
is just some unambiguous mathematical

820
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,700
description of a system usually

821
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,640
described at some interface and that can

822
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,099
be either represented in logic or it

823
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,420
might be represented in some more

824
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,400
familiar form like an abstract

825
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,280
programming language so there's an

826
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,960
obvious benefit to writing

827
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,119
specifications in that way which is we

828
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,300
have then unambiguous documentation that

829
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,180
can be used by both implementers you

830
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,520
know and users who are building on top

831
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,000
of a given interface so that

832
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,200
specification acts as an interface

833
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,440
contract but a less obvious benefit is

834
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,000
that we can do much more rigorous

835
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,320
testing when we have formal

836
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,480
specifications not only can we do

837
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,760
runtime monitoring to make sure that

838
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,160
we're conforming to the spec but we can

839
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,260
for example automatically generate more

840
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,660
rigorous unit tests for the different

841
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,420
roles in our protocol in a way that can

842
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,220
expose errors that we don't see

843
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,040
otherwise and of course find finally we

844
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,720
can do formal proof with a formal

845
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,240
specification and that is a use and it's

846
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,460
often very useful to think of high-level

847
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,380
properties that we want to prove but we

848
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,760
can get a lot out of formal

849
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,200
specifications without doing

850
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,599
verification all the way down to the

851
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,240
implementation next slide please

852
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,060
so as an example we worked on a formal

853
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,099
specification of the quick transport

854
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,560
protocol where we were using a language

855
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,359
called Ivy that looks like an abstract

856
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,119
programming language to do a wire

857
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,060
specification of quick and this was at a

858
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,220
level of detail that was sufficient that

859
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,740
the specification itself could interact

860
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,440
directly with the clients and servers

861
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,599
and we used it to automatically generate

862
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,940
tests for compliance for a bunch of

863
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,619
servers and clients that were being

864
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,020
developed and what we found was we

865
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,420
exposed a lot of errors that didn't come

866
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,780
out in interoperability testing a lot of

867
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,599
those were compliance errors where we

868
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,579
either misinterpreted the spec you know

869
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,800
or the implementer did or there was an

870
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,660
ambiguity in the spec and a lot where

871
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,760
even low-level code crashes that just

872
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,960
weren't exposed by uh by testing so a

873
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,400
lot of those errors in turn were

874
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,320
potentially exploitable for example we

875
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,260
found a case where you could exploit

876
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,300
um the flow control mechanism in quick

877
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,820
in order to read arbitrary memory out of

878
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,680
the server or a case where you could

879
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,800
have a denial of service that exploited

880
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,140
the client migration feature of quick

881
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,180
next slide please

882
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,700
so one of the takeaways from this then

883
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,579
is that interoperability testing isn't

884
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,800
really enough because it doesn't tell us

885
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,540
whether the implementations are really

886
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,359
compliant to the RFC and that can give

887
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,579
us a lot of issues especially security

888
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,220
issues when we get non-compliant

889
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,079
implementations out in the wild this

890
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,579
happened for example with downgrade

891
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:41,280
attacks in SSO formal specification

892
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,500
could be part of that solution because

893
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,400
it allows us to find out before things

894
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
get in the wild whether they're really

895
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,839
compliant so there's a lot of research

896
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,579
left to do here there are hard

897
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,500
trade-offs between readability of the

898
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,619
specs testing issues formal proof and so

899
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,900
on but what we're mainly interested here

900
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,480
is try to understand how formal

901
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,339
specifications can be usefully and

902
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:08,220
practically integrated into the ietf

903
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,619
process and if you're interested in this

904
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,020
topic there's a meeting coming on up on

905
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,880
Thursday of the usable formal methods

906
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,040
research group or please contact us

907
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,900
directly and we love to to hear from you

908
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,850
thank you

909
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:26,280
[Applause]

910
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,700
so the next person that's on our list is

911
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,839
uh

912
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,940
is uh

913
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:38,099
Rich uh kulowak and

914
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,099
I am not seeing him in Meet Echo he was

915
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,579
expected to be remote he's lost power at

916
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,480
his house twice in two days he let us

917
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,980
know that he was trying to join using uh

918
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,560
the neighbors bandwidth but he said

919
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,540
web pages were painful so he didn't

920
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,060
think he could get in on

921
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,240
um on meat Echo and if he's not if he's

922
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,300
not here it's not for lack of trying uh

923
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,140
his slides are uploaded to the

924
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,420
um Santa Tracker and

925
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,599
you know available here uh so if this

926
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,560
looks like an interesting topic to you

927
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,380
please please follow up with Rich

928
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,460
uh that brings us to uh Sam Hurst

929
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,339
and next up is uh Ignacio

930
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,460
hi I'm Sam Hurst I uh I'm a project r d

931
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,780
engineer with BBC research and

932
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,420
development uh looking mainly at media

933
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,359
streaming uh and uh I'd like to touch it

934
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,700
about my little project which is uh

935
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,380
trying to run set over quick transport

936
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,540
so next slide please

937
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,660
uh so it is just a mapping of uh session

938
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,060
initialization Pro sorry session

939
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,099
initiation protocol over quick transport

940
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,980
very much inspired by HTTP 3's mapping

941
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,839
given that sip is quite close to http

942
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,319
1.1 uh the original idea came from uh

943
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,260
some work I did on trying to run RTP

944
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,420
over quick but one of the problems I was

945
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,460
having was okay well I can send media

946
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,140
but how do I negotiate that in a nice

947
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,400
way

948
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,800
um and specifically when uh the use case

949
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,140
I was looking at which is there is a

950
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,880
reporter in a field trying to get some

951
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,400
uh media back so we can put it on the

952
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,339
news uh maybe they are on a connection

953
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,599
they don't particularly trust we want

954
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,119
just one single encrypted tunnel so

955
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,520
quick looked quite nice for that

956
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
um the idea of sending live media over

957
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,300
quick is a very active topic so there's

958
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,440
obviously the New Media of a quick

959
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,240
working group there's stuff in avt core

960
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,760
as well uh talking about this uh so yes

961
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,079
we've been looking at the possibility of

962
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,300
reusing uh system magnetics to do

963
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,220
control metadata for that next slide

964
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,900
please

965
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,900
uh so like I say it's inspired by HTTP 3

966
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,640
um so I've got data frames in there for

967
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,420
carrying uh the Sip requests uh headers

968
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,280
are using keypad compression

969
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,420
um specifically just so that we can

970
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,280
reuse a lot of the existing HTTP 3

971
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,780
Stacks so it should be hopefully easier

972
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,599
to implement uh so like I said before

973
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,160
the intention is to allow for media

974
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,960
sessions to use the same quick transport

975
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,060
connection to do the media and all of

976
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,400
the control uh and

977
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,079
specifically the design that I've come

978
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,480
up with uh decouples the quick client

979
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,579
and the quick server from the user agent

980
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,400
client and the user agent server in zip

981
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,680
but I've also kept unidirectional

982
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,339
unidirectional stream types and

983
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:36,720
datagrams available for the media

984
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,099
transport next slide please

985
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:42,839
uh so the internet is now actually up on

986
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,280
data tracker I managed to do that on

987
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,440
Avanti train Wi-Fi amazingly on the way

988
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,560
down uh this morning uh so please do go

989
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,520
and have a look at that if you're

990
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,560
interested happy accept any and all

991
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,880
feedback but I'm also specifically

992
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,400
looking for what Avenue is the best

993
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,839
place to continue this work is this

994
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,520
something for sip core is there

995
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,900
something for avt core or is this

996
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,819
something that should be living in mock

997
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,619
um so that's everything from me thank

998
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,500
you very much for listening

999
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,969
[Applause]

1000
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,020
so uh we should have Iglesia and uh

1001
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,020
foreign

1002
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,440
from the University Queen Mary of London

1003
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,240
and I have a question for you which is

1004
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,940
uh how is the idea of doing and that's

1005
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,619
what I've been trying to analyze with

1006
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:39,540
some colleagues slide please

1007
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,940
and we have been crunching and looking

1008
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,880
into the emails the drafts the rfcs how

1009
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,980
long it takes and many other details and

1010
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,960
what we find is that the conversation

1011
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,300
seems to be increasingly complex it

1012
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,800
seems to be increasingly harder to

1013
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,660
publish and it seems like there is an

1014
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,119
influential minority that is growing

1015
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,880
increasingly relevant inside of the ITF

1016
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,819
uh next slide please

1017
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:05,220
and if this sounds interesting we have

1018
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,780
been working together with colleagues

1019
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,280
from the University of Glasgow and we

1020
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,619
have already published some papers which

1021
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,140
have much more details and this is part

1022
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,520
of a broader project called so the

1023
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,819
stream next slide please

1024
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,040
and as a part of this we're also trying

1025
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,020
to create tools that might help the

1026
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,560
community in particular right now we are

1027
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,480
developing a tool for a supporting

1028
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,359
crossover review uh if you scan that QR

1029
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,339
code that will bring you to the website

1030
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,380
and the tool is there and we are trying

1031
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,480
to find good matches between drops and

1032
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,760
reviewers and we do this by using a

1033
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,920
combination of our NLP tools and social

1034
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,500
network analysis uh if this sounds

1035
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,420
interesting please help us we need a

1036
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,920
little bit of information to Chrome

1037
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,800
truth the findings that we have we are

1038
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,839
also preparing a few other things to

1039
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,660
gather more information like a survey on

1040
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,000
uh like the survey that I'm saying and

1041
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,740
if this in general sounds interesting

1042
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,240
and sounds like something that you think

1043
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,160
that more people should be doing we have

1044
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,260
a side meeting uh with the idea of

1045
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,900
preparing a research group called rasp

1046
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,839
research on internet standards processes

1047
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,240
and that will happen on Thursday and

1048
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,920
everybody is welcome to join thank you

1049
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,820
very much

1050
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,859
[Applause]

1051
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:23,520
and next speaker is uh uh Hans Dieter

1052
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,359
and I I wanted to congratulate uh

1053
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,780
Ignacio because this is the first lrc

1054
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,880
talk I've seen where you actually tried

1055
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,160
to put people to work while you were

1056
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,399
talking

1057
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,619
so uh

1058
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,760
thank you my name is I work at the CWI

1059
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,640
in Leiden in the Netherlands in the past

1060
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,380
couple of years I've completed the

1061
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,940
research project supported by the Next

1062
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,339
Generation internet initiative

1063
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:59,160
next slide please and during this

1064
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,640
research project we were basically

1065
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,099
studying synchronization over over the

1066
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:07,079
Internet how you can synchronize

1067
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,200
components and we made a kind of a

1068
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,140
discovery or at least we founded we

1069
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,380
found an ID that we we thought was very

1070
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,180
interesting to to share so that's what I

1071
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,760
want to do right here uh you know

1072
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,920
probably Shannon's information Theory

1073
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,440
right this uh basic idea of what

1074
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,300
information theory is you could code and

1075
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,119
decode and then you can use basically

1076
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,240
bits to encode any kind of message that

1077
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,440
you want

1078
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,599
um but the problem with this notion is

1079
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,920
that this is a Time insensitive notion

1080
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,420
whenever you encode it this is done

1081
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,480
statically you don't regard the moment

1082
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,220
when you encode it or the moment that

1083
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,500
you decoded

1084
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,500
and so it seems that this capacity of a

1085
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,540
channel measured in bits per second is

1086
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,359
sufficient next slide please

1087
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,359
uh but it turns out that you can

1088
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,700
introduce a so-called site Channel and

1089
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,000
also Shannon was aware of this ID but

1090
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,119
this is less wide widely known uh what

1091
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,160
the idea of a side channel in in this

1092
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,400
case time is is that if you have two uh

1093
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,380
processes that are synchronized in time

1094
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,020
so that they have a clock running at the

1095
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,960
same speed then you can send a signal

1096
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,780
just a single signal and the moment of

1097
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,119
reception is then significant and

1098
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,220
whenever you synchronize these machines

1099
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,920
that you can send just with a single

1100
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,839
signal more information than is present

1101
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,599
within the signal and so then we have

1102
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,040
basically ethereum which is that the

1103
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,839
effective capacity is higher than the

1104
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,960
capacity and now an important new

1105
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,059
measure that you have to also consider

1106
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,760
is that of Jitter which is unpredictable

1107
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,800
variation in the delay whenever you

1108
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,099
communicate next slide please

1109
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:57,180
so for based on this Insight we

1110
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,400
basically want to develop a new Internet

1111
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,220
Protocol called TMP standing for time

1112
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,400
modulation protocol we are really in the

1113
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,440
research stage right now and it would be

1114
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,540
really nice to get into contact with

1115
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,660
more people Hazard for instance to

1116
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,000
collaborate on prototypes but also for

1117
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,859
working on better models for predicting

1118
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,619
delays let me end with what are the

1119
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:21,119
potential benefits of using this

1120
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,640
protocol there is a potential increase

1121
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,760
of effective capacity which might be

1122
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,020
interesting whenever you want to send

1123
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,420
more data than whatever is metered on

1124
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,960
links and very important for end users

1125
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,579
application is that you could increase

1126
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,599
confidentiality by hiding data in time

1127
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,620
uh thank you very much

1128
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:48,300
[Applause]

1129
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,220
so I've got uh Dan Sexton uh

1130
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:56,400
coming up next and then uh Travis uh you

1131
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,119
will be our uh last requester for

1132
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,720
conversation

1133
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,020
can you hear me okay

1134
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,200
thank you very well thank you uh so

1135
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,359
hello everyone this is my first uh time

1136
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,480
attending I ietf uh and I come with a

1137
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,020
question a a challenge which is is

1138
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,000
privacy preserving web filtering

1139
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,500
possible if I can have the next slide

1140
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,940
please

1141
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,339
foreign

1142
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:29,339
work at the iwf we're a charity in the

1143
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,260
UK and we work to find a remove child

1144
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,579
sexual abuse material from the internet

1145
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,339
a really crucial part of that work has

1146
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:37,319
been providing data to Industry to

1147
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,900
enable detection blocking filtering of

1148
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,440
known content um by platforms isps and

1149
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,020
filters as Internet standards have

1150
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,000
developed and encryption has become more

1151
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,400
commonplace those methods have become

1152
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,980
less effective it's been harder to

1153
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,160
detect it's been hard to to block so the

1154
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,119
challenge really is uh it can legitimate

1155
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,220
legal web filtering coexist with secure

1156
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,740
and private internet can advance as an

1157
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,079
encryption and privacy enhancing

1158
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,540
Technologies be used to filter harmful

1159
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,020
web content without compromising user

1160
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,559
privacy for the next slide please

1161
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,900
uh so what I'm here to do is to to try

1162
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,180
to engage with the community

1163
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,940
um to talk about the issue to find out

1164
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,440
about any existing work that might

1165
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,599
already be going on in this space

1166
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,059
um and or similar Technologies privacy

1167
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,220
enhancing technologies that were used in

1168
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,920
other areas that might be uh made to

1169
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,220
work with um web filtering I have a

1170
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,800
public side meeting on Tuesday at 3 30

1171
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,319
in Richmond six and I would encourage

1172

anyone that is interested in the topic

1173
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,339
or might be able to post some challenges

1174
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:49,640
or potential solutions that might

1175
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,260
develop into maybe a future proposal or

1176
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,960
a standard implementation

1177
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,359
um so very welcome if people are able to

1178

1186
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:28,079
behalf of the spec core team for Matrix

1187
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,819
um not a lot of time but a lot of

1188
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,200
information so I am going to speedrun

1189
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,880
this please try and find me afterwards

1190
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,460
or just message us on the uh Mimi

1191
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,839
mailing list if I can get the next slide

1192
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:37,680
please

1193
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,480
uh so there are three major questions

1194
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,339
that I would like to sort of cover uh

1195
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:44,280
first what is Mimi uh why are we doing

1196
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,619
this uh how does it affect us as Matrix

1197
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:48,900
and sort of where are we at currently if

1198
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,760
I can get the next side

1199
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,920
uh so yeah what is Mimi next slide

1200
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,240
please

1201
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,160
uh Mimi is the more instant message

1202
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,200
interoperability working group currently

1203
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,020
here at the ietf uh they are being or

1204
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,940
they're having a buff on Wednesday to

1205
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,400
actually form themselves uh into a

1206
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,500
proper working group and it's created a

1207
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,300
lot of an interest for the eu's digital

1208
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,359
markets act or dma so in that dma

1209
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,640
Gatekeepers or large Messengers are

1210
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,140
required to uh interop with each other

1211
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,880
as well as other sort of Messengers in

1212
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,859
the space as Matrix we think this is a

1213
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,119
good thing because Matrix is an

1214
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,680
interoperable open standard for security

1215
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,780
centralized communication and you might

1216
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,280
see where this is going if I can get the

1217
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,540
next slide please

1218
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,520
uh So currently Gatekeepers kind of look

1219
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,440
like this today where you have uh you

1220
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,819
know say WhatsApp and Instagram they're

1221
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:37,260
able to communicate with each other and

1222
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,700
then Twitter's kind of off to its side

1223
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,339
and there are others of course so uh

1224
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,200
with the next slide

1225
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,240
um the dma kind of wants something like

1226
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,859
this where you just apply magic in the

1227
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:48,119
middle and then they're able to talk to

1228
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:51,359
each other uh next slide please uh the

1229
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,520
trick though is that with encryption uh

1230
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,960
maintained the entire way through so

1231
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,059
because WhatsApp supports encryption uh

1232
00:56:57,059 --> 00:56:58,020
all three would need to support

1233
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,460
encryption and anybody else sort of in

1234
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,339
that conversation so next slide please

1235
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:05,160
uh so how would we do that next slide

1236
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,040
with Matrix next slide

1237
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,300
um so with Matrix use for

1238
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,619
interoperability you convert everything

1239
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:12,660
to a home server at least on this sort

1240
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,280
of public internet front so they're able

1241
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,559
to communicate with each other uh and

1242
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,200
briefly uh next slide

1243
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,940
uh these are the sorts of bits that

1244
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,079
we'll need so it's just the Federation

1245
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,540
API from Matrix extensible events that's

1246
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,160
just the format that we sent over the

1247
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,780
wire and then a governance process to

1248
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,760
actually make sure that Matrix can be

1249
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,980
properly Incorporated uh we're gonna

1250
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,500
skip the next three slides

1251
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,140
uh these are just the bits uh the slides

1252
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,200
are up on there uh next slide please

1253
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,599
um so where are we currently at

1254
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,520
um next slide

1255
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,040
uh this is the rough timeline so Matrix

1256
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,599
was created back in 2014. we're

1257
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,099
currently November 22 where maybe

1258
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,839
becomes a working group and we have a

1259
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,280
lot of conversations ahead of us and

1260
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,980
we're hoping that uh you know Matrix

1261
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,960
will be sort of adopted eventually and

1262
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,880
that's kind of our goal here uh next

1263
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,440
slide please

1264
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,260
uh so how can you help next slide just

1265
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,420
let us know uh what do you think uh how

1266
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,559
can we actually make this kind of work

1267
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:10,200
in a governance process uh that sort of

1268
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,000
stuff if you're on Matrix that's the

1269
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,980
room to sort of talk to uh if not

1270
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,579
otherwise just come talk to me after or

1271
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:18,300
um

1272
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,640
yeah on the mailing list uh but that's

1273
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,779
all just next slide please

1274
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,319
[Applause]

1275
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:35,220
so this brings us to the end right yes

1276
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,280
this brings us to the end of our uh time

1277
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,819
together at ietf 115.

1278
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,940
um I've asked for I'd ask for you to uh

1279
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,160
think about maybe three things as you're

1280
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,980
on your way to the bar this week

1281
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,900
um

1282
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,480
first let people know what you've

1283
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,480
thought about this format and whether

1284
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,079
whether it seemed helpful to you or not

1285
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:05,240
um we got one request to uh present

1286
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,540
about uh 40 minutes before the social

1287
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,299
started and we were able to we were able

1288
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:16,260
to do that thanks to a lot of assistance

1289
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,619
from the Secretariat so please

1290
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:22,500
I tell people what you uh appreciate

1291
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,720
about them also

1292
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,720
um

1293
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,859
anybody can talk

1294
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,339
at HUD RFC

1295
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:36,599
if you think that it would be

1296
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:38,819
interesting for you to talk about ideas

1297
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:40,140
you have

1298
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,359
uh and that this seems to be a helpful

1299
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,099
place

1300
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:46,920
be thinking about that we're actually on

1301
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,760
the

1302
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,960
agenda on a ongoing basis now uh

1303
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,839
and uh

1304
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:59,339
so you can be thinking about uh what to

1305
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:01,579
send in and expect that there'll be a

1306
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:04,680
call for president uh

1307
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,619
president proposals

1308
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:10,380
and uh

1309
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,220
I think the third thing is if this seems

1310
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,940
helpful to you and you'd like to help

1311
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,900

01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,099
ietf.org

1315
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:34,079
and uh we'll see we'll see what we can

1316
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,099
