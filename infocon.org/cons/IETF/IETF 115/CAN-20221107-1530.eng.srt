1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,099
when you ask questions and please go

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,200
back to the note taker to make sure your

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,599
names and affiliations are clearly

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,420
recorded if it's not please edit

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,880
yourself everybody is encouraged to take

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,119
to write notes in the in the ietf note

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,520
page

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,439
okay so

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,960
um first is the node well

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,779
and I hope that you have seen this page

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,840
before you're in this room participating

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,079
be aware of the knows well identified

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,980
here next page

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,700
so Computing aware networking is a

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,260
pretty big uh area and this has been

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,480
um I'm sorry

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,719
we had a we had a bath

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,039
um two ietfs ago and this time the

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,699
proponents have narrowed the scope of

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,680
the work and they make this to be the

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,100
home to discuss how the availability of

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,700
computing related resources this is not

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,460
just Computing but also storage or

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,500
something else associated with the

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,439
places or sites which hosts the compute

26
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,860
servers how they impact the routing

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,759
decisions

28
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,680
um so mainly forwarding um mainly

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
focusing on the routing aspect

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,340
um

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,340
um and forwarding uh focusing on service

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,520
instances that with one address going

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,820
towards multiple destinations uh

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,060
typically known as any cast

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,420
um within one administrative domain

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,780
and here are some useful information our

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,619
mailing list can at

38
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,299
ietf.org

39
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,820
encourage everybody here to sign up

40
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,340
subscribe to the mailing list if you

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,818
have not and there's also the

42
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,180
information about what it is

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,940
the GitHub to which has information

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,140
about the scope and some of the

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,720
experiment they have done by the

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,400
proponents

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,220
okay next page please

48
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,780
so

49
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,840
the focus of this bath I want to make

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,420
sure that this is not for discussing

51
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,040
Solutions but primarily to demonstrate

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,480
the uh problem space and to make sure

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,180
um the community is aware of what

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,360
problem to be solved and also

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,300
um get the

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,660
agreement if ietf is the right group to

57
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,459
attempt to solve the problem

58
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,000
and second is do we have critical math

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,019
in our people willing to contribute and

60
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,500
including writing drafts or review other

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,440
people's stress to any future potential

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,400
Solutions or other things included

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,560
another important thing for this above

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,900
is to make sure the scope is very well

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,819
defined and make sure we don't avoid the

66
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,060
ocean to do everything under the sky to

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,319
solve this problem

68
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,120
okay so

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,300
um so for this uh make sure everybody's

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,659
clear that this path is for problems in

71
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,799
the routing domain next page please

72
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,120
so here's a brief agenda uh we have

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,620
um proponents present the use cases

74
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,019
scenarios and problem statements and

75
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,879
there's also another one for the Gap

76
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,819
analysis yes can I interrupt for just a

77
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,500
minute um

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,180
there are a lot of people clustered by

79
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,860
the exit probably in contravention of

80
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,319
various fire codes I'm just guessing

81
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,019
um there's a lot of open seats

82
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,120
um if people next to open seats can

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,980
either raise their hand to indicate or

84
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,019
shift in or something that would be

85
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,480
helpful thank you very much

86
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,839
[Music]

87
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,018
foreign

88
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,240
and they will have a quick discussion of

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,300
the current proposed Charter and then we

90
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,280
will have a big chunk of time for the

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,740
charter discussions

92
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,900
um then we'll have 80 giving a few words

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,580
to wrap it up

94
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,380
thank you next page

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,699
um so with that I think we are ready for

96
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,060
the use case and the requirement

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,520
discussion so let's bring up

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,698
foreign

99
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,040
while we're teeing up this speaker just

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
a reminder to everyone that if you're

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,100
not actively eating or drinking please

102
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,960
remember to raise your mask up again

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,940
thank you

104
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,440
definitely

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,820
access okay

106
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,539
and I will present the use case so

107
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,500
first

108
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,139
and first is the history about Camp work

109
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,160
it works development from the diecast

110
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,440
World which has three style meetings

111
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,880
from 2019 and I'm talking about use case

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,940
and also some technique details such as

113
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,020
flow affinity and then we have a non-wg

114
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,639
camp of

115
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,660
in itf113 unfortunately we got a pretty

116
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,960
good result about the use case but not

117
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,940
gonna get the consensus about the

118
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,460
solutions and we also received 36

119
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,639
issues and we are responsible to

120
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,220
response to them to the Middle East

121
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,620
GitHub and also copied to the question

122
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,220
nodes and

123
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,400
for the last idea meeting we present the

124
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,080
progress in the RDG area and

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,800
tsbwg to to promote small consensus so

126
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,380
uh in baseball we focus on the problems

127
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,259
based on the use case based on the

128
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,660
levels of consensus on the on them have

129
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,419
been reached and so many operators and

130
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,300
vendors are interested in this works so

131
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,400
we also hope that no solution discussed

132
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,720
in this world

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,800
uh exercise

134
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,960
so now we focus the camp work um loading

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
area it considers utilizing the

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,520
Computing related results conditions in

137
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,759
traffic steering decisions especially

138
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,520
quickly can focus on impacting rotate

139
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,220
loading decisions through propagating

140
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,080
the competing results metrics to

141
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,780
interested nodes uh for instance the

142
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,520
Ingress nodes

143
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,900
answer the police

144
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,880
so here's a quote from our responsible

145
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,680
lady John

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,900
um he said the outcome of the previous

147
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,960
buff was that there were support that

148
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,900
the problem is legitimate but there was

149
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,300
no consensus around the approach being

150
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,759
proposed for Solutions so therefore

151
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,759
guidance this time around words to focus

152
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,580
on the great part the problem and going

153
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,460
forward people with Solutions can make

154
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,120
the their case if a WJ is chartered and

155
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
here's our considerations

156
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,860
there are many downloading based

157
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,780
Solutions out there and there are other

158
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,180
IDF working groups working on the

159
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,699
downloading based Solutions but those

160
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,259
Solutions are not enough for some

161
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,720
scenarios which are demonstrated later

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,660
and we are making a case to have a very

163
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,080
narrowly scoped WG to address how remote

164
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,080
metrics impact floating decisions

165
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,699
um because we don't want to boil the

166
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,479
ocean

167
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,620
next class please

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,259
it shows a rapid development of the

169
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,779
integrated ICT infrastructure different

170
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,080
from the past the operators are offering

171
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,539
the integrated competing and network

172
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,179
network infrastructure

173
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,899
um some Syrian nodes has been installed

174
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,779
and this node can be upgraded to

175
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,339
visiting and then at completing

176
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,740
infrastructure and difference is that

177
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,440
more diverse Computing results needed to

178
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,040
be provided comparing to the original

179
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,600
content

180
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,940
providing service

181
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,220
and there will be more Edge Computing

182
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,360
nodes

183
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,100
um

184
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,380
demand manner he has a typical analysis

185
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,080
result shows that so many Edge Computing

186
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,180
nodes will be settled in the country

187
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,820
aggregation access application and on

188
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,720
site

189
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,899
and now somewhere has around 1000

190
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,760
outside in more than 20 uh more than 200

191
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,080
cities and 200 percent increasing rate

192
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,700
comparing to the last year

193
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,760
and in China there's at least

194
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
2585

195
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,959
operators to showing the increasing

196
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,640
service providers over in the

197
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,779
infrastructure as I suppose

198
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,660
so why does Edge infrastructure develop

199
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,060
so fast because users want the best

200
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,300
experience such as low latency and high

201
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,459
availability the emerging new Services

202
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,740
intelligent Transportation shows that

203
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,140
and the user also one stable service

204
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,180
experience when moving around different

205
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,080
areas and in times of changing demand

206
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,959
the mobile network brings more comedians

207
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,019
for for the users to use a lightweight

208
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,480
EOS get more service

209
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,200
and how to make user comment uh one

210
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
point is to deploy instance for the same

211
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,140
service across the virus outside for the

212
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,320
better availability to provide the

213
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
functional equivalency and another point

214
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,660
is the under traffic dynamically to the

215
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,540
best service instance because traffic is

216
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,420
delivered to the optimal ad site based

217
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,519
on the information that includes

218
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,399
Computing information

219
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,019
at the same time the definition of best

220
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,600
may be service specific maybe the

221
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,180
appropriate but exercise please

222
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,860
um though we have this out about to to

223
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,579
meet the users uh demand the reality is

224
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,940
competing has uh advantage of closed but

225
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,040
in some cases the closest is not the

226
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,079
best for the service because of the

227
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,160
virus of the company status innate the

228
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,880
closest site may not have enough results

229
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,339
particularly when load flag shades

230
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,500
and the closest style may not have

231
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,839
enough specific results

232
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,200
for example support folders big specific

233
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Hardware or software

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,380
and which will explain in the later yeah

235
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,140
in exercise please

236
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,260
and here we use three slides to to show

237
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,740
that the Trap steering based on the uh

238
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,220
Computing results variety yeah so uh it

239
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,620
shows a common deployment deployment of

240
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,440
the ad Computing The Edge data center in

241
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,019
the metro area with high convenient

242
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,079
results provide the service to many UVS

243
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,360
in material especially in the working

244
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,880
time because there was Office Buildings

245
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,180
in the metro area and at the same time

246
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,100
there was also The Limited company

247
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,720
results

248
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,540
in the remote to provide a service to

249
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,240
the to the field areas close to the

250
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,380
remote outside and in this case the

251
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,540
service request and the committing

252
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,940
results messed up well and there was

253
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,940
only some potential traffic steering uh

254
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,440
if needed

255
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,720
and please remember the location of the

256
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,000
US which will move in next slide please

257
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,800
so uh in the non-working time for

258
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,079
example in the weekend of the daily

259
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,360
night the UVS will move from the metro

260
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,240
area to remote Edge because because

261
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,360
their house was close to the

262
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,139
to the remote Edge and there will be

263
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,620
more service required close to the

264
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,339
remote Edge but the company yourself is

265
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,800
not enough so some traffic need to be

266
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,399
there back to the Metro Center and it is

267
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,680
only for one or two days can justify

268
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,160
adding servers to the remote site

269
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,740
next size please

270
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,959
and it has also showed the case that

271
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,260
some certain events for example some

272
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,660
shopping day or the

273
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,660
Central

274
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,800
and then activities

275
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,579
um to to to make make the traffic either

276
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,339
need to be steering among the different

277
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,019
ad sites

278
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,420
um because it also unplanned and you

279
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,560
can't find the ability of of the of the

280
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,360
US move so this shows another piece for

281
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,380
the traffic steering yeah

282
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,180
and here's the first considerations the

283
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,519
high company results needed by you at

284
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,560
remote site for short period of time

285
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,560
which is not long enough to justify

286
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
adding more competing results at the

287
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,459
remote sites so the traffic may be

288
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,980
cleared among different exercise

289
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,440
so this is the first part of the use

290
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,100
case and for the next part welcome Luis

291
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,139
from telephone phonical to friend

292
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,920
but take short pause here so the people

293
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,719
in the back can find their seats

294
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,019
okay

295
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,760
folks in the back of the room please

296
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,399
find a seat with instead of just staying

297
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,079
at the at the door

298
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,579
oops

299
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,540
foreign

300
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,100
traffic so we will try to illustrate

301
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,199
this with the use cases where the

302
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,300
overall idea is to take into

303
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,899
consideration not on I mean to going to

304
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,160
enrich the decision combining

305
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,920
information from the application site

306
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,199
from the resources side in the edge but

307
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,300
together combined with the information

308
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,459
in the network site as well so next

309
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,560
please

310
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,000
so uh so for example

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,860
we can

312
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,360
consider this of computing aware a

313
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
materiality virtual reality so in in any

314
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,579
service we will have for sure to access

315
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,399
to one application to a service function

316
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,600
or a number of service functions

317
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,360
delivered in some service so we will

318
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
have some dependencies we will have

319
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,779
dependencies on the kind of Terminals

320
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,720
and processing times I spent on the user

321
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,620
side

322
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,320
similarly to the application side and

323
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,720
also we need to have into consideration

324
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,940
the time for reaching where this

325
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,820
application is running in order to come

326
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,399
to consider the delayed budget that we

327
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,740
have available we cannot do too much on

328
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,440
the terminals height or in the process

329
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,360
height for sure there could be ways of

330
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,060
optimization and that part but we can

331
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,920
consider those as a static and priority

332
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,420
out of the control of the of the

333
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,820
operator so the only thing what we can

334
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,579
play with is the the reachability how

335
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:02,100
far or how how much time we can spend

336
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,140
from the budget delay in reaching the

337
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,419
unspecific service so in the sample that

338
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,160
you can see there we could consider that

339
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,619
we have the the different applications

340
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,699
to in three different energy sites one

341
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,040
of them imposing a delay of 99

342
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,839
milliseconds another one impossible

343
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,000
delay of four milliseconds and a third

344
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,579
one imposing a delay of five

345
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,919
milliseconds so it would consider as

346
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,799
fixed the time employed by the client in

347
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,400
in order to processing and and do their

348
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,860
job for consuming the application we see

349
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,780
that the only option at least in this

350
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,820
particular case would be one of the

351
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,280
obviously the three edges so if we

352
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
decouple or or if we take the decision

353
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,700
all the application takes the decision

354
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,200
decoupled from the information on the

355
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,700
network could be the case that the

356
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,679
application could decide to select one

357
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,480
of the other two instead of the the

358
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,880
optimal one in order to fit to the

359
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,740
delayed budget

360
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,320
next please

361
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,179
this will be another example where it is

362
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,280
important to take me to consideration

363
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,320
the the combined information between the

364
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,020
network and the application as I

365
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,480
mentioned before by my pen probably in

366
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,120
what here we have a case where there is

367
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,299
a number of cars moving around and uh

368
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,820
having available a number of edge sites

369
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,740
for retrieving information there will be

370
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,460
applications that could

371
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,200
require low latency so now there's a

372
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,700
good record headband with so in

373
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,620
principle we could have these

374
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,820
applications could be served from the

375
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,700
different edges however and not always

376
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,980
the closest environment would be the

377
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,260
best for the service maybe because we

378
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,340
don't have enough resources for

379
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,260
processing the information and maybe we

380
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,820
could affect some decision of the

381
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,760
systems and so so in this case we try to

382
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,700
simplify that that point that the idea

383
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,860
would be to select the best one with

384
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,860
enough resources enough capabilities for

385
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,539
um satisfying the low literacy

386
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,740
requirements but also the high value

387
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,360
requirements in such a way that we don't

388
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,000
affect the application but also

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
respecting the overall delay budget so

390
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,400
finally having this combined

391
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,140
optimization between the the transport

392
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,780
side of the network side sorry and the

393
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,760
application side as well so next please

394
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,450
so the

395
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,140
[Music]

396
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,980
um

397
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,900
essentially the the point and the key

398
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,460
message from this kind of services that

399
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,299
combine resources and in the networks in

400
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,559
the network side and also in the

401
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,720
computer side is to have a combined

402
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,580
optimization and a combined decision

403
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,740
that could considering a simultaneously

404
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,820
the network and the compute part so

405
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,720
moving or transitioning from the

406
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
decoupling decision that we have today

407
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,799
to an integrated decision considering

408
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,299
both parts

409
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,260
next please

410
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,919
so that the categories from the use

411
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,260
cases that I commented so essentially

412
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,880
the traffic can be still among different

413
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,000
sites so we have somehow the possibility

414
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,620
of Designing uh web so and this opens

415
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,020
the possibility of optimizing the such a

416
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,940
decision

417
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,340
um and for that decision essentially we

418
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,380
need to consider the the impacts on the

419
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,200
compute side and also the network side

420
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,660
next please

421
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,559
so uh this slide summarized some

422
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,720
so another interactions that we we had

423
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
in uh in the previous months so that

424
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,179
there are other activities in in other

425
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,940
bodies so how the idea here would be to

426
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,039
leverage on ITF or defining the

427
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,280
Solutions in within the routing area

428
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
um also is important to highlight the

429
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,960
fact that the compute environment is

430
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
something very much Dynamic is diverse

431
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,340
in terms of solutions but also is

432
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,960
varying around the time because the

433
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,460
different applications could be consumed

434
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,179
in different resources so is so how very

435
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,700
very much Dynamic so this is why it is

436
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,620
important to have this possibility of

437
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,419
combining and trying to optimize both

438
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,400
together

439
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,260
um let me just highlight the the latest

440
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,360
point in the lower part of the slide so

441
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,520
we receive a number of an important

442
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,140
number of comments and issues in the

443
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,200
GitHub 36 of them so we have tried to to

444
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,940
answer all of them this does not mean

445
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,620
that the issues has been closed the

446
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,140
discussion is is open and yet ongoing

447
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,600
but just to I mean to highlight the

448
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
point that we are

449
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
generating too much discussion on this

450
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,900
topic

451
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,299
so next please

452
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,780
I will okay

453
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,539
thank you thank you very much

454
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,419
um is any clarification questions any

455
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,980
one

456
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,860
so I'm curious APN was canceled what's

457
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,320
the difference between can and APN

458
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,480
number one number two uh what was

459
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,980
presented here is more or less

460
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,740
policy-based routing you define a policy

461
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,960
based on the policy the traffic is being

462
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,659
routed what is part of that policy can

463
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,760
be multiple things not just

464
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,360
latency as an example so that's the one

465
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,820
part the use cases that you're

466
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,679
presenting especially one with the

467
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,179
self-driving cars

468
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,059
too much into the future

469
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:14,659
what would be some of the real use cases

470
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:17,700
that that would today will be really

471
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,120
driving what is the right policy

472
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,820
or what would be the semantics to create

473
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,240
the right policy for the routing

474
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,200
so that's a lot of questions so so like

475
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,020
three questions I put it down so make it

476
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,659
simple for the presenters especially

477
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,539
they are not very good native speakers

478
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:42,179
yeah I mean maybe you should just like

479
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,220
refresh because not everybody was in the

480
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,659
room when you sort of laid out the

481
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,600
meeting plan it's like you know there's

482
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,880
a bunch of time for like

483
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,980
big picture discussion at the end

484
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,340
correct yes yes yeah so that we do have

485
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,100
big longer discussion at the end

486
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,340
um with the charter and maybe the APN

487
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,919
may be difference to APN will be covered

488
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,559
right now just to the use cases they

489
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,520
presented here any specific questions

490
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,020
so we do have questions on the

491
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,240
on the Queue so

492
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,820
kitchen

493
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,580
[Music]

494
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,860
Cisco uh my question which I also put in

495
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,220
the chat is uh is this all about uh

496
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,620
anycast destinations or is there

497
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,139
something else as well

498
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:40,080
is it apart any cast yeah

499
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,140
should I answer yeah yes please okay I

500
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,179
will listen with my personal view so

501
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,039
this is somehow the program statement we

502
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
are not yet entering into Solutions

503
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,159
probably there will be different options

504
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,659
for that and it has could be some of

505
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,039
them but probably could be others as

506
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,840
well so

507
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,179
okay

508
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,460
okay so I understand it's not limited to

509
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,940
any cars in which case this is about

510
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,400
picking of our selection of uh the

511
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
destination addresses as well right for

512
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,440
the for the application or use case and

513
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,360
then my question would be isn't that

514
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,620
outside of routing space

515
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,900
um he's saying that if it's not about

516
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,059
any cousins is outside the routing so

517
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,640
let's defer that to the end of the show

518
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,400
so yeah just to repeat if it's about

519
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,059
applications using uh destinations based

520
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,980
on some metrics or some other criteria

521
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,780
then would that not be outside the

522
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,120
routing space that was so um let's

523
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,720
discuss that afterwards um so next one

524
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,100
um Chen Lee on the list

525
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,400
essential yeah actually like uh I think

526
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,960
we should focus on the use case firstly

527
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,240
in this presentation lots of questions

528
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,000
related to the solutions should be uh

529
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,520
Jose deferred to the next meeting maybe

530
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,380
yep thank you okay so next one is hung

531
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,780
up yeah oh Taurus you want to say

532
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,600
something yeah okay

533
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,640
so very early on when we started to do

534
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,260
routing protocols we're you know

535
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,260
implementing in things like er grp

536
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,299
um you know measured load aware routing

537
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,840
and then the consumption of the path uh

538
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,000
you know changed the load so that we

539
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,380
would get into a lot of fluctuating

540
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,320
Behavior so I'm wondering you know how

541
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,440
you would frame the problem so that you

542
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,659
make it clear how the consumption of the

543
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,340
services you're discovering and the

544
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,159
impact it has on the quality of the path

545
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,679
are taken into account or you know how

546
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,900
you think you have solutions to avoid

547
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,580
the fluctuation other problems we had in

548
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,820
the past

549
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,620
um I want to ask uh cutting for one

550
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,960
second so we have online participants

551
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,240
and so everyone in the room please also

552
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,500
use the queue on online tool to to get

553
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,440
in the queue that's signing is also

554
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,900
another way to uh to track the

555
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,299
participation the blue sheets so please

556
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,840
sign in even if you're in the room

557
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,260
okay so pen is your turn okay uh so for

558
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,539
the technical issues we also have the

559
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,000
government analysis in the next

560
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,799
advantage and for the use case we think

561
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,380
the two typical use cases we showed is

562
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,000
not really far away from now because

563
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,240
there are some deployment in the city

564
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,799
and we can we can see them and and for

565
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,100
the nvi it's really a strict uh demand

566
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,980
for the 20 million seconds and it's just

567
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,559
because there's no joint consideration

568
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,700
so uh that may be some of circle for the

569
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,380
relief uh

570
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,640
to provide at this time but we really to

571
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,020
to get the use case that is broadly uh

572
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,720
to see in this stage including the edge

573
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Computing yeah thanks okay so next one

574
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,799
is 10g

575
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,159
so are you have you signed up for the

576
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,200
list okay

577
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
um can we just live this discussion

578
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,140
until I finish my presentation on the

579
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,299
Gap analysis and the rack they have laid

580
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:19,980
the foundation about use case problem

581
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,159
statement and then now if I can talk

582
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,679
about the Gap and also requirement maybe

583
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,020
people have more ideal comments thank

584
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,799
you

585
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,039
okay so next one is rhyme rank pen

586
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,500
is he online hungry is the part of the

587
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,440
use case such as computer where we are

588
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,779
AR application and I'm interested in

589
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,720
autonomous driving scenarios I think

590
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,580
autonomous driving scenarios should

591
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,520
consider more mobile elements such as

592
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,779
UPF but it indeed is a potential

593
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:58,100
scenario foresee and sex

594
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,779
Okay so

595
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,159
phone

596
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,860
is a Conley

597
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,659
do you want to answer the question of

598
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,340
you couldn't get the question oh you

599
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,559
couldn't get the question okay so call

600
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,559
me okay

601
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,940
yes I'm online

602
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,240
okay I think it's important to consider

603
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,539
the Computing and network delay together

604
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:27,360
to provide an Integrity surveys uh SP in

605
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,700
addition to the use cases he mentioned

606
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,700
there I there is a industry control

607
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,240
scenario in the industry internet in

608
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,279
which Computing tasks need to be

609
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,539
performed

610
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,140
in each cloth or Regional data centers

611
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,140
and these tasks need to guarantee a

612
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,020
certain type time delayed to achieve the

613
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,279
current industry control so I agree with

614
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,779
the use case

615
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,460
thank you

616
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,900
thank you

617
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,260
um so uh your name and affiliation

618
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,980
please probably a pretty fundamental

619
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,200
clarifying question very brief here but

620
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,860
um

621
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,200
maybe it has been answered already but

622
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
it's not so clear to me when you talk

623
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,279
about applications so what's the

624
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,320
expectation of an application from the

625
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,899
network to take a decision right so this

626
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,539
is plain resources in terms of compute

627
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,399
storage or is there an expectation on

628
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,039
the availability of a function that uses

629
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,240
that storage

630
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,980
so is it kind of serverless

631
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,679
communication that we assume here or do

632
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,600
we assume something existing in the

633
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
infrastructure more than the compute

634
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,340
storage resources which is a network or

635
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,960
an application function

636
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,120
which is relevant for your question that

637
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,919
you had on the slide before what's what

638
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,799
is a decision criteria right

639
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,659
so we're considering the application so

640
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,460
how what we are considering is the the

641
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,200
availability of the the same kind of

642
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,960
workload in different places serving so

643
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,760
it could be in the form of serverless or

644
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,059
whatever other form so so how we need to

645
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,980
deal with the eligibility to those

646
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,059
applications of functions or how

647
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,960
however you could call it so it's such a

648
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,640
way to guarantee that we can accomplish

649
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,260
the slos that are

650
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,419
requested by the user at the end

651
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,760
so in some cases would be the

652
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,320
accessibility to the to the function

653
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,059
disorder this is the guarantee of the

654
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,500
resources made it before doing some

655
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,600
processing and guaranteeing maybe an

656
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,000
improved behavior of the application so

657
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,460
in this kind of decisions

658
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,799
can be taken Alone by the application so

659
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,779
this identiful is thinking on on a

660
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,120
streaming video solution also deciding

661
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,440
what kind of cash would be the one

662
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,299
delivered in the content or being

663
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,620
combined with information of the

664
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,940
networks in such a way that the decision

665
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,039
is enriched with the circumstances of

666
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,039
the status of yes so the definition of

667
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,500
resource goes beyond compute and storage

668
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,679
but includes a certain function that is

669
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,740
expected by the application right yeah

670
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,240
at the end

671
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,399
they did I mean I mean it could be only

672
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:04,340
the well I would say yes in general yes

673
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,480
okay so

674
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,480
um okay so Dirk is the next one

675
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,240
Dirk trollsen

676
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,299
Al

677
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,620
sorry how did you say actual tools for

678
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,640
the room

679
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,140
um there was a question about the use

680
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,600
cases before and and and the reference

681
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,279
to the use cases maybe being a little

682
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,779
bit far out

683
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,179
um as one of the examples we run

684
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,820
um you know about 25 different trials in

685
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,600
a in EU funded efforts on edge Computing

686
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,580
where we asked application developers to

687
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,820
develop use cases in AR VR Mobile gaming

688
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,419
of smart tourism to deploy their

689
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,520
application in a in an intelligent

690
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,720
environment which happened in three

691
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,179
different places in Europe and and it's

692
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,039
interesting to see when when Lewis makes

693
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,080
a statement about

694
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,600
um the expectation of best

695
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,580
um instance to be chosen is quite

696
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,919
different in those use cases and a lot

697
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,539
of these application developers come

698
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,120
from a an application Paradigm where

699
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,620
just pushing this into a central Cloud

700
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,020
gives them an infinite capacity but now

701
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,240
suddenly they're pushing it onto a base

702
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,820
station which has 12 cores and suddenly

703
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,980
they really have to calculate very well

704
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,779
you know um what kind of service

705
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,340
functionality gets there so that

706
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,080
material is available and I'm very happy

707
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,940
to I know we didn't have enough time to

708
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,140
bring this properly into the use case

709
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,179
graph but the site is in the use case

710
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,559
craft these are very these are great

711
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,059
insights from an application development

712
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,299
perspective as to what you expect and

713
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,640
how the network maybe struggles to

714
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,960
really fulfill those requirements

715
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,100
properly

716
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,779
thank you just want to give guys a

717
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:40,200
comment s Tony from Huawei so thank you

718
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,120
for the presentation I I just want to

719
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,820
mention that we we seem to forgot to

720
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,740
mention the name and the affiliation

721
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,380
before make the comments so we should

722
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,380
follow the rules yep thank you

723
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,960
so now thank you very much Luis so next

724
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,640
one we're going to present the Gap

725
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,399
analysis by Kenji from China mobile

726
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,480
yes

727
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,779
um okay you know

728
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,159
I well

729
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,980
um

730
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,919
from a pong and Lewis the presentation

731
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,840
on the use case and from statement there

732
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,940
are a lot a lot of questions already so

733
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,340
I can expect there are more questions

734
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,580
after I'm done with my presentation

735
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,860
with that in mind here I have to

736
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,659
emphasize in the previous slide

737
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:45,179
have laid a very uh solid foundation to

738
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,700
demonstrate two important and critical

739
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,640
points the first one is there is a

740
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,399
problem that is the the first takeaway

741
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,700
about okay something has to be done to

742
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,820
optimally steer traffic okay based on

743
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,700
you know you can call intelligent or or

744
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,039
kind of like a component those type of

745
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,799
things the second they have uh lay down

746
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,260
from there the second takeaway is

747
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,379
regarding to use a joint some Matrix

748
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,739
like using networking information

749
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:19,440
compute information in real time in a

750
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,960
real-time mode and also to us through

751
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,119
some effect here in some effective ways

752
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,418
so with that one here I will give some a

753
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,060
gap analysis this is based on some

754
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,418
existing Solutions so basically like

755
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,859
okay so

756
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,960
um let's look at some existing solutions

757
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,500
to see whether uh they have at least the

758
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,280
partially addressed but my still exists

759
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,399
some deficiencies

760
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,699
next one yeah before I delve into the

761
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,679
details and the categories into

762
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,680
different uh existing Solutions here I

763
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,920
give a slide to do a pre-summary about

764
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,300
the things uh here I give the examples

765
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,460
uh one um some categories not just well

766
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,619
you can assign that as a categorize

767
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,680
example like the DNS like a low balance

768
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,220
like battle like a client base more

769
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,720
because some people keep mentioning

770
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,880
about application how application can do

771
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,920
this can do that and the Paul is the

772
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,079
best so I will put that also in one

773
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,900
category so but if you look at all the

774
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,320
things there is some common uh

775
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,740
commonality to those existing Solutions

776
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,960
about the exposure and the usage of

777
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,820
networking conditions

778
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,000
and but the thing is if you put the you

779
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,099
know uh this thing together wake up in

780
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,200
like interaction approach while later

781
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,500
you you're going to say okay we call our

782
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,420
um it's not solution but the cancer is

783
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,480
like on path was the indirection means

784
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,940
there are some uh pretty intelligent

785
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,180
work that have to uh have to be done in

786
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,240
order for the successive work to uh

787
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,800
proceed

788
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,680
and also uh for all the existing

789
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,560
Solutions I'm going to present next

790
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,000
I I will uh I've concluded them

791
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,460
lack of the integration of the Computing

792
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,099
resource conditions and the networking

793
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,540
conditions together

794
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,359
so uh with those things well here I just

795
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,760
give some implication about something we

796
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,560
want to achieve by the existing

797
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,140
Solutions are lacking off like a

798
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,780
dynamics of service relations

799
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,900
expolder of holistic metrics and also

800
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,839
efficiency and complexity to reduce

801
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,240
complex of costs

802
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,960
next one please yeah this is the first

803
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,240
category about the um called the DNS

804
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,420
another is the globe service a load

805
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,359
balance so for this category um there is

806
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,060
uh the first one is uh the point is that

807
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,440
early bending

808
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,960
the client has to resolve IP address

809
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,820
first let me move from it here okay uh

810
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,859
the client has to resolve IP address

811
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,099
first and then only after that well the

812
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,960
client got a chance to uh send the

813
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,260
traffic so here well remember they also

814
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,500
use some uh some effect effective way

815
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,160
and also to get some real-time uh um

816
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,040
property or characteristic so this one

817
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,700
is uh it's not the ideal for this case

818
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,760
and and also uh remember here we call

819
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,880
the interaction the DNS uh things it's a

820
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,359
resolver again as the well well not not

821
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,839
on the traffic apart so it's uh it's

822
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,079
going to cause the message signaling uh

823
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,660
the signaling burden and also message

824
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,540
distribution all kind of things in order

825
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,359
to remember here it's not just like uh

826
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,440
the the time granularity is uh very uh

827
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,359
very uh small so uh for our objective

828
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,599
and also more some health check for the

829
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,480
for the service instances has has to be

830
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,780
done so this is also a deficiency for

831
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,820
this type of things

832
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,220
um there's like a load balance through

833
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,280
the DNS work like the Guardians SD

834
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,079
multicast DNS we do uh gives uh credits

835
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,079
for the for both but we concluded them

836
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,380
all on the line in the land environment

837
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,079
well here while we are looking at one

838
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,440
scenario so there's also got the DNS

839
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,900
still cache these things this is the

840
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,940
first category about existing solution

841
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,800
next please

842
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,680
the next one is about a loading balancer

843
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,720
it got like no matter like layers really

844
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,240
or four layer 7 and all kinds of things

845
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,540
and we categorize we put them into two

846
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,940
buckets the left one is the single load

847
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,099
balance in a single side for all the

848
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,380
silver instances and the right figure

849
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,579
give the the mod load balancers

850
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,260
distributed or geographically

851
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,900
distributed among different Edge sites

852
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,839
for they they do have a prongs like a uh

853
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,820
either uh they are either they are

854
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,400
easier to deploy to be deployed but they

855
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,380
do have accounts for the left for the

856
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,680
single uh lb case and then you can uh

857
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,540
once one thing in a single point of

858
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,480
failure of the other part like called a

859
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,000
pass stretch like you put out the load

860
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,119
balancer at one Edge site where you may

861
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,579
have service instance on the other well

862
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,520
under the server side or other sites so

863
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,260
that's why if you look at the left

864
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,920
picture you've got a red dotted path for

865
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,720
the uh for the for the right picture

866
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,599
it's the mate a load balancer case and

867
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,339
then the thing here you get the orange

868
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,160
the red and the green so they have to

869
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,760
guide some way to do this type of uh the

870
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,040
distribution of the load out while the

871
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,680
the optimal we keep calling the optimal

872
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,380
uh service instance but here is like

873
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,839
okay for all the three different lbs

874
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,260
they have to find some way to exchange a

875
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,140
message to uh go through some signaling

876
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,800
protocols in order to um achieve the the

877
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,040
target next one

878
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,859
yes this is the third category about the

879
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:23,760
auto

880
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
it's an application layer traffic

881
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,920
optimization so this is called The Off

882
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,680
pass so for the client in order for

883
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,020
client to get the best the optimal

884
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,599
service instance it has to ask a

885
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,380
scheduler which uh Alto server the

886
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,839
server will do all kind of intelligent

887
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:47,339
work uh uh to do the the task to collect

888
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:50,880
information from the uh the end and the

889
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,760
service instances from different Edge

890
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,660
sites okay so here is going to involve

891
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,200
uh remember for the takeaway the second

892
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,200
part we want to get an effective and

893
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,500
effective and efficient way in in a

894
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,560
real-time mode so that is important part

895
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,380
for the article is like the off pass so

896
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,140
it's still

897
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,780
it still Bears the uh the deficiency of

898
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,040
two beers uh something uh we uh our can

899
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,800
are targeting for is targeting for next

900
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,940
one please

901
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,400
uh this is the last one or client-based

902
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,820
solution as people uh here will got some

903
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,520
questions on the application part uh you

904
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,500
can consider it's like the the client

905
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,260
side is a sort of like application but

906
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,000
the thing here is like you ask the

907
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,640
client to do all kind of intelligent

908
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,420
work so it has to find some way to

909
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,300
um to get the real-time information and

910
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,400
so that the client can do the the

911
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,820
selection of course they are a lot of

912
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,060
challenges here so the things like

913
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,220
um the first one actually well we will

914
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,040
consider is the most important as the

915
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,839
largest mobile operator actually this

916
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,060
comment for all the service providers

917
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,320
like you do not want to expose your

918
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,119
domain of some confidential information

919
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,200
about a third party uh you is well maybe

920
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,960
you can argue the UE has already

921
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,740
subscribed to our Network to subscribe

922
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,880
to our service

923
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,160
but the thing here is like there are

924
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,200
some roaming the scenes like okay you

925
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,599
know there are confidential information

926
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,420
and this is a very valuable asset for us

927
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,140
so that event cannot be exposed and the

928
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,140
other thing is like there are so many

929
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,599
applications or Services you do not want

930
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,599
the client itself to do the the work so

931
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,140
it's a remember here uh our can is not

932
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,140
that specific to any particular service

933
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,140
it's just to try to give a kind of the

934
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,300
framework or architecture those type of

935
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,859
things to solve uh the two takeaways in

936
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,200
the previous slide and the previous line

937
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,819
has laid out

938
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,579
okay the next one please

939
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,720
okay so here I'm here now I have uh when

940
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,480
I have gone through four different

941
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,760
categories of existing Solutions the

942
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,099
first one is like a DNS based that the

943
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,240
second one

944
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,119
is a load balancer based the third one

945
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,579
is the auto you can conduct applications

946
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,099
sort of things and uh and the fourth one

947
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,520
at the client and also consider a sort

948
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,520
of including both applications and some

949
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,819
other ways so here uh for the the

950
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,300
existing uh solution until now uh we are

951
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,940
considered okay well they partially they

952
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,280
partially at least I will acknowledge

953
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,819
they have they do they do uh address

954
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:57,000
partially uh the problem scope we have

955
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,520
laid out here but when you put all the

956
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,819
uh all the objectives together so like

957
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,960
uh Dynamics like efficiency like uh

958
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,579
complex the challenge of complexity and

959
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,280
accuracy as well as the Matrix exposure

960
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,160
and usage so when you put everything

961
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,920
together here and they are more or less

962
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,020
for each different categories you can

963
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,319
see the Gap analysis you can see the the

964
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,640
Gap the Gap does exist in different uh

965
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,180
in different existing Solutions

966
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,240
or okay the next one

967
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,720
yeah so with all things here I'm going

968
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,420
to lay out some requirement for the can

969
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,800
next

970
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,359
uh yeah the uh this is the goal we want

971
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,720
to achieve the the thing is like okay so

972
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,599
remember uh in the Pro in the previous

973
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,780
use the case and prompt scope uh slide

974
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,359
well layout okay we want to find the

975
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,880
optimal one so the first goal is to

976
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,660
consider to access one of many possible

977
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,839
instances deployed across multiple sites

978
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:08,960
the second one is

979
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,720
high and Matrix so it's going to jointly

980
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,940
consider both the networking and the

981
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,940
Computing resource status the the third

982
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,480
one is regarding the dynamic decisions

983
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,980
select the appropriate Computing

984
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,280
resource dynamically so this is the

985
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,099
three goals and we want to do we want to

986
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,800
achieve and then can you go to the next

987
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,780
slide

988
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,940
okay a graph I think I'm going to answer

989
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,560
the question but never I think I have a

990
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,280
2003 model so yeah so this is the the

991
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,619
five bullies here with some sub bullets

992
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,720
are the potential main requirements

993
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,480
we're going to uh we we are laying out

994
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,599
here for the camp so the first oh you

995
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,400
know is to support uh access to

996
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,880
available website dynamically and and

997
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,940
then the next one will uh to jointly uh

998
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,700
provide consider the network computing

999
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,339
metrics the third one is the to support

1000
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:07,020
Effective computing resource

1001
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,240
representation and in cap you can

1002
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,119
consider like a message signaling and uh

1003
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,119
some protocol extensions well well I'm

1004
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,460
not talking about solution here but this

1005
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,440
is some sort of like a signaling since

1006
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,300
in mind here

1007
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,700
and also we want to support the session

1008
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,740
continuity and the service continuity

1009
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,480
are called SSC here and if uh for the uh

1010
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,200
for the can and if you we want to uh uh

1011
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,540
to select the best or optimal service

1012
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,740
instance for some ndis uh with the uh

1013
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,859
with the uh prop uh with the service

1014
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,260
with the offering like the the roaming

1015
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,020
service and then here will SSC service

1016
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,119
continuity and the standard and the

1017
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,920
session continuity will be very uh

1018
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,280
critical so uh this one is also in one

1019
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,400
uh in as one of the requirements the

1020
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,560
last one I have uh I have to talk about

1021
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,200
in the client-based solution and then

1022
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,040
the provider want to uh product uh the

1023
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,099
confidentiality about the the you can

1024
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,800
call the other service or the valuable

1025
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,980
assets all kind of things next one

1026
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,060
please

1027
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,480
okay so here is some questions that have

1028
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,900
been asked uh through the the the past

1029
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,319
the boss the same meetings the email

1030
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,200
discussion from the diecast email

1031
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,420
discussion can discussions and all kinds

1032
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,700
of uh the things here I'm not going to

1033
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,540
uh go through the the details but it is

1034
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,000
showing okay people uh there are there

1035
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,680
are a kind of questions that have been

1036
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,040
asked and next one I think that's gonna

1037
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,859
be the last okay this is the uh the

1038
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,060
slide

1039
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,960
okay that is showing some people uh who

1040
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,500
have contributed who have commented or

1041
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,800
who have worked one way or the other on

1042
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,460
the can so by this moment combine this

1043
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,280
the two presentations the punks Lewis

1044
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,740
and the mind here unless the way below

1045
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,780
we can enter uh some questions the first

1046
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,420
question is is there a problem yes the

1047
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,720
problem scope clear yes they are from

1048
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,960
this slide is the um uh is there a

1049
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,380
massive a critical mass of participate

1050
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,680
participants who have showed interest

1051
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,319
one way or the other yes and then is

1052
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:34,680
there a space in its for this can to

1053
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,980
form a group yes so the next will be the

1054
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,440
charter discussion from

1055
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,380
thank you thank you now we go to the

1056
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,660
questions and first one on the Queue is

1057
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,440
Tom Hill please uh State your

1058
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,800
affiliation I will thank you very much

1059
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,640
um

1060
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,220
I'm Tom Hill from BT

1061
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,440
um I'm very interested in VR I think

1062
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,000
it's actually really cool I everyone

1063
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,920
wants a good VR experience so I can

1064
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,140
entirely understand

1065
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,060
why we need to Signal information about

1066
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,280
good processing uh good you know

1067
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,500
abundance of processing resources on the

1068
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,839
network cool completely understand that

1069
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,720
um

1070
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,599
if we are going to Signal metal metadata

1071
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,599
or meta information about resources on

1072
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,480
the network we can do this in a few ways

1073
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,000
we can do this inbound we can do this

1074
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,300
outer band or we cannot do it at all

1075
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,520
in theory you could just you know have

1076
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,140
too much capacity and it won't be very

1077
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,119
efficient

1078
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,160
it strikes me as very strange though

1079
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,740
when we're being asked not to discuss

1080
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,920
solutions that this is being

1081
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,020
formed in the routing working group it

1082
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,420
seems particularly ominous

1083
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,540
but also if this is going to be a

1084
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,000
routing based solution how do we

1085
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,720
actually inform handsets such that the

1086
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,760
applications know

1087
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,319
what to do

1088
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,240
because

1089
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,440
there's a disconnect there between

1090
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,020
having multiple applications for VR or

1091
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,400
ar and a network understanding that this

1092
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,839
company's Computing resource is

1093
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,280
different to this company's Computing

1094
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,619
resources okay I I think you asked a

1095
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,500
question about how the network uh in our

1096
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,319
scenario should inform the

1097
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,660
UE or end devices about this intelligent

1098
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,040
is that right

1099
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,920
yeah okay it doesn't it doesn't seem

1100
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,900
like it's a rooting solution as such it

1101
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,980
seems to be something that's an

1102
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,540
out-of-bound signal you know the things

1103
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,579
like I can answer your question here for

1104
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:38,760
us the mobile uh operator here there are

1105
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,800
a different ways to do the work but the

1106
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,960
first part is still is like under

1107
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,540
looting domain we have to jointly use

1108
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,119
the you know uh we proposed Computing

1109
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:51,660
and uh networking metrics to do the

1110
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,180
first level of the work only after that

1111
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,720
uh well in the mobile space you know I

1112
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,260
can I can say like the 3gpp uh 5G they

1113
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,000
have a defined we can call the urfp

1114
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,220
those type of things that is some rule

1115
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,140
they are going to apply at the UE side

1116
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,660
the things like you may people may argue

1117
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,180
about the ursp say okay this is like a

1118
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,859
pre-configured rule at the UE it's not

1119
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:17,160
dynamic or it's configured by the uh by

1120
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,920
the PCF it's not the damage either but

1121
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,200
there is some certain ways like in the

1122
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,720
edge Computing like uh and the do is

1123
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,240
mentioned for the in the Computing the

1124
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,180
the domain there's another called AF

1125
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,700
guidance so basically it does have some

1126
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,819
sort of intelligence and if AF can

1127
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:40,140
provide intelligence to uh aware an EF

1128
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,500
and to a PCF and then to the UE for this

1129
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,480
type of although it's not the complete

1130
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,819
the real time but it does have something

1131
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:51,000
uh like that but since for AF guidance

1132
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,819
here you know us ASP costs uh you know

1133
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,220
for the mobile operator normally they're

1134
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,660
going to provide the service it's also

1135
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,119
like a ASP or maybe contract with some

1136
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,660
third party AFP so this the cad that

1137
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,119
actually is the good very good point

1138
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:08,460
internet okay those information has to

1139
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,460
be collected there's something has to be

1140
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,559
collected and then do some intelligent

1141
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,980
and go through the AF the af12 the the

1142
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,220
the 5G system and strategy system tell

1143
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,099
the UE so the hosting well will connect

1144
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,819
together so this is all and 5G this

1145
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:28,319
isn't aimed in any way at fixed line

1146
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,020
Broadband right but the thing here you

1147
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,960
mentioned okay you're going to kill the

1148
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,119
UE or kill some other device about the

1149
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,460
things no matter what something some

1150
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,500
intelligent things you have to get first

1151
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,740
yeah okay and then you are but the hotel

1152
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,020
okay you're not you're not going to ask

1153
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,780
the internet device or you eat okay can

1154
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,960
you do yourself purely no it's not it

1155
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,599
cannot do it remember the decline based

1156
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:57,020
solution we have analyzed

1157
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,880
we have so many people on the line and

1158
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,559
maybe you can reserve your discussion to

1159
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,619
the Charter so sorry for that

1160
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,740
um next one's Greg yes thank you uh Greg

1161
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,180
Ericsson

1162
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,880
um actually interesting uh I think I

1163
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,040
changed my question standing here and

1164
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,319
listening to your discussion uh because

1165
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,140
originally what I was about to ask is

1166
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,640
the balance

1167
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,420
um so what you include in the term of

1168
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,460
continuity of the service

1169
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,119
uh because on one hand you say that you

1170
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,780
want to update information using Dynamic

1171
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,559
uh data and that brings concern about

1172
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,800
the stability of your system

1173
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,140
um okay so that's the question about

1174
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,260
whether you consider that continuity

1175
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,619
includes their stability of your domain

1176
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:52,500
uh in second but second I think it's a

1177
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,619
larger one continuing uh uh the previous

1178
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,839
discussion is

1179
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,480
uh

1180
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,480
it appears that uh the scope of this

1181
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,280
work is not ITF specific it's more for

1182
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,160
free gpp

1183
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,460
and uh when we started discussion of uh

1184
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,700
transport Network's license in ITF we

1185
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,180
clearly identify the scope of this work

1186
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,960
so I had three gpp asked ITF to work on

1187
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,460
this

1188
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,160
thank you okay the the fourth question

1189
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,520
uh regarding about the the SSC service

1190
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,859
at the session continuity here that

1191
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:37,140
seems like it's uh we just used the

1192
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,800
zooming as one example since the the UE

1193
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,619
drawing will be very common case it then

1194
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,559
it doesn't matter it's a 5G or 4G or

1195
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,920
even a model 3D Park so the thing is

1196
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,420
here the uh we want to get some uh

1197
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:57,059
service Affinity so it's like we always

1198
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:00,359
want to get the same in-service instance

1199
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:03,180
that is going to offer the service for

1200
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,780
the other devices for the device if if

1201
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,420
you talk about the SSC particular for 5G

1202
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,740
you think you mentioned about it for the

1203
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,740
mobile device here it has defined three

1204
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,040
different SSC like I say one two three

1205
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,500
and they're going to have a make make

1206
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,200
before a break or make after break those

1207
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,500
type of things so but the things like if

1208
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,319
you use the different SSD mode and then

1209
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,099
you can still use like the PS uh PSA ups

1210
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,559
and then those type of things but no

1211
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,300
matter what they're going to voice down

1212
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,300
your second question this is not 3gpp

1213
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,599
work remember I keep saying okay that is

1214
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,880
just the one example so we are still

1215
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,280
going to collect information from Beyond

1216
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,280
your n6 interface and that will be on

1217
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,920
the DNN so that is still going to

1218
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,260
include the collection of information

1219
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,020
the singling of the message and then

1220
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,240
some intelligent that has that has to be

1221
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,700
applied as the networking node only

1222
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,980
after that we'll be able to consider the

1223
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,000
use case in which 5G of 3gp can be one

1224
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,300
thank you uh let me cut in one second

1225
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,500
change uh there is the uh

1226
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,020
a charter presentation and then we have

1227
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,380
the okay open the open discussion so you

1228
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,420
want but you can see here you want to

1229
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,140
maybe you want to control how much time

1230
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,140
you you spend on answering questions or

1231
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,119
comments or maybe say that bring some

1232
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,099
discussion off an hour to later

1233
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:38,160
discussion just a reminder I think uh uh

1234
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,079
let's go to the charters in the charter

1235
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,200
also going to uh explain something about

1236
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,500
like the uh the problems goal objective

1237
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,319
background and then the timeline of

1238
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:50,819
those things and then after that we

1239
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:52,800
still have a sufficient time for open

1240
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,980
discussions okay so the next one is

1241
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,280
chenley okay I will make it very uh

1242
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,160
quick actually from Holly I do see the

1243
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,040
value of the Gap analysis different

1244
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,160
solutions have different value and we do

1245
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,800
see the the value of the Gap analysis

1246
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,280
and by the way we have uh uh answer

1247
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,640
again again the similar questions uh

1248
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,400
race today no matter in the checkbox or

1249
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,640
here right so I I encourage people to

1250
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,559
read the draft and then go back again

1251
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:28,260
because it's really hard to explain in

1252
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,180
the short term it waste a lot of time

1253
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,359
for us right thank you okay thank you

1254
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,300
okay so next one is uh Daniel Daniel

1255
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,839
Huang

1256
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,119
so sorry to interrupt

1257
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:43,740
um okay

1258
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,400
I think that you yeah do you do you want

1259
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,260
to make these I mean there are people in

1260
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,660
the queue but I guess I'm gonna request

1261
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,520
that people take themselves out of the

1262
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,140
queue if they have a general comment and

1263
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,960
leave themselves in the queue if they

1264
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,300
have a clarification question about what

1265
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,839
you just presented and everything else

1266
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:05,339
okay now like Jeffrey said there's going

1267
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:08,339
to be a charter discussion and a general

1268
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:11,220
discussion sure let's go to the the

1269
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,380
charter part about that that would be

1270
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,660
more important yeah we are going to have

1271
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,240
a sufficient time after that thank you

1272
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,040
okay so

1273
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,740
um is Daniel still there to ask

1274
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,040
questions

1275
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,420
and Dirk as well

1276
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,480
yeah yeah

1277
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,359
the general one from ZTE I'm I'm trying

1278
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,880
to be quick and uh when we're talking

1279
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,579
about the off path Solutions like TNG

1280
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:42,299
are presenting in the drafts and it

1281
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:45,420
seems to me it it makes sense it why

1282
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,660
it's why it makes sense to maintain the

1283
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,180
Computing relative resources in the

1284
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,119
concentrate the centered data centers

1285
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,260
and to make it they concentrated a data

1286
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,700
center to make the uh service distance

1287
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,819
to selection decisions but when it comes

1288
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:08,819
to the uh cilarious the world the

1289
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:11,520
Computer Resources has been distributed

1290
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,559
then written and located in a multiple

1291
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:16,619
and the locations in the quite

1292
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,040
ubiquitous way and it seems to me it

1293
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,000
will be more better and reasonable to uh

1294
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,780
to to to to to to to to upload the the

1295
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,079
the decision processed into the routing

1296
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:33,480
and protocols and routing systems

1297
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,760
thank you thank you

1298
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,339
okay so Dirk do you still have something

1299
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:40,619
yeah the clarification uh Dr Austin

1300
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,700
Huawei

1301
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,280
um I can also encourage before please

1302
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,480
read the reference that we have

1303
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,180
references on a question regarding uh

1304
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,339
that Tom asked about what needs to be

1305
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:52,799
signaled um by references to works that

1306
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,359
have shown that signaling very minimal

1307
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:55,980
information and not semantic Rich

1308
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,900
information can give you significant

1309
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,520
performance benefits we have a site

1310
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,920
meeting tomorrow on Wednesday

1311
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,359
um showing some work that's reference in

1312
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,520
the Gap analysis craft and how you use

1313
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,760
the same algorithm layer 7 or layer 3

1314
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,200
and what are the differences so it

1315
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,520
answer some of the questions in the Gap

1316
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,619
analysis if you do even compute

1317
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,420
awareness and you do it at layer seven

1318
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,460
what's the performance benefit or the

1319
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,319
performance penalty compared to if you

1320
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:21,720
do it a lower level there's there's it's

1321
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,280
discussed in one of the site meetings so

1322
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,720
encourage people to read these things

1323
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,420
because they do answer to large extent

1324
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,480
of questions thank you thank you so

1325
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,640
should we go to the next one on agenda

1326
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,000
for the group Charter discussion

1327
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,400
um before the charter discussion one

1328
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,859
clarification I want to make here

1329
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:44,339
so indeed the people some people believe

1330
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:47,040
that there is solution outside routing

1331
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,680
and indeed we're not going to talk about

1332
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,740
Solutions here in this path but indeed

1333
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,500
this path is focused on the routing side

1334
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,079
so that that's what what you're going to

1335
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,440
see in charter is about the routing

1336
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,040
aspects

1337
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,839
um

1338
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,680
why

1339
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,480
okay it's the scope and the charter

1340
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,420
statement for okay

1341
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,660
so here just to clarify our very

1342
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,299
important issues that uh is about

1343
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:34,859
Ingress

1344
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:38,099
Solutions not not to put everything in

1345
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:40,559
the underlying loading system

1346
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,819
so the can working group is a home to

1347
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:47,420
discuss how Computing related results

1348
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,400
including buds not limited to Computing

1349
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,819
and storage capabilities may impact the

1350
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:56,520
loading system therefore new mechanisms

1351
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,380
and

1352
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,000
protocol extensions may need to be

1353
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,640
developed to adjust the requirement and

1354
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,400
then find in the WG it's overall about

1355
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,940
the can WG and next is about the

1356
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,579
background and the motivations and some

1357
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:15,240
brief use cases here so most modern

1358
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,480
service create multiple service instance

1359
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,819
that are often geographically

1360
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:24,359
distributed in multi-stites including

1361
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:27,660
on-premise or cloud data centers to

1362
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,640
scale up the service offering for

1363
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,880
improving performance as any of those

1364
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,420
sites can serve a service the Computing

1365
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,599
related conditions at those sites are

1366
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,359
just as important as Network conditions

1367
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:45,720
drive by floating protocols and traffic

1368
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,900
engineering for the service performance

1369
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,299
this is especially true in Azure

1370
01:02:51,299 --> 01:02:53,460
Computing environment when supporting

1371
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,220
service such as VR and AR and the

1372
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,839
intelligence transportation

1373
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,440
whose traffic may need careful steering

1374
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,500
due to latency bandwidth required

1375
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,480
convenient results sensitivity and

1376
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,760
mobility and therefore join the

1377
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,619
conservation of network and convenience

1378
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,220
status is needed for runtime traffic

1379
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,900
steering among multiple exercise as well

1380
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,960
as potential surveys deploy deployment

1381
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,000
and Resource Management to meet the

1382
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,920
demand for optimal user experience

1383
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,879
next slides please

1384
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,799
um so there are existing solutions that

1385
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:34,319
utilize and points results information

1386
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,619
for selecting those server instance such

1387
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:41,160
as DNS Auto or layer 4 and the layer 7

1388
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,200
load balancers coming to all those

1389
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,200
Solutions is exposure and usage of

1390
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,799
Network conditions for decision making

1391
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:51,839
while none of the existing Solutions

1392
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,700
integrates the Computing results

1393
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,460
conditions with the network condition

1394
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,780
for deciding on the optimal pass here I

1395
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,980
want to emphasize that uh some people go

1396
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,920
early into the solutions discussion so

1397
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,380
please to to think more about the curve

1398
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,780
analysis parts to fight cans uh uh you

1399
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:20,160
use case and it's Delirious so allows

1400
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,220
Ingress nodes to consider Computing

1401
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,079
related results conditions including

1402
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:27,720
decisions as such they can WG May

1403
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,480
develop an informational document or

1404
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,940
create a design thing to Define use case

1405
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,799
government analysis requirement

1406
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,839
character

1407
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,000
ization of the Computing relative

1408
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,940
results and how those conditions impact

1409
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,520
the Ingress nodes loading decision

1410
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,079
process

1411
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,400
the fighting will enables the can WG

1412
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,140
participants to also study the

1413
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,420
suitability of existing loading

1414
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,920
Technologies such as bgp further so

1415
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,760
potential for extending

1416
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,740
existing Technologies to Signal

1417
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,339
committing information in addition to

1418
01:05:07,339 --> 01:05:12,020
network conditions will be studied

1419
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,520
and the first time existing Technologies

1420
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,760
such as Auto NETCOM OEM and emerging

1421
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,180
Telemetry proposals will be investigated

1422
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:25,140
as for the purpose for of joint

1423
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,299
Computing Network information collection

1424
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:29,880
and usage so that the thought

1425
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,220
configuration accounting performance

1426
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,280
security requirements may be met

1427
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,500
yeah next please

1428
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,099
so the can W is chartered to work on the

1429
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:42,960
following items

1430
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,079
first the Quran work maybe

1431
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:48,059
documented by a design team or via a set

1432
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:51,599
of informational internet jobs and not

1433
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,180
necessarily for publication as an

1434
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,599
obviously includes a problem statement

1435
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,599
for the needs for considering both

1436
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:04,020
Network and Computing result status

1437
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,900
use cases for using the network and the

1438
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,900
computer cells starters to benefit the

1439
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,480
steering of traffic from applications

1440
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,240
that have a critical SL that would

1441
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:18,119
require the integrated conversions of

1442
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,640
network paths conditions and Computing

1443
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,720
results

1444
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,839
uh requirements for commonly a grade the

1445
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:26,880
company metrics and their distribution

1446
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,619
across the network as well as

1447
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,900
appropriate frequency and the scope of

1448
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,020
distribution and analyze the suitability

1449
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,480
and the usefulness of the Computing and

1450
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,480
network metrics for traffic steering

1451
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,319
decision in can with CAD metrics

1452
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,660
autologic as a possible outcome

1453
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:49,980
and the final of the groundwork is to

1454
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,280
analyze the methods for Distributing the

1455
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,920
necessary information to utilize

1456
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,420
identified metrics in use cases

1457
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,160
and besides the groundwork also has

1458
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:06,000
application applicability of existing

1459
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,720
tours and magnesiums

1460
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,420
analysis of implementing the can control

1461
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,700
and the data plan using existing

1462
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,920
mechanism including identifying the

1463
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,700
limitation of existing tours in

1464
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,180
fulfilling requirements study potential

1465
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,640
new approach for the control and data

1466
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,980
plan solutions that can fill the

1467
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,920
identified gaps of existing tools and

1468
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,220
solutions and studies I say

1469
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:39,420
uh AP and suitability of existing

1470
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,960
message protocols such as Network and

1471
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,500
the data models such as young

1472
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,559
next slides please

1473
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:54,599
so here's uh Milestones uh if the

1474
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:57,720
WJ is chartered and plans to adopt the

1475
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,059
cam problem statement use case graph

1476
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:02,240
analysis under common documents

1477
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:06,960
in John next year July next year yeah

1478
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,240
and then adopt the cam framework and

1479
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,880
architecture document then adopt at

1480
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,180
least one control plan protocol document

1481
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:18,660
and the data plan protocol document if

1482
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:22,859
there is uh I mean if the work refers to

1483
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:24,479
the data plan

1484
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,479
and then Summit the

1485
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:28,319
um

1486
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,198
framework and architecture document for

1487
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,620
publication and adopt the can OEM

1488
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,020
Performance Management yarn protection

1489
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,279
document

1490
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:41,880
and then submit all of them in the in

1491
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,560
the field

1492
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,259
following Maybe

1493
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:48,479
four or five years

1494
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,160
all of this

1495
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,279
it's a current milestones

1496
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,000
yeah it's all about the purple the

1497
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,679
charter statement

1498
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:00,600
and maybe

1499
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,679
um

1500
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,020
now it's open discussion or some okay I

1501
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,640
do want to say a few words before we

1502
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,859
start an open discussion as you can see

1503
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:12,779
there are 22 people on the Queue okay so

1504
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:15,660
um if you have expressed your opinions

1505
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,299
already

1506
01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:20,698
you can save the time for people who

1507
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,219
haven't expressed opinions we want to

1508
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:24,020
hear

1509
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:28,259
diverse opinion from wider uh range of

1510
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:31,738
people to express okay so just keep your

1511
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:32,520
questions

1512
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,580
um short and don't repeat the questions

1513
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,520
that you already asked yeah I'm sorry

1514
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,238
curricular for your suggestion so that

1515
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,979
those who already spoke at the

1516
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:48,019
microphone will be uh

1517
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:51,540
punished for speaking early no it's not

1518
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,339
punished it's just the same questions

1519
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:57,080
okay penalized okay

1520
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,360
just because limited time right uh also

1521
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,239
everybody that's reasonable okay always

1522
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:05,340
um make sure you can send emails express

1523
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,260
your opinions on the mailing list as

1524
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,560
well there's a can at ietf.com so I will

1525
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,260
want to hear more opinions okay

1526
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,480
um so let's go through the list uh first

1527
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,500
one is Tony Lee

1528
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:22,260
hi Tony Lee Juniper Networks

1529
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,360
um right at the start of your Charter

1530
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,520
you made the assumption that you're

1531
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,960
going to fix this in the routing

1532
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,280
subsystem

1533
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,100
and yet I've also already heard that not

1534
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,780
everyone agrees that it needs to be

1535
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,060
fixed in the routing subsystem

1536
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,340
so I think it's a bit premature to

1537
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,840
assume that it's going to be fixed in

1538
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,780
routing and I think the charter should

1539
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,140
be generalized thank you okay thank you

1540
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,000
very much

1541
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,820
um next one's Greg yes

1542
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:54,600
um I have a question so um you uh point

1543
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,679
to Computing and storage capabilities uh

1544
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:01,320
in the terminology of iitf Transport

1545
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,920
Network slicing do you consider to be a

1546
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,620
service level objectives or service

1547
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:11,040
level expectations

1548
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:15,179
motives or service levels

1549
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:18,620
so it's about the network sliding or no

1550
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,980
in your proposal in your Charter so use

1551
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,460
basically recording that uh discuss how

1552
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,679
Computing related resources include but

1553
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:30,239
not limited to Computing and storage

1554
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:33,360
capabilities impact welding system yeah

1555
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,620
so these capabilities or requirements

1556
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,360
that set forth by the service

1557
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,219
uh do you consider them to be a service

1558
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:47,239
level objectives or service level

1559
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:50,460
expectations using the terminology of

1560
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,120
ITF Transportation I got the question in

1561
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,260
fact

1562
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,380
um we have some work to discuss it but

1563
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,560
we don't put the draft here in the book

1564
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,460
because it's not determined I mean uh in

1565
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,500
uh in the trips level service level or

1566
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,420
service level may be uh possible but it

1567
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,980
depends on the the solution prioritizing

1568
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,739
uh I'm lost so do you consider that

1569
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:22,860
these capabilities are measurable or not

1570
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,580
uh yes it's marable uh okay so if it's

1571
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,620
measurable then probably most likely

1572
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,620
it's a service level objectives and then

1573
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:35,699
why uh you believe that they are special

1574
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:39,000
comparing to latency metric geometric

1575
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,219
packet was metrics

1576
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:43,860
so why they don't lock the wrong in the

1577
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,880
framework of ITF

1578
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,640
transport Network slicing okay so

1579
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,800
um okay that's my question okay thank

1580
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,780
you so maybe you guys can think about it

1581
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,580
and answer on the mailing list so

1582
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,440
basically they're saying why it's not

1583
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,900
integrated

1584
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,199
the general and other delayed attributes

1585
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:07,320
so yeah okay so Greg also make sure you

1586
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,140
record your question on the notes so for

1587
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,640
them to you don't have to speak to say

1588
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,820
because I I promise I will look up the

1589
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,640
units and uh I will um you can do it now

1590
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,460
yeah you can put in your prices clearly

1591
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,600
right

1592
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,100
um because quite a few people are

1593
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,659
non-native speakers sometimes they

1594
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:26,520
cannot react very quickly or click

1595
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,280
listen clearly of the questions okay

1596
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,020
next one is Shara

1597
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:35,280
yes hi

1598
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,159
um thank you for the presentations

1599
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:38,820
um

1600
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,520
I actually agree with a lot with what

1601
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,239
was presented uh the challenges are real

1602
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:48,300
and concrete right now and also it's uh

1603
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,219
not just a challenge it's an opportunity

1604
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:54,719
because uh the geo-distributed compute

1605
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,040
resources

1606
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,739
uh increase the capacity significantly

1607
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:00,360
reduce the cost

1608
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,820
and they're not equivalent because

1609
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,040
they're geo-distributed they cannot

1610
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,500
share a microsecond database so they are

1611
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,780
not the same

1612
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:13,560
um so because of the applications and

1613
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,020
the changing loads and because of the

1614
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,080
Geo distributions Services actually may

1615
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,860
show up behind any PE in any of these

1616
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,340
locations and we've seen that and also

1617
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,040
clients will show up behind any IP

1618
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,840
anchor because of breakout and cost

1619
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,360
reduction and private 5G and Wi-Fi and

1620
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,260
also

1621
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,100
and I also agree with what was said with

1622
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,080
The Gap analysis load balancers they're

1623
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,300
not a solution because they assume some

1624
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,040
concentration and we don't want to

1625
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,260
concentrate

1626
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:48,960
DNS is a big caching issue in the client

1627
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,020
and the resolution break service and any

1628
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,780
client-based solution will aggravate any

1629
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,120
coherency challenge that we still have

1630
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,820
if we solve a network

1631
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:02,820
but not to the same extent not for

1632
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:07,400
Millions it will be reduced to doesn't

1633
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,800
but the problem even though we're only

1634
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,320
discussing the problem you can State the

1635
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,620
problem such that we need routing in

1636
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,460
network

1637
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,159
to be able to handle the fact

1638
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,460
that clients

1639
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,020
can show up with the same identity

1640
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,500
behind any PE and so do Services they

1641
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,320
can show up with their identity behind

1642
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,880
one PE and then in the next meeting

1643
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,100
behind another p

1644
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,620
so

1645
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,900
if the problem is stated that way the

1646
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,540
Gap analysis should also consider the

1647
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:46,199
routing that allows it today so it's

1648
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:48,420
missing

1649
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,980
thank you

1650
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,719
okay thank you

1651
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,300
um

1652
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,340
yeah I want to cut him for one second

1653
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,280
again please you're if you're in the

1654
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,000
room use down on-site tool for three

1655
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,179
things Blue Shield sign in join the

1656
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:09,300
queue and then at the end end we may do

1657
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,480
a a show of hands Paul so if you want

1658
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,520
your voice to be heard please use the

1659
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,179
online tool

1660
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,900
the tool didn't like me so he basically

1661
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,000
put his hand up for me so that's why I'm

1662
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,239
in the cube now so I have a question so

1663
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,940
so far in the all the use cases we draw

1664
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:35,580
basically a set of computes

1665
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,800
and one network

1666
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,260
is the scope of what you're trying to do

1667
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,440
limited to a single operator Network and

1668
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,199
single com a single owner or operational

1669
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,300
guy that owns a compute or is the

1670
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,580
solution focused on the fact that I can

1671
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,920
have multiple operators owning the

1672
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,900
compute and different operators not

1673
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,140
limited to one uh owning the networking

1674
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,440
side is that in scope or not well well

1675
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,840
thanks uh first we focus on the use case

1676
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,960
that the both of the network and the

1677
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,719
committing results May belong to the

1678
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:13,260
same undertale that is uh simple because

1679
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,780
I think okay because because in my view

1680
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,640
if you look to the problem space today

1681
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,540
yeah it's I constraining it to that is

1682
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,800
not practical

1683
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,560
because if I'm a user of an app

1684
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,900
I will use multiple Network operators

1685
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,940
and I will use multiple computes and I

1686
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,219
think that's the space that we have to

1687
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:34,020
solve this problem and then if you look

1688
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,940
at that routing is the wrong space

1689
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,560
yeah and I think that's how I look I'm

1690
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,000
not saying that the problem doesn't

1691
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,060
exist but if you look to the elements

1692
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,640
that are involved and that that have to

1693
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,140
deliver the service

1694
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,960
you cannot constrain this to a limited a

1695
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,820
single Network operator and a single

1696
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:55,920
owner of the compute we have to think

1697
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,679
about this much more broader

1698
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,900
yeah yeah thanks in fact we don't

1699
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,280
include

1700
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,080
okay

1701
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,400
so next one is

1702
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,219
like a person uh personally I don't

1703
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,560
agree with that we should do or walk

1704
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,840
from like multiple operators that will

1705
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,520
make make the things very complicated

1706
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,860
right so let's start with a single

1707
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,679
operator a very easy starting point yeah

1708
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:27,239
so uh I agree with the charter of the

1709
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,760
use cases and then and and and the work

1710
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,360
items because it clearly describe what

1711
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,540
we should do in the potential working

1712
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,960
group right so uh thank you for the work

1713
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,480
and and by the way I need to mention

1714
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,120
this like in this book we're following

1715
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,520
the the instruction that we should not

1716
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,040
discuss the solution related topic

1717
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,659
because there will be an endless

1718
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:53,880
discussion so we wouldn't get nothing

1719
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,120
today so so let's focus on the use case

1720
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,000
thank you thank you so next one on the

1721
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,020
list is Dirk Charleston hi um Dirk from

1722
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,400
uh Huawei again

1723
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,840
um and I wanted to be sure because I was

1724
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,040
already in the microphones I'm gonna get

1725
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,560
punished but um I do agree with Shane I

1726
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,060
mean they we put a lot of work in trying

1727
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,940
to make a case but I think um

1728
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,980
then there was not right

1729
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,960
all right good hopefully we note this

1730
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,100
properly that somebody actually

1731
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,600
disguised himself

1732
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,920
um I think you had a good point though

1733
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,360
and this this ought to be part of the

1734
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,860
discussion and maybe some of the use

1735
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,140
cases are too constrained if they are

1736
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,000
only considered in a single domain I

1737
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,679
generally don't agree to that it's

1738
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,600
getting boring but there may be use

1739
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,900
cases where maybe spanning both compute

1740
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,300
service providers and network providers

1741
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,400
may be interesting but again only a good

1742
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,659
discussion on the use case and the

1743
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:45,179
problems will bring that out and and and

1744
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:47,520
and that's for me even more an argument

1745
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,080
to do this working group moving forward

1746
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,719
and work on this um properly so I I

1747
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:53,699
certainly support this thank you

1748
01:19:53,699 --> 01:19:58,020
thank you so next one is tinji

1749
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,239
um here I try to answer the question

1750
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:04,440
um who asked about the use case and uh

1751
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,679
as Paul has uh answered already so far

1752
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,020
we are going to focus on a single uh

1753
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:13,219
domains like uh not going to cross some

1754
01:20:13,219 --> 01:20:15,960
operators but the thing is if you look

1755
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,179
at the work look at the thing we have

1756
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:20,760
led here it's it's not going to prevent

1757
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,420
us or prevent the community from doing

1758
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,060
the cross operator things so that was

1759
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,040
actually about when you talk about cross

1760
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,620
operator it does record the

1761
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,719
standardization actually that is our

1762
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:36,480
objective to make this one standardized

1763
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,000
through a can working group such that

1764
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,460
everyone can work together across the

1765
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,199
readers thank you

1766
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,420
yeah so thank you

1767
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:49,320
um so uh what our closer to because too

1768
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,639
many people so next one is

1769
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,320
he she on the remote okay

1770
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,320
I yes chair and I I think there are many

1771
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,320
ongoing work related to the computer

1772
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,380
network convergence and there are also

1773
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,960
many requirements and we think that the

1774
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,060
uh use cases and also the problem

1775
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,820
statement is clear and it's meaningful

1776
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,120
to working on that and also the charter

1777
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,400
is clear for us and we think that we

1778
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,560
need a home to discuss the related

1779
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,860
issues so a new working group May better

1780
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:30,080
to promote the work thanks

1781
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,219
well thanks

1782
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:38,419
okay next one is

1783
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,719
sure weights

1784
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,380
hello

1785
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,320
yes we can hear you I'm a from Radio

1786
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,140
Networks and there's a scope and the

1787
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:58,679
work items which the child laid out are

1788
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:01,620
very clean to us also very important

1789
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:04,440
these issues has been discussed a lot

1790
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,060
personally in the car under the custom

1791
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,060
mailing list so as you can maybe we need

1792
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:13,199
a working group or to promote the works

1793
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,919
or sex

1794
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:21,860
thank you next one is rolling Wong

1795
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:27,739
rojin right Gene sorry

1796
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,960
well and in my view the chatter makes it

1797
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,080
very clear and the establishment of the

1798
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,140
new working group is of great

1799
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:39,540
significant to the promotion of the

1800
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,000
Computing aware related work and all

1801
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,340
research group is also engaged in

1802
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,580
related research and acting Health lists

1803
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,380
and we are looking forward to the future

1804
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,280
work of care in ietf I support the

1805
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,560
establishment of the new working group

1806
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,400
thank you

1807
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,699
okay next one is

1808
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:06,300
hi uh I I think the use case support

1809
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,500
access to the available

1810
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,980
uh Edge computer dynamically and the

1811
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,739
scenario is valid now I think the

1812
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:21,300
charter is clear so thank you

1813
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,540
okay next one is kitten

1814
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,000
um

1815
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,540
I think there is still not Clarity uh in

1816
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,060
at least in my view uh whether

1817
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:38,400
what is exactly the problem to be solved

1818
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,820
and as a follow-up whether it uh the

1819
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,620
solution is at the routing layer for

1820
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,080
that so things the charter talks about

1821
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,880
things like or seems to talk about

1822
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,820
things like path selection right uh

1823
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,840
using uh some additional metrics perhaps

1824
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,400
for traffic engineering or tunneling

1825
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,699
right uh to the right egress Point uh

1826
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,920
those are all uh probably things to be

1827
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,380
done at the routing layer

1828
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:07,440
uh but then uh the use cases and other

1829
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,360
things and the comparisons give me an

1830
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,760
impression that that's not what this is

1831
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,560
about this is

1832
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,080
more about uh you know a selection of

1833
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,000
the address uh because we are talking

1834
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,159
about load balancers and uh you know

1835
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:23,760
Alto and all those things so I'm to me

1836
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,280
it's not clear that this there is a uh

1837
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:29,040
what the charter is and what uh what the

1838
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,480
problem is going to be solved and

1839
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,040
whether it's appropriate to solve a

1840
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,760
routing layer

1841
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,260
thank you

1842
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,260
um

1843
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,600
I think the use cases of Ken are very

1844
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,540
interesting and indeed makes sense in

1845
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:54,000
delay sensitive scenarios and highly

1846
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,040
Dynamic Network environment

1847
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:59,280
and I think solving these problems by

1848
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,860
modifying layer 3 protocol may be a good

1849
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:05,460
option thank you

1850
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:09,320
thank you next one is

1851
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,480
mm-hmm

1852
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,060
goklin are you on the line you can speak

1853
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,300
now

1854
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:20,699
no

1855
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:24,379
okay the next one is drove

1856
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,980
uh Hydro web uh uh regarding the

1857
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,960
discussion about how to handle

1858
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,780
multi-domain I think we we have to start

1859
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,760
with single domain but we could always

1860
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,320
put this in the charter that whatever

1861
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,659
solution that we come up with should be

1862
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:42,420
able to handle in future multi-domain we

1863
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,520
have done that in the past as well for

1864
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,860
various things and I think we have to

1865
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,780
start small but have a way of like you

1866
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,659
know re-chartering for multi-domain in

1867
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:53,820
future and going back to the original

1868
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:57,120
point from Tony like you know uh can we

1869
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,340
keep the charter of the working group

1870
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,739
without constraining it to routing I

1871
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:02,940
think it's going to be very difficult we

1872
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,159
have gone through those Cycles over and

1873
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,860
over it we need a starting point and we

1874
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,860
need to constrain that because of and we

1875
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:13,199
have to agree based on the Gap analysis

1876
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,780
that's the key whether the uh there is a

1877
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:17,940
consensus that what has been highlighted

1878
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,219
in the Gap analysis and the solutions

1879
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:22,380
which could be Alto based load balancer

1880
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,300
base are not going to meet the

1881
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:27,179
requirements that the proponents of the

1882
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:28,920
buffer making and if we have an

1883
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,020
agreement on that then we can definitely

1884
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,239
say that like no we need a routing based

1885
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:34,980
solution and looking forward to that

1886
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,440
thank you thank you

1887
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,159
so next one is galcon on the line

1888
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:42,960
no

1889
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,050
tree

1890
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:47,220
[Music]

1891
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,320
okay

1892
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,300
on the line

1893
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:59,400
a yes we can hear you technology

1894
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,280
um

1895
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,120
uh I I say in the use case and the list

1896
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,840
chart is clear and I see it will be

1897
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,440
better if a new work group was from to

1898
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:21,019
promote the work thank you

1899
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:26,460
okay so next one is jumping

1900
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:29,000
okay okay

1901
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:32,699
in fact either is IB Shepherd for this

1902
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:35,460
both that's for a long time so regarding

1903
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:38,639
this regarding this Charter and also

1904
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,580
these some of the questions I have this

1905
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:44,699
following comments uh the first one I

1906
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:48,060
think this regarding this Charter about

1907
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:51,000
these use cases in my opinion I think

1908
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,320
that the edge Computing and VR and AR is

1909
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,040
just this example I think maybe in the

1910
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,520
charter country generalized from in my

1911
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,100
opinion I think this is the consensus to

1912
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,460
some extent is to advertise this

1913
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:11,460
Computing information to the network but

1914
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,940
this is the use cases can be uh can be

1915
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:17,820
Beyond this is the arvr and this other

1916
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:20,460
computer because in my opinion for

1917
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,520
example in the isd1 this CPE device

1918
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,820
maybe can also use this information for

1919
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,120
the traffickers during for the sd1 and

1920
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,639
also maybe that's the SLC we can

1921
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,280
according to this Computing informations

1922
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,340
for the service training this is the I

1923
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,800
think this is the past so in my opinion

1924
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,040
but because our this many discussion is

1925
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,440
about always about load balancer and

1926
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,860
about this the Computing AR VR so I

1927
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:53,280
think in order to let's use for our data

1928
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,320
consensus and generalization in my

1929
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,960
opinion I think the use cases of this

1930
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,639
mentioned in the charter should be

1931
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:02,760
generalized this first P first comment

1932
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,460
second one I think this is when Network

1933
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,400
knows so I think in fact the load

1934
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,500
balancer maybe this is a load balance

1935
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,860
this is the original Ip packet but for

1936
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,380
our the network node when we just

1937
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,900
receive this is the packet we may

1938
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,940
encapsulate the tunnels for the

1939
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,000
traffic's Theory so this means the

1940
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,280
network node can take user computing

1941
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,100
informations for the load balancer for

1942
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:33,000
SLC for maybe other sd1 Etc so this is

1943
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,400
why we network node can learn this

1944
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,620
information maybe this is for more

1945
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:40,679
application scenarios this second point

1946
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:43,260
a third point that people talk about

1947
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,600
this application Level or service level

1948
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,260
this is this the Matrix information in

1949
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,020
my opinion so this is just some this is

1950
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,360
the work item we should take into

1951
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,360
account so this is some people this talk

1952
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,580
about this common Matrix these are

1953
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:02,580
Matrix we direct user delay or sum this

1954
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:06,179
or some this is the panels or some this

1955
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:08,699
like this one or we use the application

1956
01:30:08,699 --> 01:30:11,760
Level or service level or directly based

1957
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,820
on the is this level so I think this is

1958
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:17,760
just open I think this way we discussed

1959
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,760
we set up some of these common Matrix so

1960
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,460
this is the third point and this is a

1961
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,440
large point I think this is the scope

1962
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,739
and this is to discussed about in my

1963
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:31,080
opinion this is the other Computing this

1964
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,600
is the typical scenarios as in the cloud

1965
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,780
and this is the cloud and the Computing

1966
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,780
and this network can be controlled by

1967
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:42,840
one of readers but I think this has no

1968
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,480
effect to define the common Matrix so

1969
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,239
from my opinion maybe and also this can

1970
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:51,239
find this scope to this the Computing

1971
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:54,420
and this network in one operators from

1972
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:57,000
this beginning so later maybe think

1973
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,300
about more uh complicated scenarios if

1974
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,540
this uh if this involves these third

1975
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,360
parties so that we must discuss more

1976
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,639
about the security or maybe some other

1977
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:13,560
this the more this work may be done but

1978
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,380
I think the current space I think if we

1979
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,260
consensus to learning this Computing

1980
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:22,199
information and set up this Matrix and I

1981
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:24,600
think this is I think the scope can be

1982
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,179
confined okay that's all

1983
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:30,480
thank you thanks so next one is Daniel

1984
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,219
Wong

1985
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:35,659
is Daniel on the line

1986
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:39,620
no yeah

1987
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,659
I'm from City I'm sorry I'm from City

1988
01:31:42,659 --> 01:31:44,820
the first thing I'd like to make a minor

1989
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:48,420
clarification about the charter

1990
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:51,480
um which is the statement about is the

1991
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,639
exposure to networking resources

1992
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:56,280
actually it occurs to me

1993
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:00,000
um in the industry there's also exposure

1994
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,900
to Computing resources when it comes to

1995
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,560
DNS and grp solutions

1996
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,000
what is absent in the industries

1997
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,760
reaction is the joint optimization of

1998
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,440
the optimization and exposure to

1999
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,560
networking Computing resources and uh

2000
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,760
and again

2001
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,560
um when it comes to the

2002
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,380
um the situation where the Computer

2003
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:25,199
Resources is more and more distributed

2004
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:29,820
in ubiquitous I I strongly believe

2005
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:34,380
um it will it should justify some

2006
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:37,020
capability enhancements in routing

2007
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:40,260
assist systems to make it adaptive to to

2008
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:45,300
the new established Aloma which which in

2009
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:49,139
which the Computer Resources is more and

2010
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:50,880
more is distributed

2011
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,280
thank you

2012
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,460
okay thank you so next one is I drink

2013
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,100
yeah

2014
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,520
I think the the network has been run

2015
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,480
through the Loopers uh status for a long

2016
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,040
time and for item we have event

2017
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:13,080
many tools to improve the network

2018
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,900
performance but in Europe and that

2019
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:18,980
increase application server cannot

2020
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:23,340
cannot fill the fill our effort I think

2021
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:26,880
it is time to open the network and

2022
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,340
incorporate

2023
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:32,120
uh incorporate the hardware information

2024
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,580
to improve the

2025
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:38,639
performance or of the application server

2026
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:42,320
and all the user and your

2027
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:47,100
exported experience okay and uh one

2028
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,340
small command for the uh for the master

2029
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:55,159
would you like to switch to the slide

2030
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,659
I promise

2031
01:34:00,659 --> 01:34:02,820
yeah

2032
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:06,480
most of them yeah okay yeah I noticed

2033
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,760
that the account will

2034
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,560
develop around control plane

2035
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,659
photographer data plane protocol I think

2036
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:14,940
the control plane

2037
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,940
um

2038
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:22,139
working group in the living itf4 so I

2039
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:24,540
think the time should be focused on

2040
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,060
mainly on the framework and architecture

2041
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,860
document okay

2042
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:30,300
thank you

2043
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:33,440
the next one is Dino

2044
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,659
thank you Linda no I'm not you know do

2045
01:34:36,659 --> 01:34:39,179
you know his very nicely offered to let

2046
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:41,460
me use his slot because I put myself on

2047
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:44,100
the Queue right after you closed it I'm

2048
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:46,739
Joel Halpern from Erickson

2049
01:34:46,739 --> 01:34:49,739
so

2050
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,580
I have a couple of different reactions

2051
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:56,699
this Charter needs to be cleaned up

2052
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:58,500
significantly before it can be brought

2053
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,620
forward there is a real problem a real

2054
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:03,540
task a real thing that I think is worth

2055
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,760
working on here

2056
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,440
so if we assume that Ingress devices

2057
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,420
providing tunnels or in caps or whatever

2058
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,880
to get traffic across the network to the

2059
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,920
right server

2060
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,020
is something people want to offer which

2061
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,380
seems sensible and desirable then making

2062
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,000
sure there's a way for servers to

2063
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,699
provide information such that it can get

2064
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:28,860
to those ingresses devices and they can

2065
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:31,440
make choices that use the service

2066
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,540
information and the network information

2067
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:36,120
because it's an Ingress router they see

2068
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,800
the routing already

2069
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,060
that makes sense but when you talk about

2070
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:44,040
injecting the information into the

2071
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,020
routing protocols

2072
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:49,620
I go ballistic because it doesn't make

2073
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:52,139
sense it doesn't work and there's no

2074
01:35:52,139 --> 01:35:55,199
need to mandate a data plane protocol

2075
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:58,020
because that's not what we need to do we

2076
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,060
need to focus on getting the right

2077
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,340
information to the entities that can

2078
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,679
make the decision you've said on the

2079
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:06,179
list and you said when you started the

2080
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:08,400
presentation this is about the Ingress

2081
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,679
devices being able to make the decision

2082
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:13,739
if you write the charter around that I

2083
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:15,120
think we have something we can work with

2084
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,679
we can then figure out what area it

2085
01:36:16,679 --> 01:36:19,980
belongs in I don't care but putting

2086
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,480
saying in the charter we're putting the

2087
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,219
information into the routing system

2088
01:36:23,219 --> 01:36:26,400
gives me serious heartburn thank you

2089
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,659
thank you so next one

2090
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,679
next one

2091
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,400
next one is colon yeah yeah please do

2092
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,860
yeah yeah um I don't uh we we have

2093
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:41,219
discussed this issues and I think it is

2094
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:43,800
the most important issues uh from the

2095
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,900
previous pop that can don't really

2096
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:49,920
expect the whole uh routine system it is

2097
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,159
a focus on the edge agile router and if

2098
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:56,659
the current version of the uh each other

2099
01:36:56,659 --> 01:36:59,179
will lead the

2100
01:36:59,179 --> 01:37:03,000
misunderstood of this this direction we

2101
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,520
can work together to refine it I think

2102
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,940
yeah

2103
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,520
so

2104
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,320
okay so uh Colin Jennings with the IEP

2105
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,300
and John's comments are mostly for you I

2106
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:19,800
think really is you know when I read

2107
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,600
these Milestones this is very much about

2108
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,760
a solution we can't be having this boss

2109
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,199
where we say we're not discussing a

2110
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,060
solution when the charter is very much

2111
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:29,880
about a solution okay so no do not cut

2112
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,920
me off thank you very much

2113
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,480
um and the uh the the issue here is so

2114
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,920
that's part of the issue and the issue

2115
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,179
is lots of people are saying we should

2116
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:40,560
do this application layer and this is

2117
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,300
regularly done at the application major

2118
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,480
sd-wan Solutions major of VoIP Solutions

2119
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:48,420
fine through DNS or other mechanisms a

2120
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,159
variety of endpoints then they contact

2121
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,900
each one of those endpoints major

2122
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:54,120
latency Jitter and stuff to them and

2123
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,800
also at the same time get information

2124
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,900
back about their compute memory

2125
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,580
availability they have of the resources

2126
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,440
they're important so this is a real

2127
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,780
problem no question about that uh but

2128
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,400
there's there's solutions to this that

2129
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,139
may work very well that are done very

2130
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:08,820
much at the applications I don't think

2131
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:10,380
these problem statements have been taken

2132
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:12,060
over to the dispatch or the application

2133
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,460
or art area and discuss there you'd get

2134
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,080
some very interesting feedback on how

2135
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,820
people think we should solve them now

2136
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,620
I'm not I'm not arguing that means we

2137
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,960
shouldn't do something here but we can't

2138
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,600
do something here without discussing the

2139
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,699
architectural issues of the solutions in

2140
01:38:26,699 --> 01:38:28,800
the routing area versus the application

2141
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,320
area and just denying that discussion in

2142
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,000
this boss means we just can't go forward

2143
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,920
with this Charter like this thanks

2144
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,719
thank you so

2145
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:39,900
um maybe the you guys can think about it

2146
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:43,199
and address that okay yeah so next one

2147
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,800
is Dean yes hi Dan so I'm in the very

2148
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,900
strong agreement with Joel and with

2149
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,340
Colin

2150
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:52,500
if we want to set up a working group to

2151
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,060
define the problem

2152
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,880
very happy to do so resource information

2153
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,280
sharing across you know

2154
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:02,580
let's call them I.T systems is something

2155
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:05,280
that would be very nice to solve is it

2156
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,620
the alpha or the L7 layer where to solve

2157
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,840
it is the combination of that

2158
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,120
we don't know there isn't a creole clear

2159
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,580
problem statement what has been

2160
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,320
presented here what has been presented

2161
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,080
in the APN and the closest person to

2162
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,340
come to the problem State and

2163
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:22,860
definitions for Colin and Joel and I

2164
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:24,900
agree with that so

2165
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,940
let's set up a working group to define

2166
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,760
the problem and then to solve it once we

2167
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,380
Define that once we know what we are

2168
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:33,239
what problem you're working on we can

2169
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:35,159
then find the solution right now there's

2170
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:37,020
no problem statement

2171
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,520
okay thank you

2172
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,280
um so next one Paul

2173
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:44,900
uh hello this is uh Paul Jung from

2174
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:48,179
University so I have a three uh comments

2175
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:51,000
the first one is uh can both

2176
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,179
can consider energy consumption looks

2177
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:57,300
like uh basically uh another consumption

2178
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,060
is very important the Viewpoint of

2179
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:03,179
operators right so currently the camp of

2180
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:06,060
uh don't looks like don't consider uh

2181
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,940
energy consumption so that is a command

2182
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:12,780
second one is as another use cases as

2183
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:17,280
you can see Urban Air Mobility like the

2184
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:21,739
prime cars right so the 100

2185
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:23,820
automobiles they are trying to

2186
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:28,139
commercializing by 2018. that is very

2187
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:29,880
important so you mentioned the

2188
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,580
autonomous vehicle in addition to that

2189
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:34,800
also we can see the prime autonomous

2190
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,920
vehicle or something like that that is

2191
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,040
the second uh so in this case is the

2192
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,940
third one is some proactive at the

2193
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:48,719
server assignment considering uh the

2194
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:52,320
users or moving the the trajectory right

2195
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,980
because you can see especially UE or the

2196
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:58,980
car is moving according to a lot of ways

2197
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,920
that we can proactively assign list

2198
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,040
sources in uh for active alert than the

2199
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,600
active way right so that is the one

2200
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,199
thing also users can usually their uh

2201
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:12,480
prefer some the applications the

2202
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,060
application requires some bandages And

2203
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:17,580
Delay so that kind of pro uh Power

2204
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:20,520
information can be taken advantage for

2205
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,699
our camper I think the camp pop is very

2206
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:26,880
important I think thank you thank you

2207
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,580
so next one is tension

2208
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:32,280
tension are you on the line or are you

2209
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,699
in the room

2210
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:36,610
okay

2211
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:37,920
[Music]

2212
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,460
uh I support the charter it is clear and

2213
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:44,040
a good start point to make a further job

2214
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:47,480
about it and thank you

2215
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,820
thank you that's it okay

2216
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:54,320
so next one is Ling Khan

2217
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:01,440
okay hello

2218
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,900
I think the charter is valuable and

2219
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:08,880
clear so I support the channel thank you

2220
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,360
okay so

2221
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,639
um okay so we had closed the queue

2222
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,800
earlier I see uh we still have many

2223
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,280
people in the queue so I think at this

2224
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:21,060
time

2225
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:24,420
we can let uh Jiang or ad decide when he

2226
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,460
wants to catching we can continue the

2227
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:30,600
queue until when Zhang decides that it's

2228
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,300
time to for him to to step in

2229
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:34,800
well it I

2230
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,540
don't have time for monologuing give me

2231
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:39,540
you know five minutes at the end

2232
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,580
um I think you guys had prepared some

2233
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:43,679
questions you wanted to ask so make sure

2234
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:47,159
you leave yourself enough time for those

2235
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:49,739
um but yeah just save me you know five

2236
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:53,380
minutes to close with sure okay

2237
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,239
[Music]

2238
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,239
um

2239
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,040
yeah okay so we are going to uh to the

2240
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,500
poll at certain time

2241
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,679
um so if you are in the room they have

2242
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:06,420
not you signed the on the outside tour

2243
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,239
yet please do so and we will we will do

2244
01:43:09,239 --> 01:43:12,300
the poor uh um like in probably five

2245
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,100
minutes or something like that then

2246
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:16,380
right now we'll just continue the queue

2247
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:19,619
yeah okay okay

2248
01:43:19,619 --> 01:43:23,659
so next one is rain okay

2249
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,560
so for for clarity

2250
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,719
in order to answer the poll you need to

2251
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,639
make sure you've signed in using the QR

2252
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:33,900
code there

2253
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:36,540
and then there's you know once you're

2254
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:39,179
signed in when the chairs start a poll

2255
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:41,219
it'll pop up on your mobile device or

2256
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:44,179
your your laptop

2257
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,320
foreign

2258
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,679
are you

2259
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,199
are you ready to talk

2260
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:06,440
okay

2261
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,219
we also have some solutions with this

2262
01:44:11,219 --> 01:44:12,480
use case

2263
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,820
and I'm waiting to participating in

2264
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:18,179
related works so I suppose the new

2265
01:44:18,179 --> 01:44:21,540
working group yes thanks

2266
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:24,540
foreign

2267
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:42,960
carrier who is also has the public cloud

2268
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,300
service and they have the latency

2269
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,400
requirement on a network in the service

2270
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,920
of Barcelona and I even made this kind

2271
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,980
of case in the public Cloud carriers

2272
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,139
service in China the Practical solution

2273
01:44:55,139 --> 01:44:56,880
was under the Computing and storage

2274
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,580
separation solution so I think the

2275
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:01,679
requirement of network to provide

2276
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:03,420
service according to the Computing

2277
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:06,060
resource allocation of red region and

2278
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,219
even the service calculus is start to

2279
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:11,940
appear gradually in the recent years so

2280
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:13,860
maybe it's the right time to start doing

2281
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,139
something doing the research on each

2282
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:18,239
okay

2283
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:22,860
okay thank you so next one is um Kenji

2284
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:26,400
do you still you want to withdraw okay

2285
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,880
okay the next one is uh

2286
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,400
Cossack

2287
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,760
cozek are you online yes I am online can

2288
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,239
you hear me yes we can hear you yes

2289
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:42,900
thank you for hosting uh that can Bob uh

2290
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,420
I just wanted to mention that like the

2291
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,760
use cases are valid it's absolutely

2292
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,760
makes sense the service metadata need to

2293
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,639
be distributed to the network age

2294
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,679
especially on the advantage uh for

2295
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:57,840
better decisions making and kind of

2296
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,480
having a better performance throughout

2297
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,960
the network uh so the use case stands

2298
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,760
points it's uh completely makes sense

2299
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,760
and we should do a single operator

2300
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,460
initially uh the how we do that the

2301
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,159
solution wise that's to be kind of need

2302
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:16,980
to be looked like if it is involves the

2303
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:19,020
routing and kind of afraid that maybe

2304
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:21,659
that there are if it's kind of a

2305
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:25,199
existing work group uh we could look

2306
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,300
into the some existing solutions for

2307
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,179
that and the routing group

2308
01:46:29,179 --> 01:46:32,699
so uh that's uh anyway I would be kind

2309
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:36,540
of a happy uh if for the use cases if

2310
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:39,600
anything needed my health

2311
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,460
thank you

2312
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:45,659
so cozek can you state your affiliation

2313
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:49,159
sure I'll do that

2314
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,020
thank you

2315
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:56,040
okay so next one is uh my affiliation is

2316
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,560
uh with the Microsoft

2317
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,380
you can do it on the

2318
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:06,300
notes or you can say it you know okay oh

2319
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,480
foreign

2320
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:16,020
and I think the use cases are valuable

2321
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,139
and for the near future

2322
01:47:18,139 --> 01:47:20,699
introducing Computing information will

2323
01:47:20,699 --> 01:47:23,580
provide more chances to network routing

2324
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:26,760
the problem statements objectives and

2325
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,000
the Milestone are clear I expect to see

2326
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,639
this working group is formed finally

2327
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:36,420
thanks for your work thank you

2328
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:39,960
okay so maybe we let the robin zimbing

2329
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:44,300
to say something he's a SharePoint A.D

2330
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:50,340
I missed this the Milestone uh from my

2331
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:52,739
point of view I think if this we have

2332
01:47:52,739 --> 01:47:55,920
the consensus so I think the first I

2333
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,440
think the work we should defend some

2334
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:01,380
this is the common common meetings about

2335
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:04,920
this Computing info I'm not a I'm not

2336
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:08,520
sure if this included included in the

2337
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:11,639
framework draft or not but in my opinion

2338
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:13,679
so I think it's better this can be

2339
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:15,080
identified

2340
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:18,239
independently I think this this is the

2341
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:20,880
one one thing the second thing I think

2342
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,340
here we'd rather talk about the control

2343
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:26,239
plane and the data plane I think maybe

2344
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:29,460
uh we after this The Matrix can be

2345
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:32,699
defined we also connect maybe three

2346
01:48:32,699 --> 01:48:36,659
years ago we know that it will uh

2347
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:40,800
I forget I had to RS yeah we can do some

2348
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,420
of the discussion about the protocol

2349
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,380
choice

2350
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:45,920
so that's after that we can just use

2351
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,780
computers use the consensus so then we

2352
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:51,420
can go on to discuss about this control

2353
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:53,699
point of data planning solutions that

2354
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:56,280
might comments about some suggestion

2355
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,400
about this Milestone okay

2356
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,980
thanks thank you so do you know that's

2357
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,020
real Dino right

2358
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:08,100
really joding Joel didn't give me a slot

2359
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:09,780
um so I'm not going to make a comment

2360
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:11,400
about if this should be made in the

2361
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,420
working group

2362
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,400
um or if it's a good or bad idea but I

2363
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,139
just want the group to think about this

2364
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:17,940
architecturally from a full stack

2365
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:20,460
perspective and let me set up a scenario

2366
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:23,580
first I'm an application developer

2367
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:25,860
I'm going to write a bunch of code I

2368
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:27,300
have a lot of things I have to worry

2369
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:30,540
about how I use my local CPU memory

2370
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,000
management data structures number of

2371
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,880
threads what apis I use I have a lot to

2372
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:39,179
worry about I so I have my local compute

2373
01:49:39,179 --> 01:49:41,219
resources I have to worry about and

2374
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:42,540
normally I didn't have to worry about

2375
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:45,420
network resources now what's happening

2376
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:46,320
is

2377
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,080
there is a burden on me to just tell the

2378
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,820
network what to do

2379
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,760
let's rewind 20 years back

2380
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,040
the toss bits in the IP header were

2381
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,420
there so the application you could see

2382
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:59,520
how the packet should be handled

2383
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,100
right we could have back then said the

2384
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,719
network should tell the applications how

2385
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:05,520
to set the bits but we never did that

2386
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,719
thank God

2387
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,880
so now what happens is if the

2388
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,800
applications would have set the bits

2389
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,500
like EF and AF used quite a bit today

2390
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:16,199
for audio and video then the packets

2391
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:17,820
could be handled specially for these

2392
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:21,420
specialized applications maybe AR VR has

2393
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:22,920
to have different bit settings than

2394
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,840
audio and video the same or we have to

2395
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:26,880
figure it out but I have a feeling that

2396
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,760
if this group builds something for

2397
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,739
applications the applications are just

2398
01:50:31,739 --> 01:50:33,960
going to ignore it because they don't in

2399
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,340
fact you may give me all this

2400
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:37,260
information and I'm saying oh this is

2401
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,780
great now what does it all mean if I

2402
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:41,580
tweak this and I tweak that how's the

2403
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:43,679
network going to behave will the network

2404
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,139
actually deliver what I say and will it

2405
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,000
deliver it at every single hop along the

2406
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,560
way to the destination

2407
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,659
so I really think that this is going to

2408
01:50:51,659 --> 01:50:53,280
be something that's going to have

2409
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,780
complexity and it's going to be

2410
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:57,719
fruitless and I'm really worried that

2411
01:50:57,719 --> 01:50:59,699
we're not going to make do the best

2412
01:50:59,699 --> 01:51:01,860
thing you can't make the speed of light

2413
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:03,659
go faster so the Network's going to do

2414
01:51:03,659 --> 01:51:05,760
the best it can and it's going to have

2415
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,440
to make decisions quickly based on the

2416
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,719
resources and the size of the cues of

2417
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:12,420
what's going on at this instance so um

2418
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,580
we have to be really careful what you

2419
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:17,280
build here because it may just never get

2420
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,560
used because of its complexity

2421
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,780
Okay so

2422
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:24,300
I'm going to cut the mic line here now

2423
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:27,000
uh we are going to do the poll

2424
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,619
on the screen you can see three

2425
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:30,719
questions I'm going to skip skip the

2426
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:32,699
third one because we know there will be

2427
01:51:32,699 --> 01:51:34,380
many people interested in working on

2428
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:36,719
this so we're going to only focus on

2429
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:39,000
first two questions in in fact the

2430
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,199
second question

2431
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:42,300
we're going to change it to is routing

2432
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:44,820
the right group to attempt to solve it

2433
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,800
okay so the second question is the

2434
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,659
routing the right group to attempt to

2435
01:51:48,659 --> 01:51:51,239
solve it we'll start with the first

2436
01:51:51,239 --> 01:51:52,199
question

2437
01:51:52,199 --> 01:51:54,239
does the community think that the

2438
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:56,040
problem statement is clear and well

2439
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:59,520
scoped I'm going to start a tool

2440
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,780
let's see

2441
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,138
foreign

2442
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:54,420
so just let's repeat so if you raise

2443
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:56,760
your hand that means the problem

2444
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,520
statement is clear and well scoped

2445
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,580
if you click on do not raise hand that

2446
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:04,020
means you're not agreeing that it's

2447
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,940
clear and well scoped

2448
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,800
and of course if you don't do anything

2449
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:08,940
that means you're just not doing

2450
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:10,520
anything

2451
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:14,040
[Laughter]

2452
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:42,900
all right I'm going to end it now uh so

2453
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:45,000
that we can get to the second question

2454
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,320
uh for the record we have 148

2455
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,840
participants uh enter a little choice

2456
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,420
there are 93

2457
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:58,080
who raised the hand and 55 that's not

2458
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:01,320
always hand which means that 50

2459
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:05,219
5 or these changes that people this does

2460
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:08,760
not think that the scope is clear

2461
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:11,100
okay so we are going to end this session

2462
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:12,900
now

2463
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,900
for the second question

2464
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:19,139
is is the routing group the right group

2465
01:54:19,139 --> 01:54:21,060
to solve this problem

2466
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:23,580
in the starter session now again if you

2467
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:26,159
raise your hand you're agreeing that we

2468
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:28,199
should solve it in a routing group

2469
01:54:28,199 --> 01:54:31,800
and if you click on do not return

2470
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,500
you mean mean that you do not or think

2471
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,080
routing group is there a rest group okay

2472
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,780
two things one is I have Greg muttering

2473
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:41,280
in my ear that he thought the first

2474
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,500
question was only does the community

2475
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,960
think the problem statement is clear

2476
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,420
and he thought that it wasn't that well

2477
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:50,820
scoped wasn't part of that question

2478
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:52,679
um

2479
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:55,739
I I had understood it this is the always

2480
01:54:55,739 --> 01:54:57,179
the problem with these polls okay

2481
01:54:57,179 --> 01:54:58,679
they're approximate

2482
01:54:58,679 --> 01:55:02,760
and you know they're not votes and if

2483
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,440
you didn't understand it the way the

2484
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:07,080
chairs met it we should probably should

2485
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:08,699
just move on

2486
01:55:08,699 --> 01:55:10,440
um

2487
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,500
the and I but on on the question that

2488
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,659
you're asking right now I want to

2489
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:19,920
emphasize or to to clarify

2490
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:24,179
um we're asking is the routing area the

2491
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:27,060
right area to be solving it in

2492
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:29,699
thank you yeah so just Jeffrey it's a

2493
01:55:29,699 --> 01:55:32,760
group so are we talking about chartering

2494
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,880
a group in the routing area or

2495
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,880
if you think so then raise your hand if

2496
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,380
you think that we should not be

2497
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:42,020
chartering a group in the routing area

2498
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:44,340
then probably you should not raise your

2499
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,179
hand

2500
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:48,500
thank you thank you

2501
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:04,520
excuse me

2502
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,020
all right I think we're going to end the

2503
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:20,280
session now uh out of 544 people we have

2504
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,980
90 greatest hands and

2505
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:27,379
55 does not raise the hand

2506
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:31,320
okay so now we leave the rest of four

2507
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,699
minutes to jump

2508
01:56:32,699 --> 01:56:35,599
our ad

2509
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,480
thanks everybody for spending the last

2510
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,940
two hours in in a room we didn't

2511
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:47,340
actually intentionally get a room

2512
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:48,780
um that was supposed to make you feel

2513
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:51,780
like you were being stuffed into a can

2514
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:53,699
um but I guess that's what we got

2515
01:56:53,699 --> 01:56:56,040
so thank you for your your patience with

2516
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,300
that

2517
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:58,320
um

2518
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:02,100
so you know as usual I need to go away

2519
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,780
and think about what I've seen and heard

2520
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:05,100
but

2521
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:05,940
um

2522
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,639
it I can't ignore the fact that the

2523
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:11,880
biggest reaction that I heard in the

2524
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:15,360
entire two hours was to Joel's little

2525
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,639
mini speech

2526
01:57:17,639 --> 01:57:21,239
um and in and I think that I heard that

2527
01:57:21,239 --> 01:57:24,360
a bunch of times and that his two points

2528
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:26,099
and you can yell at me if I summarize

2529
01:57:26,099 --> 01:57:27,599
you wrong Joel because I'm not not

2530
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:29,880
referring to notes but the two things I

2531
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:33,960
heard from that were one yep seems like

2532
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,880
there's a I mean and that this is what

2533
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,040
we heard last time too by the way seems

2534
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,599
like there's a legitimate problem that

2535
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:42,420
people legitimately want to solve in a

2536
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:45,679
you know standardized way

2537
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:46,739
um

2538
01:57:46,739 --> 01:57:51,060
but his point number two was

2539
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:52,980
um

2540
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,440
but maybe not in the routing area

2541
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,619
and that's what I heard from Colin also

2542
01:57:58,619 --> 01:58:03,300
and that's what I heard from Dan also

2543
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:07,800
and that's what I heard from

2544
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,599
um you know some of the feedback that

2545
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,000
was coming through on zulup also so

2546
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,159
there's clearly diversity of opinion in

2547
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:15,840
the room

2548
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,639
um the you know the the instrument that

2549
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:19,500
we just used to sort of you know take a

2550
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:20,280
home

2551
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:23,040
you know demonstrates that

2552
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:26,159
there is that diversity of opinion

2553
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:27,239
um

2554
01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:30,060
there's uh right now going out of this

2555
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,460
room I don't think that I could you know

2556
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,920
in good conscience say we have anything

2557
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:37,679
like consensus to work this problem in

2558
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,960
the routing area I think we've got some

2559
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:43,320
very good advice from Colin that

2560
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:48,599
um there's a wealth of expertise in

2561
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:51,239
um applications in real time that if we

2562
01:58:51,239 --> 01:58:54,179
can you know engage the uh the right

2563
01:58:54,179 --> 01:58:56,040
people there we may be able to get some

2564
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,199
extremely interesting feedback I think

2565
01:58:58,199 --> 01:59:01,679
that we should probably pursue that

2566
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:04,320
um and I think that I would like to find

2567
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,780
some time to talk with the proponents at

2568
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:09,360
some time later this week but right now

2569
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,780
I'm not hearing consensus to create a

2570
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:13,920
working group

2571
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,560
in the routing area

2572
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,500
um to pursue this Charter as we've

2573
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,960
currently you know got it on the board

2574
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:24,179
um I am hearing consensus that like I

2575
01:59:24,179 --> 01:59:25,679
said there's

2576
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:28,500
there's work to be done but we

2577
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,199
we need to nail down where and how and

2578
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:33,360
and what oh by the way the other thing

2579
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,760
one other thing that I heard is that

2580
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,560
there continues to be

2581
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:41,760
um you know a minority of people that uh

2582
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,520
really would love to um actually do

2583
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,619
something more radical which is to you

2584
01:59:46,619 --> 01:59:48,119
know

2585
01:59:48,119 --> 01:59:50,219
work the problem in the underlay and

2586
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:53,219
that we we should um you know yes we

2587
01:59:53,219 --> 01:59:55,139
should have the uh the you know the

2588
01:59:55,139 --> 01:59:56,760
routing system

2589
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,639
um

2590
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:02,219
trying to solve this problem and I the

2591
02:00:02,219 --> 02:00:04,440
one thing that I heard consensus for

2592
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,360
more strongly than maybe anything else

2593
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:09,360
is that no we shouldn't do that

2594
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,980
um sometimes consensus is Right

2595
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:12,300
sometimes it's wrong but that's what I

2596
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:14,460
think the consensus is

2597
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:16,020
um so

2598
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:17,400
that's what I heard in the last two

2599
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:18,480
hours

2600
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,639
um thank you all for your work on this

2601
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,260
thank you all for your time

2602
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:25,020
and I think we're concluded

2603
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:27,739
thank you

2604
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:30,420
thank you to the chairs for organizing

2605
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:33,739
and to all the proponents

2606
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,739
so the meeting is adjourned

2607
02:00:40,739 --> 02:00:43,459
thank you

2608
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:11,119
sure

2609
02:01:15,719 --> 02:01:17,719
um

2610
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:48,380
thank you

2611
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,179
I don't think so because they didn't

2612
02:01:57,179 --> 02:01:59,780
mention it
