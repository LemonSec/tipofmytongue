individuals bringing the technical work

28

participants remote As we have in this

31

very small room here I'm not sure why we

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,080
got sized the way we did so it will be

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,180
kind of intimate uh what we have up are

34

we have uh this is the agenda we

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,680
previously had published we're going to

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,659
go through the administrative and

51
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,240
summaries of the area we're going to

52
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,899
have Morgan Cullen give us a talk on

53
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,940
significant adoption of a couple of key

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,700
ietf Technologies then we're going to

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,280
talk about formal verification it's a

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,140
topic that has popped up in a couple of

57
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,140
other places and then we Justin Richard

58
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,599
is going to talk to us about hdb message

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,400
signatures which is I believe in working

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,660
from last call in HTTP this

61
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,239
pausing there for any agenda bashing

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,280
not hearing any let's press forward uh

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,080
wanted to want to call out a couple of

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,300
things participating in the security

65
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,540
area means a lot of different things uh

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,760
we welcome we welcome you kind of

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
hearing more uh more from interested

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,480
participants about how you would like to

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,220
participate there of course is sitting

70
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,620
on this side of the of the room if

71
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,060
you're interested in being a chair

72
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,420
please let us know another great way to

73
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,680
get involved in kind of the real

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,420
business of how the working groups do

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,819
things is be a document Shepherd this

76
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,860
gives you a lot of insight into how to

77
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,560
do document reviews and ietf process and

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,300
it is a tremendous help to the working

79
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,700
group The working group authors and to

80
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,920
and to pollinate we're going to talk

81
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,140
about this later there are all sorts of

82
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,360
Errata in the security area that we need

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,400
to do a little bit better job at closing

84
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,280
this is another way to learn about how

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,620
we do maintenance on on ITF protocols

86
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,959
that we publish some in active working

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,879
groups some not so much and that's

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,260
certainly a place where we need a lot of

89
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,959
help and then of course participating is

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,180
uh you know if you can't make it in

91
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,879
person the virtual experience uh these

92
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,379
are you know virtual participants are

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,879
first order participants kind of as well

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,280
so please join especially in boss to

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,840
help us understand what work we want to

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,099
bring into the ITF

97
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,019
so I will say you're going to see

98
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,060
something a little bit different uh Paul

99
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,920
introduced an innovation here then maybe

100
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,299
we don't need to run through all the

101
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,760
different working groups uh so we are

102
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,379
going to largely manage the queue from

103
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,180
now on by exception if folks want to

104
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,519
come come forward and talk about things

105
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,920
so first uh first order of things we've

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,720
had some changes in working groups and

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,700
some talk of new work since we last met

108
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,760
at ietf 14. we had a virtual buff

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,720
between 14 and 15. uh originally titled

110
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,240
Json web proofs and then if you jump to

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
the next category there was consensus

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,979
out of the both in person we had an

113
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,419
in-person buff and then we had a virtual

114
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,520
buff coming out of that virtual Bob we

115
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,840
had consensus to move forward with

116
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
chartering to reopen the Jose working

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,580
group and that is in Flight uh that is

118
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,900
in flight now it's going to be looked at

119
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,660
the isg in early December uh earlier

120
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,540
this week we also had the rad X buff

121
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,880
which is to reopen uh is to do more

122
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,100
radius work and then we also had the SAT

123
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,860
P buff and meeting for the first time as

124
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,560
a working group is is skit

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,600
a thing to kind of call out is what's at

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,840
the bottom uh the ITF overall introduced

127
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,780
a new way to do Buffs or brought back

128
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,460
I'm told for for folks that have

129
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,380
participated a long time this notion of

130
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,479
virtual interim Buffs that is you don't

131
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,100
have to wait to the face-to-face meeting

132
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,080
to have a Bob we've now used that

133
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,960
successfully three times so Tigris which

134
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,220
is in the app area with security

135
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,580
considerations we used it to uh to move

136
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,919
skit forward and we also used it to move

137
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,780
forward to what what's getting chartered

138
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,160
now we'll see on the community feedback

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,919
in Jose and so kind of bottom line it

140
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,720
looks like it's cutting out at least a

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,720
half meeting cycle for work to get new

142
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,520
work kind of Chartered and it looks like

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,259
a successful approach and I see us

144
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,060
continuing to to use that

145
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,600
uh so this is uh this is the compression

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,759
of what normally would be 20 slides

147
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
thank you kind of Paul a lot of working

148
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,840
groups met him this last week I believe

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,759
almost all of them sent a summary to the

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,500
sagless that's where all the details are

151
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,020
we invite any working group chairs or

152
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,820
participants to come up to the mic and

153
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,680
now tell us about Hot Topics or anything

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,780
they think Sac should know about those

155
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,859
previous meetings this week

156
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,340
and as

157
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,720
I was going to say this could be

158
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,400
positive news as well if you want to be

159
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,539
proud and come to the mic

160
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,120
and also to talk about kind of process

161
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,400
here the next question is always do you

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,479
want to come up with Mike to talk about

163
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,880
non-sec area so flipping back and forth

164
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,620
did something happen that you think is

165
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,080
security relevant across the ITF this

166
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,460
week that you want to share with us at

167
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,698
sac

168
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,660
all right well perfect I'm sure we're

169
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,680
going to read everything that's on the

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,139
mailing list

171
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,680
okay so pulling us to to some of the

172
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,479
administrative updates that the 80s

173
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,460
would like to to share with you first we

174
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,380
want to we want to highlight that

175
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,419
working one of the ways in which uh

176
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,919
working groups are successful it really

177
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,539
is because of the leadership of the

178
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,580
chairs facilitating the technical work

179
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,039
so to highlight some changes we want to

180
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,220
thank Mohit and Richard for for chairing

181
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,740
cassette Dispatch they have rotated out

182
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,840
uh if you're on the SEC dispatch kind of

183
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,220
mailing list one of the things that we

184
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,500
did is uh you know really rethought what

185
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,360
to do with standing working groups so

186
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,860
with working groups that don't have an

187
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,960
end to their work like SEC dispatch when

188
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,259
a working group chairs signs up the exit

189
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,199
plan is unless we say you know let's

190
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,060
rethink this or they tell us they're out

191
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,099
they will be working group chairs uh

192
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,020
kind of indefinitely we wanted to set up

193
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,300
a rotation process and so we've roughly

194
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,220
created a policy insect dispatch that

195
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,139
it's about a four-year term unless you

196
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,940
know we think there's an issue or a day

197
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,520
or they would like to step down and so

198
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,979
Richard uh has been in in that role for

199
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,120
four and a half four and a half years

200
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,099
and really launched the process for us

201
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,699
rifat is stepping in for him uh Kathleen

202
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,479
is uh is three years into the term uh

203
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,520
the next I'm sorry this coming summer in

204
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,220
iatf17 she is going to rotate out and we

205
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,259
would expect that uh the Ed's kind of at

206
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,300
the time Paul and whoever is the ad at

207
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,979
the time will kind of make that make

208
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,360
that selection so this is kind of this

209
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,099
idea of withstanding working groups we

210
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,319
should rethink what happened friends and

211
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,880
then we spun up the new skit working

212
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,860
group and so kind of thanks to John and

213
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,560
honest for for for stepping in to to

214
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,039
lead us

215
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,819
if you are interested in working group

216
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,800
sharing we regularly put out a call to

217
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
Sag and we were going to continue to do

218
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,740
that you don't in fact need to wait for

219
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,479
the call if you are interested drop us

220
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,680
kind of a note and when there are

221
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
chairing opportunities uh we consider

222
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,640
that list

223
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,320
we didn't create any non-working group

224
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,860
mailing lists so

225
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
our cue for ad sponsor documents is

226
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,940
getting kind of a little bit deeper so

227
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,459
this is real time as of uh real-time as

228
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,279
of at least SEC dispatch uh yesterday uh

229
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,060
where we added the draft legit uh SP CAC

230
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,060
for for ad sponsorship and then we have

231
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,279
not yet closed the action item for SEC

232
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,880
dispatch 114 to land draft East Lake fnv

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,160
but we are going to work on it

234
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,500
are there any questions about the ad

235
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,440
sponsor drafts we are holding

236
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,360
we especially Point them out here

237
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,519
because of for folks a little less

238
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,200
familiar with the process 80 sponsorship

239
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,000
means it's not going through a working

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,360
group so the review process is the

241
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
formal ITF last call and whenever we as

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880
ads trigger so these documents are here

243
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,100
primarily so you have visibility assat

244
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,440
and we would beg for your reviews on

245
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,940
those documents to make sure that they

246
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,220
leave the ITF and is the best quality as

247
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,820
we can get them

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,899
foreign

249
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,060
so I talked about this a little bit

250
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,080
about erotic processing we need a little

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,620
bit of help the backlog is growing a

252
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,980
little bit each and every time the The

253
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,899
Heavy Hitters are the working groups you

254
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,500
see here below we would ask that those

255
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,440
working groups help us burn down that

256
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,720
backlog

257
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,740
we nudge again

258
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,040
one unique thing that we did that it

259
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,540
isn't kind of part of this structural

260
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,399
update that you've seen a number of

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,820
times is reconvened uh what we call the

262
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,640
pqc next steps or additional next step

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
side meeting on Monday and the thinking

264
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,640
there was we saw a tremendous amount of

265
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,100
energy on the pqc mailing list that we

266
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,920
spun up a little bit before ietf 14.

267
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,220
additionally we had uh we had a sec

268
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,459
dispatch result in 114 to pick up a

269
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,380
pickup what we considered a transition

270
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,140
support document around pqc and after

271
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,640
kind of thinking about the energy on the

272
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,620
list and what we wanted to do with that

273
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,920
document we we shopped around a charter

274
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,140
to what we're calling the pqc transition

275
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,000
support working group so this is a

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
working group that is not intended to

277
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,459
change existing protocols it is uh it is

278
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,040
a forum which to discuss design and

279
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,660
transition choices that are relevant

280
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,700
across the the SEC working groups and

281
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,360
probably across kind of the ietf and and

282
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,160
all it's permitted to do is that

283
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,500
facilitation that discussion and when

284
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,440
discussion really is probably reusable

285
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,060
or it makes sense for it to be durable

286
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,339
for archival purposes they uh that

287
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,600
working group would have the ability to

288
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,940
charge to sorry publish informational

289
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,320
documents

290
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,940
it appeared we had consensus for that

291
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,579
from the mailing list uh uh to mailing

292
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,320
list it appeared there was really strong

293
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,820
support for that from the side beating

294
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,800
so at this point uh we are likely to

295
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,560
proceed with chartering the big blocker

296
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,899
is as everything in the ietf one of the

297
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,399
most important things is choosing a name

298
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,320
which we have not and we've got to dial

299
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,140
in the uh dial in the deliverable so we

300
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,339
welcome kind of additional kind of

301
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,260
feedback and polish please put that on

302
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,540
the pqc list there is a very long thread

303
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,459
uh about what's there

304
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,500
other things we talked about were

305
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,420
oh yeah sure who's Paul

306
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,000
um you just said something that now that

307
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,440
you didn't say

308
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,620
um in the boff that that I'm or the side

309
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,000
meeting that I'm a little bit concerned

310
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,820
you said informational documents whereas

311
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,459
Sometimes some of the discussion in was

312
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,920
about best current practices

313
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,980
oh sorry I I was being imprecise what I

314
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,200
meant to say is we are not doing PS

315
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,660
great we're not doing standard right

316
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,940
thank you and we're not making changes

317
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,000
to proposal to I'm sorry protocols

318
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
yeah please check the charter text I

319
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,480
believe we do say that but if not let's

320
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,820
publish uh we asked two other questions

321
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,800
and this is a little bit of we see

322
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,660
energy and we've been coming back to you

323
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,000
in Sag double checking where we want to

324
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,940
be as a community we were trying to

325
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,040
check out where do we think we have

326
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
there is a bunch of working groups that

327
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,820
are active doing pqc kinds of things we

328
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,620
wanted to check are there technologies

329
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,260
that were previously in the ITF or ITF

330
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,420
adjacent where we think work needs to

331
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,339
happen but there is not a natural place

332
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,320
to do that work to perhaps kind of

333
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,660
figure out how we should discuss uh

334
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,180
agility in those working groups so the

335
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,600
from the side meeting we heard SSH we

336
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,120
heard Kerberos and we held we heard XML

337
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,700
signature if you think there are more

338
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,920
please kind of let us know if you go to

339
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
that GitHub site that we're going to

340
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,060
migrate to the ITF kind of Wiki uh there

341
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,560
there's kind of a place where we're

342
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,779
capturing that list and then the third

343
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,480
question we asked was we often rely on

344
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,180
the ITF on directors to help us do

345
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,160
document reviews for specialized things

346
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,019
so A specialized I mean we have the

347
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,240
security director but we also have Niche

348
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,100
things like Yang so if you have a Yang

349
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,720
document you can go to the Yang doctors

350
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,480
to help you specifically do that the

351
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,519
question was asked do we think we need

352
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,100
something for just post one cryptography

353
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,040
reviews so a pqc directorate the

354
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,440
feedback from the side beating was no it

355
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,019
is we're not ready uh and now is not the

356
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,639
time to do that

357
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,720
if you want kind of more information

358
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,639
there are some references there

359
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,200
okay other highlights uh we try to uh Us

360
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,540
in the security directory try to keep a

361
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,120
running list of things that we are

362
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,880
likely to discuss on at the isg telechat

363
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,620
and this is a little bit of a service to

364
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,639
the rest of the ietf of hey write good

365
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,920
security considerations but here's

366
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
another list to double check because

367
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,639
even after you know having all the

368
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,839
guidance we have about writing security

369
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
considerations Paul and I often find is

370
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,660
find find common themes and so that URL

371
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,360
up there is what what is the common

372
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,240
themes we see the sector review putting

373
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,740
in kind of feedback hey you need to

374
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,420
think a little bit more about that or

375
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,519
issues that Paul and I commonly discuss

376
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,500
on this is kind of a running list this

377
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,060
is uh you know something that that we

378
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,139
started it could have a number of years

379
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,699
ago I just highlight that if you have

380
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,620
feedback for other things perhaps you

381
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,660
are doing if you are reviewing documents

382
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,920
that have been working in the working

383
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,160
groups one thing we just added added to

384
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,380
that list because we are seeing it in a

385
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,240
number of recent and kind of child chats

386
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
is that working that documents are

387
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,279
coming to the telechat review and they

388
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,079
are saying we are Fielding this in a

389
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,199
limited domain and beyond that there

390
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,240
isn't a lot of specification about what

391
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,320
are the security properties of that

392
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,820
domain how are you bounding that domain

393
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,079
and how are you controlling things are

394
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,240
in there and so that's an example of a

395
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,399
flavor of kind of common themes uh that

396
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,720
we would put on that

397
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,519
if you want to get a sense for where we

398
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,139
are with your documents those are the

399
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,360
pointers to the queue there is fairly

400
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,040
detailed kind of inside you know when we

401
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,839
take the document for isg processing

402
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,760
where we are uh kind of with that

403
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,820
process and how far we have uh Advanced

404
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,600
it

405
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,899
just a reminder we have a sec area SEC

406
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,139
area kind of Wiki The igf is migrating

407
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,720
its Wiki technology from track to Wiki

408
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,360
JS so that URL is where we are right now

409
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,639
I would expect uh in a couple of weeks

410
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,320
that URL will be will be something

411
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,360
different after that migration occurs

412
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
we'll make sure we set uh on your

413
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,380
pointer around

414
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,500
and uh we are in that in that time of

415
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
year in the ITF where we have spun up

416
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,760
the nomcom to choose the new leadership

417
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,899
for the ietf uh as as every year there

418
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,660
are kind of candidates for the isg so

419
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,399
with the security ad all the rest of the

420
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,980
aeds for the IAB and kind of the other

421
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,199
key leadership positions the nomcom

422
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,060
really relies on the community for

423
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,820
feedback on how to make their choices so

424
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,399
please uh if you want to have a say in

425
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,980
how leadership is chosen at the ietf uh

426
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,899
go to that URL and provide feedback on

427
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,500
those candidates

428
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,040
in close

429
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,279
in close we can't emphasize enough how

430
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
helpful the security director is to the

431
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,440
ietf to help the working groups

432
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,500
polish the documents find issues and

433
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,519
really

434
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,860
get us to the point where when we go to

435
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,920
RFC the documents aren't as good as they

436
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,799
can be and with as well-rounded of any

437
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,900
kind of an assessment so thank you to

438
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,119
the security directorate they made kind

439
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,859
of this possible and these are all the

440
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,359
folks that that helped us review

441
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,339
documents across all of the working

442
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,079
groups for everything that went to ietf

443
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,299
last call since we got together

444
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,059
and also a big shout out to uh tuchero

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,099
reviews and literally uh every week to

447
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,660
every kind of two weeks is making the

448
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,280
assignments of those documents and What

449
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,299
needs to

450
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,320
meet if you are interested in

451
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,240
participating in security directorate

452
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,299
please email uh Paul and may uh and then

453
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,780
we can have a comment

454
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,679
s all right so I will pause there anyone

455
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,299
have any comments kind of questions for

456
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,039
the administrative thing before we get

457
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,900
to the meat of some of our talks

458
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,080
true I'm just checking the Q here

459
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,539
the queue is clear so in that case uh

460
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,039
we're going to switch over to Margaret

461
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,840
who's going to tell us about uh edu

462
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,960
Roman some adoption of of ITF technology

463
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,020
at scale as an implementation report

464
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,419
so Margaret if you want to hop on I I'm

465
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,679
going to switch the slides for you

466
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,740
okay

467
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,780
I think I'm here can everybody hear me

468
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,480
we sure can the floor is yours

469
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,720
uh so I'm gonna talk about uh an

470
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,880
implementation report on the use of the

471
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,059
Ben radius for U.S Edge room

472
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,220
um edu Rome is a service that's been

473
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,460
around for a long time 20 plus years U.S

474
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,140
said Jerome has been around for a long

475
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,380
time we did a new implementation of us

476
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,120
edgerobe in AWS and it was new to us to

477
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,580
operate and deploy this service and so

478
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,039
we're gonna offer some observations we

479
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,780
had about

480
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,700
um about those Technologies while we

481
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,200
were doing that so next slide

482
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,360
um we worked with internet too who

483
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,419
operates the U.S Edge Rome service to

484
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,200
implement and deploy a new Amazon web

485
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
services based U.S Edge Rome

486
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,100
infrastructure uh it went live in

487
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,320
November of 2021

488
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,780
uh so we've been operating it monitoring

489
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,600
and maintaining it for about a year uh

490
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,340
it's free radius based it's

491
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,799
geographically redundant and then within

492
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,140
each geographic region it is load

493
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,480
balanced and I will talk more about that

494
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,419
the goal of this presentation is to

495
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,600
share our experiences implementing and

496
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,539
operating this service

497
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:47,760
and much of this presentation focuses on

498
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,320
Need for improvement but I want to

499
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,480
emphasize that a lot of those things are

500
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,760
small things and actually the overall

501
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,740
experience has been very positive and

502
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,559
highly successful so it's um up and

503
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,960
running and it's stable and it's working

504
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,480
well but there are a lot of small things

505
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,380
that we think either could be modernized

506
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,260
or added that would make it a lot a lot

507
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,660
easier to deal with so next slide

508
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,039
um so this is a little outline of the

509
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,360
talk the first thing I'm going to do is

510
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,820
a quick review of what Edge room is just

511
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,380
because there may be people in the room

512
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,820
who don't know what I'm talking about at

513
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,940
all and try to bring them up to speed

514
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,679
and then um we'll do an overview of the

515
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,380
US said your own deployment uh including

516
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,240
how we deployed the infrastructure and

517
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,000
some facts and figures about it then

518
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,640
talk about how requests are routed in

519
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
entero and some things about how that

520
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,640
works that have been a struggle uh some

521
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,200
security challenges that we've run into

522
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,720
and also some operational challenges

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,539
that we've run into so next slide

524
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,799
at your room is a widely used

525
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,900
international roaming service for Higher

526
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,700
Education and Research as I said it's

527
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,559
Josh sitting in the front row could

528
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,000
probably tell us exactly how long it's

529
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
been out because I believe he did the

530
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,780
first deployment of it but it's been out

531
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,000
for a long time decades

532
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,039
um it allows students and staff from

533
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,440
education or research institutions to

534
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,380
access the internet at remote Edge room

535
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,179
service locations

536
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,780
so basically there's a common SSID Edge

537
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,620
room

538
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,140
and students walk around having free

539
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,440
seamless access to the internet using

540
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,080
the edurome SSID just like you could

541
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,539
walk around your house

542
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,700
um you know if you had multiple access

543
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,380
points in your house and use the same

544
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,659
SSID and never have to change your

545
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,760
configuration or go to a captive portal

546
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,600
or do anything to stay on the internet

547
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,700
sometimes it could provide more

548
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,980
privileges or better performance than a

549
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,500
public guest access but even when it

550
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,539
doesn't the fact that it's free and

551
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,320
seamless is in itself a better service

552
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,679
uh there's a home institution which is

553
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,100
the identity provider for the user so a

554
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,140
student would have a home institution at

555
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,120
the University they attend

556
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,299
uh and they actually that University

557
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,200
will have verified the user's identity

558
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,940
and provided credentials to them to use

559
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,000
Edge room then that student can go to

560
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,860
other locations at your own Service

561
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,179
locations uh relying parties right and

562
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,159
visit those locations and get access to

563
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,900
the internet

564
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,280
um with that location proxying an

565
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,320
authentication request into the central

566
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,780
infrastructure which goes back to the

567
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,120
home institution and authenticates the

568
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,679
user

569
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,440
millions of students from thousands of

570
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,840
Home institutions access Edge Aroma tens

571
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,460
of thousands of service locations

572
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,380
throughout the world it's a very

573
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,020
large scale service and if you want to

574
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,900
hear more about edurome itself you can

575
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,440
go to that URL there or talk to class

576
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,600
because I think he he works at that

577
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,460
organization and knows everything about

578
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,640
the central Ledger room service but if

579
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
you go to the next slide

580
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,159
I have a little picture of how it works

581
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,000
here

582
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,860
um uh

583
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,679
if you look on the right hand side

584
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,559
well let's start with there's a user and

585
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,919
the user is John at

586
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,280
institution.home okay uh he once was at

587
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,100
his home over on the left and he got

588
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,440
identified there got issued a student ID

589
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,020
he got issued credentials he then

590
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,340
traveled to another institution

591
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,840
institution.visit where he wanted to get

592
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,860
on the network

593
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,440
so he logs into the network using his

594
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,600
home credentials

595
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,980
and the visited Network goes up to the

596
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,500
edger room top level radius server over

597
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,880
to his

598
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,020
home IDP he gets authenticated the

599
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,600
answer comes back and he ends up on the

600
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,620
network

601
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,320
I just somehow lost my slides which is

602
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,760
going to make it interesting when I tell

603
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,980
you to switch to the next slide yes

604
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,720
we're going to rectify that I lost the

605
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,980
slots here standby

606
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,740
okay so you can go forward to that that

607
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,240
picture and then oops nope back

608
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,200
okay next

609
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,880
uh there's a bunch of underlying

610
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,500
Technologies I could have made a much

611
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,919
longer list of rfcs here uh but these

612
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,659
are the core ones um radius Eep

613
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,919
how you run you know Eep over radius and

614
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,600
then the various methods that you can

615
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,179
use for Eep authentication and then also

616
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,280
the

617
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,860
802.11 and 802.1 expects from the IEEE

618
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,559
are the core technologies that are used

619
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,260
in edurope next slide

620
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,299
there's a proxy hierarchy in engine room

621
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,000
that lets it run all over the world and

622
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,159
the way that this proxy hierarchy works

623
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,900
is that the individual edurome

624
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,820
institutions have their own radius

625
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,640
servers could be the same radius servers

626
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,039
that they use to have people log in at

627
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,860
other ssids or could be dedicated to

628
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,279
eduro that's totally up to them

629
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,940
their local servers are configured to

630
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,559
send any

631
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,000
well at least when you're on the edge

632
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,760
room SSID to send requests for any

633
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,279
Realms that aren't local to them

634
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,960
up to the National servers at which they

635
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,720
are registered and the national servers

636
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,240
are set up so that they send any Realms

637
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,779
that aren't in their Nation up to the

638
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:07,200
top level servers in Europe and Asia

639
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,380
and that is basically how edger room

640
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,179
requests are are routed throughout the

641
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,299
world

642
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,299
um next slide

643
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,260
um so now we're going to talk about the

644
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,299
US said your own deployment if on the

645
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:22,799
previous slide I had thought to mention

646
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,179
it I could have said one of those

647
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,820
National servers is

648
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,240
um the U.S national server and that

649
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,299
server is run or that proxy the U.S

650
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,360
national proxy is run by uh internet 2

651
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,779
in common and we work with them to to

652
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,640
run that service

653
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,299
um

654
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,659
the U.S Edge robe service has greater

655
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,640
than a thousand home institutions or

656
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,840
idps

657
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,840
greater than 3 000 service access points

658
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,380
or RPS and somewhere in the area of 2

659
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,419
million eligible students and staff to

660
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,500
use the service

661
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,419
we can't say how many people are

662
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,100
actually using it

663
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,440
because some people only use it locally

664
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,500
we we can only see uh from running the

665
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,799
the national proxy the people who roam

666
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,080
so we we don't know exactly how many

667
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,760
people out of those eligible students

668
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,159
are using it there's a URL here if you

669
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,520
want to see more about U.S Edge Rome

670
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,960
um but I don't want to go into a huge

671
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,240
amount of like it's a edge room took

672
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,200
tutorial so that's basically U.S Central

673
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,039
and uh next slide

674
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,679
um the way we're currently deploying the

675
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,080
architecture as I said it's in uh Amazon

676
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,360
web services this picture has a lot of

677
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,820
details on it only some of which really

678
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,320
matter

679
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,659
um first off this is half of our

680
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,400
deployment this is the East Coast

681
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,440
deployment there's a mirror image on the

682
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,580
West Coast

683
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,059
uh we have a server

684
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,120
um in the internet2 data center that the

685
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,919
traffic comes into at an internet to

686
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,000
address

687
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,279
uh it is

688
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,779
there's a

689
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,539
sort of traffic engineering activity

690
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,880
that happens there where the the

691
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,700
software the traffic isn't added and

692
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,360
sent over VPN tunnel to AWS where we run

693
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,720
the actual VPN a router to be the

694
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,520
endpoint of the VPN and then the actual

695
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
radius proxies this picture shows a

696
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,320
primary and a backup because it hasn't

697
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,940
been updated yet but actually at this

698
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,679
point we're load sharing between the two

699
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,360
servers running

700
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,720
um any on each coast and as I said it's

701
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,120
then duplicated so we have four servers

702
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,600
running all acting as a single cluster

703
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,260
of servers as far as the The Edge robe

704
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,779
Services is concerned

705
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,380
um next slide

706
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,940
um I thought it'd be interesting to give

707
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,980
some facts and figures of of what we've

708
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,720
been doing um

709
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,880
up to a hundred thousand radius messages

710
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,900
are received per minute at at peak times

711
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,760
um we get uh we see somewhere you know

712
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,559
greater than 12 000 unique

713
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,539
authentication requests coming through

714
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,240
per minute an authentication request

715
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,940
involves several packet exchanges so

716
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,700
it's um if there's not any sort of uh

717
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,500
one-to-one

718
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,399
um between uh messages and

719
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,960
authentication requests that complete

720
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,440
about two-thirds 65 percent

721
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,059
um of the authentication requests that

722
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,100
are made in the U.S get an access accept

723
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,580
and about 35 get an access reject this

724
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,220
is of authentication requests that

725
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,140
complete without some sort of internal

726
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,679
error about 18 of the requests we

727
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,980
receive are rejected or discarded by our

728
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,039
proxy and some of the biggest reasons

729
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,159
that that happens are request looping

730
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,380
where basically proxy looping where

731
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,299
basically we're receiving back a request

732
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,059
that we've already touched

733
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,820
um missing or malformed username or

734
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,840
Realm

735
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,100
unknown client just isn't registered

736
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,240
with us or is it known to us an invalid

737
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,480
authenticator or a malformed message

738
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,260
those are the errors that we most often

739
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,100
um

740
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,340
C that cause us to reject or discard any

741
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,240
incoming request next slide

742
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,700
uh the eat method distribution I thought

743
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,500
this was interesting when I first saw it

744
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,980
we see about 75 percent peep fifteen

745
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,720
percent epls and 12 ttls uh this is from

746
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,559
a report in q1 of 2022. uh we have I

747
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,299
haven't like gone through and tried to

748
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,980
look at it again to see if we have any

749
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,360
Trends but

750
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,720
um but that's where we were at that time

751
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,559
um next slide

752
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,419
um one of the things that's tricky about

753
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,240
Ed Jerome is the way that we handle the

754
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,820
request routing um there are two sets of

755
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,860
top level Edge room operators one in

756
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,740
Europe and one in Asia uh and there's a

757
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,299
national roaming operator in each

758
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,820
country who's responsible for enrolling

759
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,039
the edurome institutions in that country

760
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,200
and also proxying between them so only

761
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,460
requests that go from one country to

762
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,500
another go through those top level Edge

763
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,760
Rome

764
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,520
um servers within a country they go

765
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,860
through the national ledgerum server and

766
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,919
then uh locally within an institution

767
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,740
they would just go to the institution

768
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,419
server

769
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:37,260
um

770
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,620
each of the nros provides a Json

771
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,299
formatted list of their enrolled

772
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,399
institutions to their top level provider

773
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,919
for example U.S federal provides a list

774
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,620
to jayant in Europe

775
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,520
um

776
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,460
if that sounds a lot like a 1980s

777
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,500
internet host file that's would be

778
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,600
because it is a lot like a 1980s

779
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,120
internet host file okay we say we know

780
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,240
these hosts and basically the whole

781
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,700
thing is being routed by files that are

782
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,760
being exchanged once a day

783
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,679
saying the all these people are under me

784
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,840
please send their traffic to me

785
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,620
um

786
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,720
if um

787
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,760
so if an institution radio server

788
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,799
receives a non-local request it goes to

789
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,500
the nro radius proxy the nro radius

790
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,899
proxy does not have a matching realm

791
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,240
registered it forwards it up to a top

792
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,799
level server

793
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,720
um the way our servers work if the

794
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,580
country code is included in the Rel name

795
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,220
we forward the request accordingly we

796
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,320
send Asian countries to Asia and

797
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,899
European countries to Europe but what we

798
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,919
do if the country code is

799
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,520
not in Europe for Asia or if there's no

800
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,220
country code it's just example.com

801
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,640
is that we do some round robin between

802
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,039
the top level servers there's multiple

803
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,700
servers in in each of Europe and Asia

804
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,740
um and if the top level operator doesn't

805
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,720
have a registration request of the realm

806
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,039
they need to fold it over to the other

807
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,940
top level operator and so basically

808
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,440
things can be forwarded several times

809
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,919
this isn't a completely flat structure

810
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,779
so if you look at the next slide

811
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,840
um and inefficient this is like the most

812
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,460
inefficient you could be in a real

813
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,880
example you know is that a user from

814
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,100
example.com which happens to be a

815
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,340
Canadian institution in my example

816
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,600
visits a US Edge your own service

817
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,480
location and attempts to join entero

818
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,360
the service location radius server so

819
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,919
that's the first radius server that

820
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,440
touches it determines that example.com

821
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,380
is not in the U.S it's not local to that

822
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,720
institution and it forwards the request

823
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,240
to one of the us as your own proxies the

824
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,159
U.S and your own proxy that's the second

825
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,340
radius server to touch the packet

826
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,080
determines that example.com is not a

827
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,899
realm registered in the U.S finds no

828
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,720
country code and forwards the request to

829
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,480
an Asian top-level radius proxy just by

830
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,500
round robin

831
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,159
the Asian proxy that's the third proxy

832
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,780
to touch this

833
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,159
packet this request this message

834
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,980
um determines that the IDP realm realm

835
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,619
example.com is not registered

836
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,379
in Asia so it forwards their quest to a

837
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,960
European top level server the European

838
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,399
top level server determines that

839
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,520
example.com is registered uh by Canada

840
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,040
who I am presuming registers with Europe

841
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
but I could be wrong and forwards that

842
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,980
request to Canada's radius proxy the

843
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,639
Canadian proxy that being the fifth

844
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,480
um

845
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,800
proxy forwards the request to one of

846
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,480
example.com's radius servers and that is

847
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,179
the sixth radius server

848
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,619
um to actually see this request so it

849
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,099
can go through six proxy hops

850
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,500
um before well through six servers five

851
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,980
hops before it gets to the

852
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,320
the ultimate destination and that could

853
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,460
be

854
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,599
a normal

855
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,260
successful authentication exchange so

856
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,540
the next slide

857
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,300
so I'll forward your slides Margaret uh

858
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,460
can you really retry your video we just

859
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,300
lost your video feed

860
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,040
Hop Off

861
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,460
there you are perfect thank you

862
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,040
um so you know you could say well six

863
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,380
six hops or you know five hops through

864
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,300
six servers is not that much but um it's

865
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,220
actually the case that a successful Edge

866
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,220
room Authentication

867
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,000
also requires several request response

868
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,740
exchanges

869
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,140
um I've seen them from three to seven

870
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,180
although I don't think we get three

871
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,900
using the methods I just listed

872
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,560
um and it depends on the eat method and

873
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,720
the size of the credentials and a few

874
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,020
other things but we see several usually

875
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,079
um message exchanges so request resp

876
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,680
like like uh access request access

877
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,420
challenge access request access

878
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,800
challenge you know

879
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,440
um request response exchanges uh before

880
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,180
we get to an answer

881
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,960
in a typical radius request so

882
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
um we're seeing a multiplicative value

883
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,680
there right we're going through six hops

884
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,099
we've got let's say five messages

885
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,099
um and every time a message goes through

886
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,859
a hop there's a cryptographic message

887
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,020
authentication performed

888
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,260
so more efficient routing than this

889
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,839
would be highly desirable a lot of times

890
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,820
people aren't waiting to get on the

891
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,619
network but if you are waiting to get on

892
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,180
the network the delay can be quite

893
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,980
noticeable

894
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,500
um from

895
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,079
using radius

896
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,760
but it's hard to know how to get more

897
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,040
efficient routing because we don't do

898
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,560
any sort of dynamic routing and we don't

899
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,660
even have the equivalent of icmp

900
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,960
redirects so even if Asia knew that

901
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,420
example.com

902
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,040
should have gone to Europe there's no

903
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,940
way for them to tell us

904
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,680
and there's no standard mechanism for

905
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,619
Loop detection or prevention so this

906
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,780
complexity sometimes does seem to result

907
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,900
in looping which is it varies a little

908
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,380
bit but often is the highest rate of um

909
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,300
errors we're getting that's causing us

910
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,460
to discard packets

911
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,200
so next slide

912
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,660
the other thing we found that was

913
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,940
difficult for us is that there are

914
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,140
very few testing or debugging tools for

915
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,820
this type of multi-level proxy

916
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,760
fabric there's um

917
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,280
when a remote EPA radius request is

918
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,140
dropped or rejected it can be very

919
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,940
difficult to figure out why it didn't

920
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,940
work or even figure out what server

921
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,740
dropped it or ejected it a lot of things

922
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,540
are silently dropped

923
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,359
so

924
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,579
and access reject messages don't

925
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,619
typically contain a useful error code

926
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,140
even if you do get an access reject

927
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,960
method back a message back so you're

928
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,520
you're often trying to figure out what

929
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,560
went wrong

930
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,920
um there's a status server request in

931
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,020
radius but that only goes one hop you

932
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,599
can only send it to that that first

933
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,780
server that you talk to that you have

934
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,900
um a shared secret with uh so you can

935
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,940
query the health of that server of that

936
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,700
proxy there's no way to query the health

937
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,180
of the more remote proxy that's multiple

938
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,660
hops away from you so there's no ping

939
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,079
that would go across multiple Hops and

940
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,000
then also there's no way to trace the

941
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,579
paths that a request would take to see

942
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:08,820
if the path is valid or looping or what

943
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,920
um so there's no like trace route like

944
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,760
functionality that we can use

945
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,520
um to debug these problems which ends up

946
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
with people literally calling each other

947
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,000
on the phone and asking them to check

948
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,579
their locks that's that's how you you

949
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,820
debug a multi-hop radius routing problem

950
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,260
today

951
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,180
um so next slide

952
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,560
there are also some security challenges

953
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,900
you know

954
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,880
eduroma is a security service and it's

955
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,820
based on radius and radius is

956
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,820
good and works well but its message

957
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,220
protection is pretty Antiquated by

958
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,020
today's standards and this comes up

959
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,880
sometimes when you talk to people about

960
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,200
Edge Rome

961
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,880
um it consists of pairwise shared

962
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,579
secrets and an md5 hash for message

963
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:57,780
protection

964
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,579
and

965
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,640
um the shared secrets are often typed by

966
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,980
administrators into a UI or a plain text

967
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,000
file

968
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,940
there's no consistently enforced minimal

969
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,000
length for those keys nor is there any

970
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,920
requirement for cryptographic generation

971
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,180
of those

972
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,460
those shared secrets and there's no

973
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,040
algorithm agility for the md5 hash and I

974
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,339
think this came up in the the buff on on

975
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,980
Monday although when I first started

976
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,420
working on these slides and talking to

977
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,460
you guys the buff wasn't even a glimmer

978
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,700
in in Alan's eye as far as I know so

979
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,779
um next slide

980
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,579
uh there's also a trade-off that our our

981
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:42,660
subscribing institutions run into

982
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,300
between privacy

983
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,119
and secondary credentials now

984
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,280
there's no reason in the world that

985
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,839
there's an inherent trade-off between

986
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,820
privacy and secondary credentials but

987
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,940
there is in

988
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,839
um Eep over radius and the reason it has

989
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,839
to do more with what's available for

990
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,300
methods than it does with any

991
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,160
technological reason why it has to be

992
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,480
this way

993
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,700
user privacy is absolutely essential in

994
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,820
edurome because the risk is exposing the

995
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,040
physical location of an end user

996
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,320
right you're not going to expose the

997
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,700
fact that they went to this website

998
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,920
you're going to expose the fact that

999
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,140
they're in a particular room at this

1000
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,720
time so some of the people in the SAG

1001
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,839
room are on edge room

1002
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,599
their home institution can actually tell

1003
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,320
where they are physically located

1004
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,480
um

1005
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,619
you can't see the signaling in the room

1006
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,240
I was raising my hand as were a couple

1007
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,220
of others in the room on that wireless

1008
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,780
network

1009
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,579
so

1010
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:48,780
um

1011
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,060
but you know you wouldn't want

1012
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,220
a possible attackers to be able to

1013
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,140
figure that out possibly not even the

1014
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,280
I.T people at your home institution but

1015
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,300
you know

1016
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,640
uh but there are issues

1017
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,920
with that which I'll talk about and then

1018
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,680
the other desirable thing that you want

1019
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,599
in Edge Aroma is the use of secondary

1020
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,619
credentials so such as certificates or

1021
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,780
maybe derived credentials I'm not

1022
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,820
talking about

1023
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,960
multi-factor you might want that too but

1024
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,180
that's a whole nother question

1025
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,560
um that maybe I should have put on these

1026
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,680
slides but I did not but um secondary

1027
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,660
credentials such as certificates can be

1028
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,520
valuable to allow passwordless

1029
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,079
Authentication

1030
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,839
or to protect protect primary

1031
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,280
credentials

1032
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,940
from being used in an environment where

1033
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,839
the

1034
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,820
where they might be exposed out on the

1035
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,040
internet so

1036
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,660
um so you know your user may have

1037
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,460
primary credentials they use for logging

1038
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,460
into University services but you don't

1039
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,740
want them to use that same credential to

1040
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,880
use Edge your own because they're going

1041
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,980
to go out and use that

1042
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,119
credential and Starbucks or whatever so

1043
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,760
um people want both of those things but

1044
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,960
there's a trade-off Peep and ttls

1045
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,599
are pretty good on the Privacy side you

1046
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,460
well as long as you configure it right

1047
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,160
you can use an anonymous username in the

1048
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,319
outer method so that the username

1049
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,720
portion is only ever transmitted over an

1050
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,520
encrypted tunnel

1051
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,319
so that's pretty good you can't

1052
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,040
necessarily tell where a person is

1053
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,420
TLS is pretty good for secondary

1054
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,260
credentials but the username is exposed

1055
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,480
in plain text in the unencrypted client

1056
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,940
certificate

1057
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,800
um so there's a couple ways you could go

1058
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,440
to try to fix this one is that you could

1059
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,000
support

1060
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,599
TLS 1.3 and eptls so that the

1061
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,579
certificate would be encrypted

1062
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,579
or have wider use of radzsec to encrypt

1063
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:51,900
the whole session

1064
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,960
and that would those would meet both

1065
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,579
requirements

1066
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,040
but those are also both pki Solutions

1067
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,900
there's and there's some people who

1068
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,359
don't want pki Solutions which is why we

1069
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,140
see

1070
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,020
Peep and ttls combined being

1071
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,079
a much larger deployment at least in the

1072
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,780
US than eptls

1073
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,240
um but there I don't know of any

1074
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,540
combination of currently

1075
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,819
available methods that would give you

1076
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,380
both of those things

1077
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,380
in a non-pki

1078
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,560
solution so so that's where we are we

1079
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,780
don't actually

1080
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,760
have any of those things fully today

1081
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,540
like rad sex informational and uh Eep

1082
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,359
TLS 1.3

1083
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,579
I I don't I think there's been some talk

1084
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:42,960
about that but it's not in

1085
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,359
implementations and I don't even think

1086
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,740
we have a

1087
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,260
a draft that would offer a non-pki

1088
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,819
solution that would let you do both of

1089
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:56,099
these things at once so next slide

1090
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,460
we ran into some operational challenges

1091
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,160
as well I talked about looping it's the

1092
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,500
most frequent cause of just dropped

1093
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,040
requests there's no way to there's so

1094
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,780
many things you can't

1095
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,940
say in radius right there's no way to

1096
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,880
send error messages so we just have to

1097
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,319
drop the request this is not really a

1098
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,440
way to go back and say you were looping

1099
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,339
um

1100
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,480
also because

1101
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,579
you don't end up you don't want the

1102
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:28,680
response to end up looping as well

1103
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,940
um

1104
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,540
and we have a way that we notice looping

1105
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,940
with a vendor attribute other people

1106
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,099
have other ways of noticing looping

1107
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,800
usually requiring a vendor specific

1108
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,480
attribute

1109
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,380
um

1110
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,560
but uh there's no standard method for

1111
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,500
detecting looping or letting another

1112
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,500
server know that

1113
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,599
anything's looping

1114
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:55,200
um

1115
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,200
also separate issue many clients will

1116
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,880
retry a failed connection request

1117
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,099
immediately with the same credentials

1118
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,760
so they they get back and access reject

1119
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,099
and they just try again uh we had one

1120
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,280
example that involved 37 000 requests

1121
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,020
every five minutes until the manual

1122
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,280
intervention at the service location

1123
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,760
um they had a comma edu at the end of

1124
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,060
their realm instead of a DOT at you and

1125
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,859
their supplicant just tried to

1126
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:29,359
authenticate as fast as it could

1127
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,339
37 000 times every five minutes until

1128
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,140
somebody went and blocked that

1129
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,920
particular user

1130
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,780
um I don't know why that's the case and

1131
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:43,319
would like to figure out if there's

1132
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:44,880
something better that we could say that

1133
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,880
would get them to back off or stop

1134
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,160
um we get a lot of people who have long

1135
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,319
expired or obsolete credentials still

1136
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,180
configured on their devices

1137
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,300
like you might say why 35

1138
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,400
error rate those aren't proxying errors

1139
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,920
those are the IDP saying no those

1140
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,960
credentials are not

1141
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,619
um

1142
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,800
valid and most of the time that's

1143
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,619
because they're obsolete or uh expired

1144
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:14,579
um

1145
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,380
and

1146
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,700
um

1147
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,819
there's no way to signal for the IDP to

1148
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:22,200
signal to the device that those

1149
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,420
credentials need to be invalidated

1150
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,140
uh supplicants will try to use obviously

1151
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,300
bogus credentials

1152
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,599
um you know Realms with comma edu in

1153
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,119
them things with no realm things with

1154
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,420
white space or special characters in

1155
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,300
in the username or the realm missing

1156
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,880
Realms expired certs like there's not

1157
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,339
supplicants aren't doing anything to try

1158
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:48,839
to decide if this is a reasonable

1159
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,480
request before sending it which is

1160
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,420
frustrating because we get a lot of

1161
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,359
those as well that I think was third

1162
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,480
down on the list of reasons why we have

1163
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,200
to throw away requests and then the last

1164
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,020
one I have and I've tried to research

1165
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,240
this to some extent is that we receive

1166
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,420
many Quest requests per second

1167
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,920
with Realms of the form

1168
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,780
wland.mnc3

1169
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,680
numbers.mcc3 numbers

1170
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,260
Dot

1171
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,180
3gppnetwork.org and as far as I can tell

1172
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,359
we are somehow being mistaken for a 3gpp

1173
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,400
carrier network but I can't figure out

1174
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,099
how to make it stop so those are my

1175
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,680
random you know leftover operational

1176
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,560
challenges that that we see pretty much

1177
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,700
every day

1178
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,300
um

1179
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,540
so the next slide

1180
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,400
uh there is some ongoing progress

1181
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,500
because since I originally offered to

1182
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,819
make this presentation in the spring and

1183
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,560
um well I didn't even and I had coven

1184
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,060
during the last meeting so that wouldn't

1185
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,800
have worked out at all

1186
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,060
um

1187
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,819
some work has been proposed in the ietf

1188
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:02,099
in some cases by us because we've been

1189
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:03,720
talking about these issues and said well

1190
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,040
we could

1191
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,440
write a draft

1192
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,760
that would address some of the issues

1193
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,560
that we've encountered

1194
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,119
um some of them are in the rad extra

1195
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:15,599
boff and the the radx tree chartering

1196
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,020
effort and then also um Josh talked

1197
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,260
about eat guy and emu but some of the

1198
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,040
things that we're struggling with aren't

1199
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,180
actually

1200
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,160
being worked on anywhere

1201
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,599
um

1202
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,140
and you know would I would be interested

1203
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,540
at least in in trying to contribute if

1204
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,460
somebody had a good way to solve some of

1205
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,960
those problems

1206
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,420
um next slide

1207
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,000
so these are the three people who talked

1208
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,280
about this presentation

1209
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,119
um as it was uh under development

1210
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:51,960
um

1211
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,060
it's just our own observations and

1212
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,920
opinions it doesn't represent the views

1213
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
of internet too certainly not of

1214
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,839
edrome.org who none of us work for or

1215
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:02,520
any other company company or

1216
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,220
organization so there you have it those

1217
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,020
are

1218
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,800
thoughts on

1219
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,060
on deploying Eep and radius in a great

1220
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,900
big

1221
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,500
multi-level proxy application

1222
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,839
so I think the next slide asks if

1223
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,240
there's any questions

1224
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,119
so thank you Margaret this is um as the

1225
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,099
buff chair for the red extra group this

1226
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,540
is extremely helpful and you've

1227
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,460
basically done most of my homework on on

1228
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,319
making various evaluations on whether

1229
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,000
it's a good idea to open this group or

1230
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,819
not so thank you very much

1231
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,220
a very interesting talk about about

1232
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,619
existing technology and how it evolves

1233
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,619
and the problems and and so are there

1234
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:45,720
any questions comments from people in

1235
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,920
the room

1236
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,240
yeah

1237
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,880
yeah

1238
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,119
hi Jan Freddie room Enthusiast and uh

1239
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,819
National roaming operator in Germany

1240
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,460
um Margaret you talked about

1241
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,880
um load balancing and failover

1242
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,300
mechanisms um in Germany we had tried

1243
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,740
that once but

1244
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,460
failed uh spectacularly because uh of

1245
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,440
course there are the two layers radius

1246
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,460
and EAP and if you don't recognize the

1247
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,740
the EAP layer and you just distribute

1248
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,220
the radius then you end up with failed

1249
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,380
authentication requests how do you deal

1250
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,400
with that

1251
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,579
we are just load balancing based on IP

1252
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:33,180
address so uh a particular

1253
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,220
um

1254
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,959
you know SP will

1255
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,740
the S yeah a particular SP all their

1256
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,480
requests will go

1257
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,319
um to the same

1258
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,000
internal server which does mean we don't

1259
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,520
get perfect load balancing because

1260
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,859
some are busier than others and if we're

1261
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,900
unlucky that day we may get two-thirds

1262
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,220
of the traffic going to one and

1263
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,660
one-third of the traffic going to the

1264
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,920
other uh until some event occurs where

1265
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,680
um both those those machines um are

1266
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,619
constantly monitored and restarted if if

1267
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:12,839
something goes wrong with them so or and

1268
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,119
sometimes they were booted for

1269
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,059
operational reasons updates uh stuff

1270
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:21,359
like that so um

1271
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,460
we don't get perfect load balancing but

1272
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,920
we do it all on IP address rather than

1273
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,440
trying to do anything out of the radius

1274
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,240
or eat because it's

1275
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,859
not

1276
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:32,700
um

1277
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,240
or even the ports because we end up with

1278
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,480
if we do that we end up with traffic

1279
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,500
um

1280
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,380
I mentioned for people who aren't aware

1281
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,180
of what he's talking about that there

1282
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,460
are several exchanges for each

1283
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,980
authentication those exchanges have to

1284
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,420
go through the same proxy because the

1285
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,359
proxy has State uh so basically we're

1286
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:56,520
we're doing just a much

1287
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,119
um

1288
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,520
sort of uh

1289
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,280
course or grade load balancing in order

1290
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,920
to avoid those problems

1291
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,380
okay did you did you look to to do

1292
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,599
something with a username for example or

1293
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,900
the the MAC address of the uh device the

1294
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,520
calling station ID

1295
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,440
we have

1296
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,200
mentioned that in meetings but we

1297
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,180
haven't needed to do that in order to

1298
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,319
get

1299
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,160
um

1300
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,819
the

1301
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,119
the redundancy that we need or we were

1302
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:35,420
having some trouble with uh the entire

1303
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,400
portion of especially on the East Coast

1304
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,839
because more people use the East Coast

1305
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,339
servers on the west coast server for

1306
00:53:41,339 --> 00:53:42,960
some reason

1307
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,760
um having all of the stuff people sent

1308
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,280
to the east coast IP address going to

1309
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,760
one AWS was we were running into

1310
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,040
non-protocol related problems load

1311
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,760
problems and so this what we're doing

1312
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,579
now is enough to actually make

1313
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,140
um make the load low enough that we're

1314
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,900
not running into those problems so so we

1315
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,660
haven't sophisticated

1316
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,339
Mark Donnelly is payment security here

1317
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:10,619
we've also tried to avoid deep packet

1318
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:12,540
inspection for fear of performance

1319
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,440
problems okay and so we as Margaret said

1320
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,020
we've determined that the the uh Source

1321
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,599
IP address is sufficient for us okay

1322
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,500
thank you very much

1323
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:28,559
Leaf I think you said you're having some

1324
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,059
issues putting yourself in the queue

1325
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,880
anyways

1326
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,660
all right

1327
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,599
whatever uh I was gonna come oh thanks

1328
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:51,119
lifesaver thank you

1329
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,920
um

1330
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,079
um yeah so the what I was going to come

1331
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:56,880
up here and say is that if we're looking

1332
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,559
at sort of things where the ITF could

1333
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,000
actually help

1334
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,700
um in this space right there's another

1335
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,200
uh kind of even more pressing problem

1336
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,700
and that's kind of the lack of

1337
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,980
onboarding and provisioning mechanisms

1338
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,400
for for endpoints um in large-scale

1339
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,859
deployments of Wi-Fi and Elliot actually

1340
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,200
brought this up at in a couple of places

1341
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,420
including in in scheme of all places

1342
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,220
because he's kind of has this idea of

1343
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,380
using skim as an onboarding protocol for

1344
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,720
endpoints which might seem a little bit

1345
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,819
odd but it I mean there are there are

1346
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:28,740
kind of reasons for that that he's

1347
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,720
talked about but in any case I mean

1348
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,780
today if you're deploying Wi-Fi at scale

1349
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,119
um it it is and you're not doing mobile

1350
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,000
management right then doing something

1351
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,859
like crossword cross domain cross

1352
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,780
everything right

1353
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,599
um it is a challenge because platforms

1354
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,500
do not align here they don't share

1355
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,140
um like common apis common models even

1356
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,420
anywhere remotely common capabilities

1357
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,280
and that's a problem for logical rollout

1358
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,540
yeah that's I think the big

1359
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,700
gers I I guess I didn't mention it

1360
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,579
because I you know

1361
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,579
don't play product managers on TV or

1362
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:13,740
anything but you know if you like talk

1363
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:18,240
to our subscribers that's the biggest

1364
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,880
problem that they have is how to onboard

1365
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,400
the users to eduro

1366
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,800
um and uh

1367
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,319
if we could come up with a solution that

1368
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,599
would actually make that easy that that

1369
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,760
would help with deployment

1370
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,079
um it might help

1371
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,180
uh radius need be used in other

1372
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,579
large-scale deployments where that might

1373
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:40,619
be an even bigger issue I might

1374
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:42,720
mentioned on a slide but didn't say that

1375
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,359
in the US at least we're moving to K-12

1376
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,200
and

1377
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,220
and

1378
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,500
um

1379
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,619
libraries museums Etc uh not like not

1380
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:54,480
research institution libraries but just

1381
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,839
regular libraries and um that also has

1382
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,900
challenges in that area because those

1383
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,599
places have even less

1384
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,660
um

1385
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,720
it support help desk support Etc than

1386
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,980
than a small University

1387
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,260
Paul Hoffman playing tourists here

1388
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,760
Margaret you just said something that

1389
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,099
scares the crap out of me as somebody is

1390
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:25,200
a good friend of somebody who works in

1391
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,079
the public library in Santa Cruz who

1392
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,119
already has plenty of issues because the

1393
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,240
public library is basically the internet

1394
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,520
connection point for the large homeless

1395
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,500
population that we have

1396
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,740
doing onboarding as they do now is

1397
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,359
already rough

1398
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:43,559
um yeah

1399
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,660
I haven't been inside in a long time but

1400
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,640
boy would I encourage people who are

1401
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,319
thinking where are hard problems that

1402
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,240
touch end users as compared to the

1403
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,819
network to work on this if this comes to

1404
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:56,400
them there will be an expectation

1405
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,839
because they already do free internet

1406
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,760
service through local internet service

1407
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,380
provider and stuff

1408
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,420
um helping them out would would be like

1409
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,040
a huge thing I mean like I hear her

1410
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,619
complain to me reasonably often that you

1411
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,660
know she spends a long time filling out

1412
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,400
forms for people who just need to get on

1413
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,680
the internet for 10 minutes to see

1414
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,420
whether they have a place to sleep that

1415
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,099
night so

1416
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:20,520
um please yes onboarding well this came

1417
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,040
up a lot with children out of school

1418
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,059
um

1419
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,460
for covet at least in the U.S as well

1420
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:31,040
that they would you know

1421
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,780
end up outside like Taco Bell or

1422
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,079
something trying to get on the internet

1423
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,880
so there's a big desire to get all those

1424
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,680
school children on edge room and have a

1425
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,780
lot of Ed your own service points so

1426
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,859
that if something like that happened

1427
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:46,799
again the they'd have somewhere to go to

1428
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,000
get

1429
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,140
free internet access

1430
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,819
okay

1431
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:58,020
um so there's no more further questions

1432
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,780
so thank you very much Margaret

1433
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:05,359
and we'll go on to our next item

1434
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:10,700
um which I believe is the HTTP note

1435
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:16,400
oh the formal proof item yeah

1436
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,619
so we're switching uh to the next uh

1437
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:23,220
topic which we hope

1438
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,380
will be a little more uh we'll be

1439
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,420
interactive because we want to get

1440
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,260
feedback from uh from the group so the

1441
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,480
key up is that we in the security area

1442
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,020
have relied on outside help to do formal

1443
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,760
verification of security properties

1444
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,380
across a number of working groups

1445
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,839
frankly to a lot of great success so if

1446
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,359
we think about the Tron Workshop that

1447
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:50,579
helped us do formal verification that

1448
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,520
helped us uh bring academics in that are

1449
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,280
doing formal verification for tls13 if

1450
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,520
we think about in in uh in Lake for the

1451
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,720
ad hoc protocol if we think about IP

1452
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,339
components of ipsec if we think about

1453
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:09,240
MLS I am sure in oauth in nap so I'm

1454
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,799
sure I've forgotten uh kind of a couple

1455
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,540
of them we've had really great success

1456
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,780
to do one of two things first uh it has

1457
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,040
helped us find things deep

1458
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,960
vulnerabilities that we would not have

1459
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,020
otherwise uh found it has also helped us

1460
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,880
the other way which is again gave us a

1461
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,980
little bit more confidence that what

1462
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,799
we're gonna what we're about to publish

1463
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:30,839
for broad scale adoption and operation

1464
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:33,359
uh has the properties we hope that it

1465
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,859
have that we wouldn't have otherwise

1466
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:36,960
found even with large-scale uh

1467
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,440
large-scale kind of interop

1468
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,359
something that happened after 114 was

1469
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:45,299
really the recognition by the ads that

1470
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:48,180
that practice while prevalent uh in SEC

1471
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,339
for for big things is actually not

1472
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:51,960
something that occurs very all that

1473
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,079
often outside of the security area uh

1474
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,540
and kind of really the question is okay

1475
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,160
that's not kind of unusual to have to

1476
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,960
take in our different practices but we

1477
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,720
have a really kind of nice method to

1478
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,700
give us a little bit more security kind

1479
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,940
of assurance and when would we want to

1480
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,160
really apply it fully recognizing that

1481
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,900
we don't have a lot of that expertise

1482
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,940
here in the iitf so how do we Bridge

1483
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,799
perhaps the communities that can do that

1484
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,660
formal verification

1485
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,640
the other motivation for this is that

1486
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,880
there's an activity in Flight uh in the

1487
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,339
irtf uh there's an initiative very much

1488
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:27,720
how we have a charter and kind of

1489
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,040
process to create new working groups

1490
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,660
there is a proposal in Flight in the

1491
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,059
irtf to spin up a group kind of more

1492
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:34,980
broadly that helps us think how to

1493
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,460
formally specify uh ITF protocols and

1494
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,839
one sub component of that would be

1495
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,059
specification that would allow us to do

1496
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:45,119
this class of formal verification uh and

1497
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,160
you know not to cut a very very kind of

1498
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,900
future stuff Justin Richard is here

1499
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,579
because he's going to be talking to us

1500
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:53,640
about HTTP signatures which is actually

1501
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,520
at a vhdp business which is actually the

1502
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,079
the document that started this

1503
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,299
conversation because art came to kind of

1504
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,579
second set wow during working group last

1505
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:04,500
call there was a question of whether

1506
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,660
this was formally verified well sec I

1507
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,059
mean is that a requirement uh and we

1508
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,799
said well in fact it is done quite

1509
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,720
commonly but it is not kind of a

1510
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,180
requirement and really wanted to get uh

1511
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,040
you know some feedback on the mic should

1512
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,079
we push this more should we try to urge

1513
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:20,819
these communities more where there would

1514
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:23,160
be cases where we want to push more

1515
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,099
strongly to to kind of get this and

1516
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:27,900
really solicit if there are folks in the

1517
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,640
room what do you think we can do who do

1518
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,540
you think can kind of help us

1519
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,880
we welcome opinions and feedback

1520
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,520
I can tell you what sector we asked the

1521
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,680
same question at sector if you're kind

1522
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,540
of thinking if you have an opinion is

1523
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,020
the recognition that this is helpful

1524
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:51,180
concern that how do we get the help uh

1525
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,220
the help that's needed and the caution

1526
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,099
that formal verification is not a magic

1527
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:58,079
kind of bullet that will kind of find

1528
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,859
everything in anything

1529
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,240
so I see Philip at the top of the queue

1530
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,899
you're up

1531
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,680
Phillip

1532
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,220
you got your video ah right sorry

1533
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,680
okay yeah

1534
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,220
I I I'm a big fan of formal methods I

1535
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,799
did do formal methods for a doctor at

1536
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,420
Once Upon a Time

1537
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,099
uh

1538
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:40,319
uh the thing that does worry me a little

1539
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,380
bit is that when we're using formal

1540
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,960
methods in the cryptographic algorithm

1541
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,160
space

1542
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,299
we're actually using one set of tools

1543
01:03:50,299 --> 01:03:53,339
and that set of tools is not necessarily

1544
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:55,200
the set of tools that will be relevant

1545
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,680
to the protocol work that we do

1546
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,299
uh

1547
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:02,700
it's in some ways it's a more advanced

1548
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,059
set of tools but we're looking at

1549
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:09,839
uh can somebody break this not how does

1550
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,420
this go wrong and so it's slightly

1551
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,559
different

1552
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:16,380
uh I do have a bunch of tools that I use

1553
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,480
that are not quite formal methods I use

1554
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,359
domain-specific languages to design a

1555
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:25,760
lot of my stuff

1556
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,980
uh and it might be that we could

1557
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,319
find a way of going from a

1558
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:35,640
domain-specific language uh that is uh

1559
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,140
optimized for ietf protocol design

1560
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,599
that would generate the proof of the

1561
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:45,059
protocol along with the protocol code

1562
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:47,640
and specification

1563
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,000
uh that is probably more practical as an

1564
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,640
expectation than expecting people to do

1565
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,579
mathematical proofs of protocols which

1566
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:00,720
to be honest I've not done in 25 years

1567
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,119
I've not done that since I uh got my

1568
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,880
doctorate I don't think that many other

1569
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,839
folk do that willingly uh you know

1570
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,980
unless you've got a grad student

1571
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:15,599
we we have heard kind of similar

1572
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,760
feedback uh you know I think both both

1573
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,420
themes one which is uh when we say

1574
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,040
formal methods and formal verification

1575
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,780
it covers quite a lot of different kind

1576
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,460
of practices and it's you know you got

1577
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,780
to be really clear on what properties

1578
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,460
you're really kind of talking about and

1579
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,920
we have equally heard that that is not a

1580
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,960
set of expertise we have in the IHF and

1581
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,880
we completely appreciate that to me I

1582
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,040
see I'll speak for myself I see this as

1583
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,900
a bridging exercise about how to reach

1584
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,420
that Community thanks

1585
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,859
Justin

1586
01:05:43,859 --> 01:05:45,839
yeah so I actually wanted to Justin

1587
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,000
Richard I wanted to talk about

1588
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,599
um

1589
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,640
sort of some of the experience that

1590
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,319
we've had with this with oauth and gonna

1591
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,480
have and things like that which uh to

1592
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,619
Phil's point it was through grad

1593
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,000
students

1594
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,579
um you know there are some uh some great

1595
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:01,200
Master's thesis have come have come out

1596
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,559
of this work uh one of the difficult

1597
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,839
things with these multi-party multi-step

1598
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,940
and especially staple protocols and

1599
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,540
trying to model them is that uh a lot of

1600
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,980
times

1601
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,980
the assumptions of sort of who knows

1602
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,960
what piece of information is really at

1603
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,119
at any given time is really difficult to

1604
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,640
model within the tools uh because the

1605
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,000
the tools generally tend to have a much

1606
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,520
more sort of simplified model of a

1607
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,440
connects to B therefore a can talk to B

1608
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,859
and um and things like that

1609
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:38,900
um the other challenge that we found is

1610
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,819
uh we've had grad students come running

1611
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,039
up to us and saying things did you know

1612
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:46,619
that Bearer tokens can be shared between

1613
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:49,160
people and then you can use them

1614
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:54,660
and the entire working group said yes

1615
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,280
um and so

1616
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,140
that type of like we we know that that

1617
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:04,319
is a very significant you know trade-off

1618
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,240
uh in the space being able to

1619
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,700
communicate that so that a grad student

1620
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,160
doesn't spend a month modeling that

1621
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,660
Bearer tokens can be shared between

1622
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,900
parties and uh and actually spends time

1623
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,480
finding sort of the more subtle

1624
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,079
interconnection uh problems which have I

1625
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,780
will say been very very useful uh to get

1626
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,280
that kind of feedback

1627
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,400
so uh I I support there being

1628
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,240
sort of more of an ongoing liaison or

1629
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,380
onboarding or some type of relationship

1630
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,640
whereby that institutional knowledge

1631
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,400
that's in the ITF of like we kind of

1632
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,380
like these are our assumptions about the

1633
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,819
space that the protocol lives in the

1634
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:46,260
kind of stuff that you write down in

1635
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,880
security considerations

1636
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,160
versus the institutional knowledge of

1637
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,559
this is what the tools can model and how

1638
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,059
they model those different things and

1639
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:56,000
connecting those things together

1640
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,140
uh connecting those two sides together

1641
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,839
is uh is difficult but I think probably

1642
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,000
worthwhile in a lot of cases

1643
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,039
okay thanks Justin sort of quickly

1644
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,420
summarize I mean you're saying that

1645
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,640
you've had good experiences and two two

1646
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,160
working groups you're cautioning us that

1647
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,200
you really do need to help on board or

1648
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,140
bootstrap absolutely folks and you know

1649
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,399
this is one of the many things we might

1650
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:19,500
need to do for bridging yes absolutely

1651
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,380
thank you uh so just managing strictly

1652
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,939
by who's in the queue I think Joe you

1653
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:25,560
are next

1654
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,319
so swap with Mike

1655
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,120
uh Joe salary

1656
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,520
um and I think Justin kind of said a lot

1657
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,799
of the things I was going to say but one

1658
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,960
of the values of of doing some of these

1659
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,698
things isn't even maybe in the formal

1660
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,380
analysis which is important but just

1661
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,660
getting to the point of knowing what

1662
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,880
assumptions you're making and and

1663
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,460
documenting what you're what your

1664
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,738
security properties you want can be

1665
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:51,540
incredibly useful and something that we

1666
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,100
don't always do even in the security

1667
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,380
area but outside of the security area

1668
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,359
that's one of the things I'd like to see

1669
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,000
more of in security considerations right

1670
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
is a little bit better analysis of what

1671
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,040
it is we actually want and what

1672
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,359
assumptions we're making

1673
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,040
and you'll have that's going to be the

1674
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,660
first step in your formal verification

1675
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:13,319
anyway or should be I think

1676
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,399
thanks Joe Mike

1677
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,080
Ellsworth so I have exactly the same

1678
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,759
comment that Joseph just made but from

1679
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:22,679
the I don't really know how to do this

1680
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:23,819
angle

1681
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:26,819
um so if you're going to can flirt with

1682
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:29,520
mandating this in security standards do

1683
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,020
we have like a prereq is going to have

1684
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,960
to be a really good how-to document what

1685
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,000
to what debts do you need to document

1686
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,939
your assumptions to what depth you need

1687
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:40,738
to document your requirements what's the

1688
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:42,660
formal language for doing so and for

1689
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,219
people who've never done formal modeling

1690
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:45,839
that's going to have to be you know

1691
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,939
brain dead simple laid out so that the

1692
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:49,259
tools are going to you know work well

1693
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:50,698
for people who don't really have a

1694
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:53,160
background in this

1695
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,500
uh so if I quickly summarize I I think

1696
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,260
what you're saying is uh be very careful

1697
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,239
with how much formalism you put on top

1698
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,500
of it there is an onboarding problem

1699
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,860
uh Peter Peter Castleman um so uh I

1700
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,420
participate in the oauth working group

1701
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,300
in a few other places uh similar to

1702
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,160
Justin's comment we've you know we've

1703
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,600
used this in a number of places we're

1704
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,580
looking at using it for analyzing some

1705
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,199
of the issues that we see with what we

1706
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:24,540
call cross device protocols

1707
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,340
uh one of the things that I would sort

1708
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,140
of caution or one a few things to think

1709
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,140
about is around education uh also for

1710
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,600
people who are relying or hearing that

1711
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,580
there was a formal analysis of this

1712
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,440
protocol they don't necessarily

1713
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,880
understand that you know there's a set

1714
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,040
of assumptions there's a set of models

1715
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,699
even around the attacker Etc and if you

1716
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:47,040
don't understand that it's the proof can

1717
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,320
very easily be taken out of context or

1718
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,820
misunderstood right so I think some

1719
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,679
education on that side

1720
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:55,260
the other thing is the limitations of

1721
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,500
the the the process itself so some of

1722
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,179
the problems that we see

1723
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:00,840
um

1724
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,300
you know I think it's it's not very good

1725
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,940
at modeling human behavior where we have

1726
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,800
humans that participate in the protocol

1727
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,440
it's not very good or we I haven't seen

1728
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,480
good instances maybe that's a challenge

1729
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,960
and opportunity for uh practitioners is

1730
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,699
to start thinking about how do we also

1731
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:20,280
model uh human decision making in in

1732
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,900
this process as well so maybe there's an

1733
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,239
opportunity to help Advance the field

1734
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,060
but be cautious about the limits of the

1735
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,340
mechanisms but overall very supportive

1736
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,600
of this

1737
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,820
uh thank you insert to reiterate I think

1738
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,980
the unique caution you uh you just gave

1739
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,679
us is to remind folks to not falsely for

1740
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,540
on the ITF side that are developing the

1741
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,100
protocols not to put too much

1742
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,840
necessarily

1743
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,360
did you consider what really the proof

1744
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,980
in the models will bring back to you and

1745
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:49,260
not not make assumptions there so from

1746
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,880
the other thing that uh Mike and Justin

1747
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,500
were talking about

1748
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,120
um

1749
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,340
my personal experience on this is you

1750
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,719
need a professor

1751
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,340
who is interested in your work and

1752
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,739
informal proofs and it happens at a time

1753
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:07,679
frame when it's at the beginning of the

1754
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,219
term when he can tag a master students

1755
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:13,199
or two to do it

1756
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,940
and we are now actually having this

1757
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:17,400
happening in in drip that that that Dr

1758
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,100
gertoff has a student actually doing the

1759
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,400
formal proof because uh he needed

1760
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,260
he needs things for his students of

1761
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,000
course and he's been working with us for

1762
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,300
for years he knows his stuff so um we're

1763
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,880
getting it done but it was because of

1764
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,500
all these circumstances falling together

1765
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,080
and back in the spring he didn't have

1766
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,820
the students assigned to it now here in

1767
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,580
the fall at the beginning of the term he

1768
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,440
was able to sign a student to it so it's

1769
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,140
like you have to be references of it you

1770
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,100
got to have someone who's capable of

1771
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,320
doing it and have the resources to do it

1772
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,780
and the timing to do it and maybe you'll

1773
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,219
get it done

1774
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:56,340
yeah the big the big takeaway I I uh I'm

1775
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,900
hearing is the reminder that we don't

1776
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,940
have that expertise as native in the

1777
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:03,019
ietf right

1778
01:13:03,239 --> 01:13:05,340
Florence

1779
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,760
hi um so yeah broadly in favor of doing

1780
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,320
something and I think a lot of really

1781
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,659
good things have been said um about like

1782
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:14,400
us this may be encouraging us to

1783
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,020
document our security assumptions when

1784
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,340
writing properties that's right

1785
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,560
protocols that's a good thing not seeing

1786
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,300
this as a silver bullet um the thing I

1787
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,540
was going to add is if we're kind of we

1788
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,860
really want this to happen we really

1789
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,600
want form verification of Standards then

1790
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,280
there's probably also something that we

1791
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,380
could do at the protocol writing stage

1792
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,080
of how do the ITF right protocols that

1793
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:34,920
are

1794
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,199
kind of conducive to being formally

1795
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,820
verified

1796
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,320
um I don't know anything about that but

1797
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,640
I'm sure there's a big community that do

1798
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,679
out there

1799
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,020
yeah good good point that there's

1800
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,060
additional work we can do to set the set

1801
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,640
the stage here uh next in the queue is

1802
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,460
Paul I think I'm sorry not Peter you can

1803
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,440
be Paul some other time

1804
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,679
um so with the last couple of comments

1805
01:13:58,679 --> 01:13:59,340
um

1806
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:03,300
it seems I don't this may be a very

1807
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,280
small thing but a formal proof

1808
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,719
directorate

1809
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,560
similar to the Yang doctors

1810
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:13,020
might be of interest to and when Bob

1811
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,179
said oh grad students and such I always

1812
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:18,000
cringe because I never was one

1813
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,600
um but if there are a pool of grad

1814
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,980
students who are looking for interesting

1815
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,659
work on formal proofs even if they have

1816
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:26,940
nothing to do with the ietf if there's a

1817
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,060
place to put them where we say we will

1818
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,219
be offering you things that we're pretty

1819
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:33,840
sure is interesting that is we've

1820
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,340
already got something happening in the

1821
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,900
working group that may be of interest

1822
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,940
this may be a crazy idea like I say I'm

1823
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,360
not in that but a place where people who

1824
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,800
want to have a I did a formal proof on

1825
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,179
their resume

1826
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:50,219
that we can say they did a formal proof

1827
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,360
on this might be of value

1828
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,679
it's a very concrete suggestion about

1829
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,699
how to integrate uh with our processes

1830
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:02,280
Peter uh yeah just uh building on what

1831
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,040
Bob and Paul this is Peter not Paul uh

1832
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,380
just building on what uh Bob and and

1833
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,380
Paul said I think what what I heard when

1834
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,360
Bob was talking I was thinking this is a

1835
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,320
pipeline

1836
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,199
and so in a way if we can uh we need to

1837
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:18,420
think about building that process that

1838
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,880
integrates with uh where the resources

1839
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,159
are the grad students who are doing this

1840
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:25,380
work and that may take a bit of planning

1841
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,820
but maybe that's sort of another way to

1842
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,380
think about it is that integration

1843
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,600
mechanism you know teeing up these

1844
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,179
projects having institutions uh that

1845
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,400
that we can engage with so that when

1846
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,080
fall comes right there's that

1847
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,880
opportunity for the analysis so maybe

1848
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,640
that's just Just one thought

1849
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,300
yeah thanks all right

1850
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,620
I thought I was going to get the Lost

1851
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,600
work but you'd open the queue again wow

1852
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,880


1853
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,100
um

1854
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,260
you can come back and wrap it up all

1855
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,000
right so um two things if you're gonna

1856
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,320
play with academics you have to

1857
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,880
understand that the academic Work World

1858
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,679
works and there are there are things the

1859
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:03,239
ITF does not provide that they need

1860
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:05,460
right that we need to pay for work in

1861
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,860
the sense of providing sort of citable

1862
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,020
references for us and stuff that you can

1863
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,659
use in your academic career and my

1864
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:14,280
understanding from talking to computer

1865
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,620
science professors back home do we do do

1866
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,600
not today provide any of those things

1867
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,080
not the AR anrp price and stuff like

1868
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,239
that's kind of it's doing going in that

1869
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,520
direction but that's irkf not iitf right

1870
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,440
if we're bringing this stuff into the

1871
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,300
operational practice of the iitf we have

1872
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,400
to change some stuff and those are

1873
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,860
fairly fundamental things right the fact

1874
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,020
that you contributing to another to a

1875
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,140
draft that is a temporary thing is

1876
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,600
something you can cite and get academic

1877
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,940
brownie points for it's not so not

1878
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:47,760
something we do today right and the the

1879
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,219
director's idea that seems fine but I

1880
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:51,840
think we have to go further

1881
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,860
the risk here is that we bring in you

1882
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,739
know the old academic

1883
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,600
um who happen to be interested in our

1884
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,420
work and then we place these

1885
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,580
requirements on our work and are unable

1886
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,980
to satisfy them right and the the other

1887
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,659
thing that I was going to say is that

1888
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:12,600
you know be Beware of the scoping issue

1889
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,600
and formal verification as other people

1890
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,000
have said right there's this meme that

1891
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,520
goes something like out of scope said no

1892
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,320
attacker ever

1893
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,300
foreign

1894
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,100
that was going to be the last word but

1895
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,199
fair enough and I'm going to jump in

1896
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:31,199
between the recognition that credit is

1897
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,880
really key and the credit as we think

1898
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,739
about on the IDF is not commenced with

1899
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:36,659
what's uh what's often happens in the

1900
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:39,600
academic side uh is my understanding Joe

1901
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,460
May kind of correct me here that's why

1902
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,560
the Tron Workshop was actually created

1903
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,980
uh I think was with IEEE because there

1904
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,239
were there was a ton of academic

1905
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,219
interest in tls13 but again they wanted

1906
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:52,440
to publish at a citable venue that helps

1907
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,120
with tenure and kind of credit and so I

1908
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,620
believe that was Joe if I'm getting

1909
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:58,320
wrong I mean kind of back brief it I'll

1910
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,820
actually I'll stop talking Joe knows

1911
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,380
more about Tron than I do yeah so with

1912
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,920
TLS 1.3 we did hold several workshops in

1913
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,659
coordination with different conferences

1914
01:18:06,659 --> 01:18:09,600
ndss and and a couple other ones and and

1915
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,659
that helped give a venue for people to

1916
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:16,260
be able to uh present their work in a in

1917
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,179
a more academic setting versus a

1918
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:20,780
standards meeting

1919
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,120
okay so we're going to give Benson the

1920
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,480
last word

1921
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,540
that's it if you're talking uh we don't

1922
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,400
hear you you're at the top of the mic

1923
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,560
please turn on your audio and pose your

1924
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,540
comment or question

1925
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:46,199
can you hear me uh we can indeed please

1926
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,340
okay

1927
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,739
um so maybe increasing the visibility

1928
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:52,199
would help uh so some of the projects

1929
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,780
which could be best Master's projects or

1930
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,460
either the Maximus project so things

1931
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,739
used in class

1932
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:01,440
um may also be very good because any of

1933
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,120
the people who would graduate from even

1934
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,620
bachelor's programs and Master's

1935
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,179
programs I would go straight into the

1936
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:08,340
workforce

1937
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:12,179
um and it may not necessarily be work

1938
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:15,179
um that would be considered like

1939
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:18,420
uh publishable or like high credit

1940
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,460
publishable

1941
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,739
um so allowing for those kinds of easier

1942
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:24,360
opportunities and making those visible

1943
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,800
would be I think a very good thing

1944
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,080
especially now that remote participation

1945
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,020
is is much easier

1946
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,199
foreign

1947
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,159
okay uh we're gonna close the close this

1948
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,080
topic I mean we we very much kind of

1949
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,360
thank the feedback from the community

1950
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,880
this was an open-ended open-ended kind

1951
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,739
of call for feedback I mean largely what

1952
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:48,179
I heard and you know you can kind of

1953
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:49,679
correct me if you heard it differently

1954
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,780
kind of Paul is we've we've had past

1955
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,460
experience we heard folks kind of at the

1956
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,620
mic kind of talk about the goodness we

1957
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:58,199
heard the Need For Education

1958
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,300
bootstrapping kind of onboarding on kind

1959
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,940
of both sides if we're gonna leverage

1960
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,560
more of that we may need to do something

1961
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,659
a little bit different with uh with how

1962
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:08,699
we write the write the specs we also

1963
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:10,679
we're cautioned that you know be really

1964
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,480
careful about what would be the

1965
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,880
expectation from what you get on the

1966
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,920
other side we heard a reminder a lot of

1967
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,659
those participants are here at the ITF

1968
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:20,880
uh also they may need some help

1969
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,500
understanding what exactly they would

1970
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,360
need a formal verify whether it's the

1971
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,159
the technical thing to catch or even how

1972
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,080
mechanically they would reach into the

1973
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,960
reach into the the organization and

1974
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,420
recognizing that we hear the IDF may not

1975
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,480
exactly know much about the workflow of

1976
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,219
those uh of those kind of larger

1977
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:39,719
academics and researchers that are

1978
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:42,120
participating what I did not hear is

1979
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,400
anyone going to Mike and say we should

1980
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,800
absolutely not do this and I also didn't

1981
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,780
hear a very strong statement saying

1982
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,820
Roman that should be Roman Paul this

1983
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:53,340
should be table Stakes for you know for

1984
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,199
something kind of in particular I heard

1985
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:58,560
something in the middle uh so I mean we

1986
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,000
really kind of appreciate that feedback

1987
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,980
Richard do you have something quick

1988
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:06,719
oh you were in the queue you're out of

1989
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:10,640
the queue okay go Richard

1990
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:13,739
no okay all right fair enough uh again

1991
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:16,620
we appreciate that feedback uh from I

1992
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,480
think from our perspective there is a

1993
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,820
Groundswell of activity in the irtf that

1994
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,100
I think will very much kind of help us I

1995
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,780
think all the feedback you heard in kind

1996
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,280
of your excitement around this but also

1997
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,840
your caution would be great things to

1998
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,840
give to Colin uh as rgf chair who is

1999
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,640
evaluating whether to spend such a group

2000
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,380
up and I'm sure there are a number of

2001
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,120
proponents pushing that forward I know

2002
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,400
Chris Wood is on the Forefront of some

2003
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,860
of that so I can share some pointers uh

2004
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:44,400
if folks aren't aware in the irtf

2005
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,040
anything else Tampa okay excellent all

2006
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,260
right that brings us to our last formal

2007
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,179
topic uh Justin if you want to come on

2008
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:53,040
up um get your slots

2009
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,760
cheat up

2010
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:00,840
I think we

2011
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,040
so

2012
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,679
I should you should get a prompt for me

2013
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:08,040
to get the clicker control

2014
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,420
yeah

2015
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,880
perfect thank you

2016
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,159
all right hi everybody so uh I'm now

2017
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,120
going to talk about the draft that

2018
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,679
caused all those problems

2019
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:18,780
um

2020
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:21,840
so HTTP message signatures

2021
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,659
um is a draft that is sort of going

2022
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:26,580
through the throes of uh working group

2023
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,400
last call and uh in HTTP I think that's

2024
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,800
an accurate description

2025
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,540
um some Chuckles from the 80s if those

2026
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,100
didn't make it over the mic

2027
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,699
um but uh but basically one of the

2028
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:40,020
interesting things about this document

2029
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,880
for this group is that even though this

2030
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,100
is very much a security focused thing it

2031
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,820
was done in the HTTP space

2032
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,100
um the goal of this document is to

2033
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,159
provide detached signatures for HTTP

2034
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:55,020
messages and specifically things that

2035
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,659
are robust uh signatures that are robust

2036
01:22:57,659 --> 01:23:00,780
against common changes that you see in

2037
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,179
the HTTP space you know headers being

2038
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:04,800
reordered and all sorts of stuff like

2039
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,640
that

2040
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,400
I want to be very clear that this is not

2041
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,679
message encapsulation this is not Ojai

2042
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:14,520
this is not shttp this is not TLS it is

2043
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,560
uh solving

2044
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,940
um a

2045
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,920
different security problem at a

2046
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,260
different sort of uh point of the stack

2047
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,659
um so this is uh it tends to be very

2048
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:27,780
application focused where you have a

2049
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,400
message that you're sending either a

2050
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,340
request or a response and you want to

2051
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,659
make sure that the party on the other

2052
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,280
side knows that you are the one that

2053
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,560
actually sent that specific message

2054
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,440
oh I'm sorry about that I hit the wrong

2055
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,678
button

2056
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,940
so now I'm gonna need to do this this

2057
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:47,540
button again

2058
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,940
yeah the next slide and let go of all

2059
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,380
control buttons are right next to each

2060
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,300
other and they're both huge

2061
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,440
um

2062
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,420
all right so the reason that this is in

2063
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:59,159
the HTTP group and not in any security

2064
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,199
working group is it turns out signing a

2065
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,540
bunch of bits isn't the hard part

2066
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:06,060
dealing with HTTP is a hard part

2067
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:10,980
right HTTP is a super weird protocol uh

2068
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,560
especially as it exists in the wild like

2069
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,100
I did not fully appreciate how weird

2070
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,100
HTTP is until I got involved with this

2071
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,900
work a couple of years ago like I knew

2072
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,360
that it was hard I had kind of invented

2073
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,340
various versions of HTTP message signing

2074
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,500
three different times in the past uh

2075
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,020
before uh before uh starting work on

2076
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,120
this with the HTTP working group and now

2077
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,400
going back I realized that every single

2078
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,380
one of those has

2079
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,679
absolutely horrible gaping holes in them

2080
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:43,560
um in just different ways that HTTP

2081
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:46,500
messages can be legitimately chopped up

2082
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,360
and moved around without changing any of

2083
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,219
the semantics of the message but

2084
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:51,900
changing the bytes that actually go

2085
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,760
across the wire and as we all know

2086
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,800
signatures like dealing with bytes they

2087
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,560
don't like dealing with semantics

2088
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,159
um

2089
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:02,580
so what we needed was a mechanism the

2090
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,560
goal was to have a mechanism where the

2091
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,600
signer and the verifier are seeing

2092
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,360
largely semantically equivalent messages

2093
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,060
that don't look the same so maybe it hit

2094
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,920
an intermediary or it hit an application

2095
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,260
layer or it hit any number of things

2096
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,000
that could move stuff around

2097
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,840
so instead of doing any sort of like

2098
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,820
strict canonicalization or doing an

2099
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,560
encapsulation like those familiar with

2100
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,620
Jose or uh you know tangentially the

2101
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,540
stuff that they're doing with Ojai all

2102
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,159
that's great stuff but what we wanted to

2103
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,860
do instead was to have a common

2104
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,960
signature base that could be generated

2105
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,840
from both of these messages so both from

2106
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,000
the signer side and from the verifiers

2107
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,760
side and I'm not going to go into uh

2108
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,560
great detail right now unless we have a

2109
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,600
lot of questions about uh the mechanics

2110
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,179
of how this works but basically what you

2111
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:54,480
end up with is you create a signature

2112
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,159
based string based off of the message

2113
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:59,280
that you're signing and then you write

2114
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,340
down a um in sort of a very

2115
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,199
deterministic format these are the

2116
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:06,179
things that I signed in this order and

2117
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:08,040
then you hand that whole thing to the

2118
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,719
verifier who can then look at that and

2119
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:11,100
say I'm going to take this same message

2120
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,380
and attempt to create the same signature

2121
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,960
based string and so anything that was

2122
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,159
signed

2123
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:19,139
uh even if it's moved around in the

2124
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:20,639
message I should be able to get the same

2125
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,920
value out and put it in the base string

2126
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,260
in the right spot so that all of our

2127
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,659
crypto Primitives actually work

2128
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:29,400
all right

2129
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,880
so uh very quickly what this looks like

2130
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,520
we've got an HTTP message here we've got

2131
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,679
a few bits that we want to sign

2132
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,320
um so we've got parts of the uh what's

2133
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,239
called the Control Data I learned like

2134
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,280
there's all this esoteric terminology in

2135
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,159
HTTP it's absolutely amazing if you

2136
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:48,900
really really want to know some weird

2137
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,400
stuff buy me a beer and ask me about

2138
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,280
trailers later it is it's it's bizarre

2139
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,120
anyway

2140
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,260
um so what we're going to do here is

2141
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,580
we're going to sign uh part of the

2142
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,440
control data and we're going to assign

2143
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,199
one of the header fields

2144
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,300
and the way that we do that is we say

2145
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,000
that oh and we're signing the method

2146
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,500
um the the font color just didn't show

2147
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,000
up very well

2148
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,159
um so we're signing the method we're

2149
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,620
signing uh the target URI which has a

2150
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,060
sort of a strict formal definition in

2151
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:18,659
HTTP ish in most cases again HTTP is

2152
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:19,980
weird

2153
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:22,199
um and then we're signing a particular

2154
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:24,659
header in this uh very trivial example

2155
01:27:24,659 --> 01:27:26,639
it's the content type header why you

2156
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,080
would want to sign only that I don't

2157
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,260
know but we did here but the important

2158
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:34,080
bit is that this last line the at

2159
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,659
signature params

2160
01:27:35,659 --> 01:27:39,239
this is an ordered list of everything

2161
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:40,980
that I just signed

2162
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,020
including a set of parameters in this

2163
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,639
case a creation timestamp and a key

2164
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:47,219
identifier and what I do is I actually

2165
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:51,060
send that string across the wire now

2166
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,739
we're making use of something called uh

2167
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:55,020
HTTP structured Fields so that even if

2168
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,900
this gets like white spaces around and

2169
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,060
stuff like that this has a formal data

2170
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,520
model to it in a way that most HTTP

2171
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,040
messages the rest of the HTTP message

2172
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,739
kind of doesn't so we can rely on uh

2173
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:09,600
being able to get this signature input

2174
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,639
line in a state that we can actually

2175
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:14,159
parse and we can make sense of and then

2176
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,500
the signature is just a is a binary blob

2177
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,540
again using HTTP structured fields in

2178
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,000
this case to send just uh I think that's

2179
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,940
an RSA signature or something like that

2180
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:26,580
um and that's that's pretty much it you

2181
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:28,739
add these two headers and because they

2182
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:29,820
are what are called dictionary type

2183
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,800
headers you can add multiple signatures

2184
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,840
to a single message which means an

2185
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,760
intermediary that you know is in the

2186
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,100
process can take a look at this validate

2187
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,560
this signature add its own headers sign

2188
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,199
this signature and any additional stuff

2189
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,179
and pass it along which means that

2190
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:46,800
inside of our data centers we now have

2191
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,780
all of these origin servers that are

2192
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,340
several hops removed from the outside

2193
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,440
world can actually validate the message

2194
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,360
that's coming through so really really

2195
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,880
powerful pattern

2196
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,739
uh you can play around with it see how

2197
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:01,980
it works if you go to httpsig.org I

2198
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,500
think it's mostly Upstate except for the

2199
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,179
trailer stuff like I said the trailers

2200
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:08,219
are an absolute mess

2201
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:10,800
um but you can play around with signing

2202
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,179
and verification if you want to see how

2203
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:14,219
it really works and sort of Step through

2204
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:16,440
the the different parts of the process

2205
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,840
but that brings me to why am I here

2206
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,219
today

2207
01:29:20,219 --> 01:29:21,840
we are in working group last call in

2208
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,239
HTTP the HTTP nerds have been chipping

2209
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,920
away at this I don't think any of them

2210
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,360
are in the room here because we're

2211
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,239
meeting opposite of HTTP right now

2212
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:35,340
so yeah great the schedule guys really

2213
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,800
um but uh what we really need at this

2214
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,580
point

2215
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,860
is we need more eyes from the security

2216
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,719
side of things both Annabelle and I the

2217
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,480
the authors on this like most of our

2218
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,880
work we do in the security domain

2219
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,739
um we have an extensive security and

2220
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:51,780
privacy consideration section in this

2221
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:53,159
document

2222
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:54,659
but were enough of Security

2223
01:29:54,659 --> 01:29:56,340
Professionals to know that we probably

2224
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,139
missed some things you know there's some

2225
01:29:58,139 --> 01:29:59,639
subtleties here that we may have not

2226
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:02,940
picked up on and we are calling out to

2227
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:06,540
The Wider SEC Community uh even Beyond

2228
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:09,480
sort of the formal sector uh review we

2229
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,040
want more eyes to look at this we want

2230
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,020
more people to build and implement this

2231
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,239
and figure out if there are any gotchas

2232
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:18,239
that we need to call out any you know uh

2233
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,800
sharp Corners that need to be rounded

2234
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,600
off

2235
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,300
um you know it is it is not an easy

2236
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,500
space to work in signing HTTP

2237
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,440
um but people have been doing it uh in

2238
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,080
the wild in sort of dangerous and

2239
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,120
incomplete ways for well over a decade

2240
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,460
at this point uh just about every AWS

2241
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,679
call uh goes through a whole chain of

2242
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:42,300
signed HTTP messages using their own

2243
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,280
proprietary mechanism

2244
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,080
that was one of the inputs to this work

2245
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,699
in the HTTP working group so we know

2246
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:50,340
that it works within certain domains and

2247
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,020
boundaries

2248
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:52,739
um

2249
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,620
and we want to make sure that this works

2250
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:58,860
in as wide a space as we can so this is

2251
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,199
our call out to The Wider security area

2252
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:04,739
to come come take a look at this uh play

2253
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:06,840
around with it see how it works and uh

2254
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,520
and help us make this the best it can be

2255
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,139
that's my last slide Mike is at the top

2256
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:15,679
of the queue

2257
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,440
my accountsworth so I recognize your

2258
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,420
this is hard we need help when do I get

2259
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,520
to use it uh so you can use it now

2260
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,020
actually uh there are a number of

2261
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,659
implementations in a bunch of different

2262
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:30,239
um uh platforms I've personally written

2263
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:33,960
one in Java and a probably not as good

2264
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,820
one in Python

2265
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:38,820
um like it's it's out there uh you know

2266
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,760
yarn Shuffle has one I think it's in go

2267
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:45,300
it's in go okay and browsers

2268
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,400
um so it is not built into browsers yet

2269
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,139
uh this is something that Annabelle and

2270
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:51,360
I have talked about a lot ideally what

2271
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,639
we would love to see is this part of uh

2272
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:56,699
as part of the fetch API so sort of post

2273
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:58,920
RFC that's something that we want to

2274
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,340
pursue so that a developer doesn't have

2275
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:04,920
to think about this that they call Fetch

2276
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,219
and hand a key and Magic happens that's

2277
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:10,679
what I want and we've done a little bit

2278
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:12,540
in trying to sort of write wrappers

2279
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,760
around fetch a couple of implementations

2280
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,100
that I've worked on we've kind of done

2281
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,980
done that kind of thing on the Java side

2282
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:24,120
I've uh my library I have adapted it so

2283
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,679
that you can wrap it around a spring

2284
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,440
rest template which is basically this

2285
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,320
the Java spring version of patch

2286
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,540
um and so you have you basically make a

2287
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:35,580
rest template handed a key and then it

2288
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,199
handles all of the signature stuff and

2289
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,699
putting it in the right spot and then

2290
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:42,120
there's a verifier on the HTTP servlet

2291
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,540
side again in Java that does the reverse

2292
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:48,060
of that to make sure that's validated

2293
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,800
um so yeah uh this is this is out there

2294
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,199
I will say one caution though when

2295
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:53,760
you're looking at this like I I

2296
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,620
mentioned before people have been doing

2297
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,960
this kind of in the wild and Loosely

2298
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,639
weird ways for a bunch for a bunch of

2299
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:00,420
years

2300
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:01,920
well there was an individual giraffe

2301
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,719
called cabbage signatures which a lot of

2302
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:05,159
people here are probably familiar with

2303
01:33:05,159 --> 01:33:07,260
at least in passing and especially with

2304
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,880
the rise of mastanon over the last

2305
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,739
couple weeks for reasons we won't get

2306
01:33:10,739 --> 01:33:14,580
into here Mastodon uses a very

2307
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:17,219
particular version a fork of a very

2308
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:19,380
particular version of the individual

2309
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:22,440
draft of cabbage signatures from many

2310
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,639
years ago

2311
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,139
so a lot of people have written

2312
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:28,020
implementations of that that is not the

2313
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,540
same as what's in the HTTP Biz draft and

2314
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:34,199
we would like to you know push uh that

2315
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:35,880
Community a lot of a lot of developers

2316
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,460
in that Community to sort of getting up

2317
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:41,159
to speed here so do takes a little bit

2318
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:42,540
of caution when you pull an HP

2319
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,280
signatures draft because it might mean

2320
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,560
several different things

2321
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,040
yeah so is this related to Sig V4

2322
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,620
so this is sort of the grandchild of Sig

2323
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:53,820
V4

2324
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,120
um so the Cabbage draft uh so

2325
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,760
um cabbage himself wrote Sig V4 at

2326
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,760
Amazon and then left Amazon and sort of

2327
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,040
dropped an ID out into the wild and that

2328
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,080
was the cabbage signatures draft that

2329
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,639
floated around without a working group

2330
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,980
for many years meanwhile uh a bunch

2331
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,659
there were a bunch of other attempts to

2332
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:15,719
also do HTTP signatures and we pulled

2333
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:18,139
all of that as input into the HTTP this

2334
01:34:18,139 --> 01:34:21,840
including the Sig V4 update

2335
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,219
um so I don't remember what that's

2336
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:25,860
called uh actually I'm I'm not sure what

2337
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,659
you mean by the Sig V4 update but

2338
01:34:27,659 --> 01:34:31,739
Annabelle works for AWS okay so she's so

2339
01:34:31,739 --> 01:34:33,960
hopefully she would have gone yeah

2340
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,060
um like I I have full confidence that

2341
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,080
she's

2342
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,699
she's got that

2343
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:39,540
um

2344
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,060
you know yeah she's got that covered it

2345
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:43,800
is not it is not wire compatible with

2346
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,080
Sig V4 there are some severe limitations

2347
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,760
with Sig V4

2348
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,100
um that this overcomes

2349
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,719
all right interesting but Amazon's

2350
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:55,020
playing so maybe okay I can either

2351
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:57,540
confirm nor deny Amazon's plans for this

2352
01:34:57,540 --> 01:35:00,679
draft well nobody can

2353
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:03,780
Joe yeah I just want to thank you guys

2354
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,179
for doing this because there are a lot

2355
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:09,239
of just wild west of HTTP signature

2356
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:10,980
schemes out there that you end up

2357
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:15,120
reviewing and they're not all great so

2358
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,120
it would you know and it is complicated

2359
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:21,300
and so thank you yeah absolutely agree

2360
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,179
um I will I will say one thing uh like I

2361
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:26,699
said I I was not I was not joking when I

2362
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:28,080
said that I've reinvented this three

2363
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,540
times is the problem that seems to be

2364
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:33,000
really easy to do it's it's one of those

2365
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,739
like how hard can it be until you sit

2366
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:36,719
down to actually do it and it's really

2367
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,580
hard

2368
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:41,040
uh Philip you're up next and Brennan I

2369
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,420
think you dropped off so if you didn't

2370
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:43,860
mean to do that please put yourself back

2371
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:45,000
in

2372
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,600
yeah sorry about the trailers thing I

2373
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,120
did my best

2374
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,500
basically what happened was a bunch of

2375
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,120
folk decided that they didn't want

2376
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,000
trailers and shipped code that meant

2377
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,880
that they would never work

2378
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,320
uh because you can ship a trailer it

2379
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,540
will the browser would think it was the

2380
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:06,500
start of the next message

2381
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:10,440
um yeah I I think that this is useful

2382
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:13,139
uh in the HTTP world

2383
01:36:13,139 --> 01:36:14,940
but

2384
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,199
um

2385
01:36:16,199 --> 01:36:18,659
really I think that we should recognize

2386
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:20,760
that web services

2387
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,420
uh are not optimal for HD HTTP is not

2388
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:27,179
optimal for web services and we should

2389
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:30,120
build something that is optimal for web

2390
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,179
services and doesn't start from all the

2391
01:36:33,179 --> 01:36:37,500
bizarre Legacy and so on that HTTP now

2392
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,540
has

2393
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:40,440
um

2394
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,620
I'm the way that I move signed messages

2395
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:46,980
over HTTP is I put a wrapper around it

2396
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:50,820
and I stick ship the payload ship that

2397
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:53,159
is the HTTP payload and then you get

2398
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:54,300
around the need for all this

2399
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:56,100
canonicalization whatever because your

2400
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,139
proxies aren't going to mess with it

2401
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:00,360
and that that's probably a better way of

2402
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:04,100
going about it than trying to get ATP

2403
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,060
infrastructure to do things that it

2404
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,820
should do but never will because

2405
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:11,060
well people

2406
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:14,280
so I will say that replacing HTTP is out

2407
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,560
of scope of this draft

2408
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,900
um I talked to the HTTP API Group I

2409
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,400
guess for that

2410
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,800
um and I do want to point out that the

2411
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,860
authors are very very familiar with

2412
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:29,340
encapsulation based schemes like uh like

2413
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:31,800
Philip was just talking about

2414
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,260
um we've deployed different versions of

2415
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:37,620
that and there are some really really

2416
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,900
big trade-offs you know into going in

2417
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,940
that direction as well yes it makes the

2418
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:43,320
crypto a little bit easier it actually

2419
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,920
makes the messaging portion a lot harder

2420
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,040
I do also want to point out that unlike

2421
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,739
previous versions uh this actually works

2422
01:37:52,739 --> 01:37:55,800
with H2 and H3

2423
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,800
um uh just kind of natively it uses it's

2424
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,620
it's based on the definitions in the

2425
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,719
draft are based on the semantic

2426
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:06,239
definitions of HTTP so as close to http

2427
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,460
gets as having to to having a formal

2428
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,920
model uh this is what everything is

2429
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,239
defined in as opposed to previous

2430
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,000
versions where take these bytes from

2431
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,520
this string as part of the http11

2432
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,540
message

2433
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,480
yeah we could just come back there for a

2434
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,860
second

2435
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:26,699
um if there's some applications where

2436
01:38:26,699 --> 01:38:29,219
you absolutely need this and when you've

2437
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:32,520
got one proxy that's signing a a message

2438
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,260
and then handing it over to another and

2439
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,540
handing it over to another absolutely

2440
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,460
you definitely need to have it in the

2441
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:41,040
HTTP there or bad things happen

2442
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,440
the place where I'm skeptical is the

2443
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,780
idea that you want this in the browser

2444
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:48,239
when the browser is producing something

2445
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,639
that is signed and the receiver is going

2446
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,860
to be depending upon it being signed I

2447
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:54,179
think that then the encapsulation

2448
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:57,960
approach is superior and more likely to

2449
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,920
appear in the browser

2450
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:05,880
Brendan uh so to be clear I haven't read

2451
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,139
the draft

2452
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:08,460
um and I'm just trying to understand

2453
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,340
exactly what the the target is here is

2454
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:12,420
this

2455
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:15,199
um essentially providing a message

2456
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:18,000
authenticity between a pre like a

2457
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,639
pre-established relationship for client

2458
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,320
to server server to client where does

2459
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,520
this fit

2460
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,880
um so it works for both server client

2461
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,480
and client to server okay and it is and

2462
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,120
key establishment and key negotiation is

2463
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,219
out of scope of this draft okay and it's

2464
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:38,040
like identity based not uh content

2465
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,320
authenticity so content office

2466
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,260
authenticity can be added if you use the

2467
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:47,159
HTTP digest draft which translates

2468
01:39:47,159 --> 01:39:49,739
um sort of the content into a header

2469
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,360
field which you can then cover with the

2470
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,440
signature okay thank you
