I'm an audio video technician you think

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,780
you'd be able to take

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,379
it okay

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,340
I think it feels like heat on full black

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,560
yeah there's a lot yeah are you guys

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,080

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,579
bit it'd be good all right just don't

room

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,399
really cool like you couldn't sit at the

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,700
front table

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,399

are are under the terms of the note well

34
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,040

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,899
intellectual property rights that you

um today we're going to talk about uh a

83
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,800
couple different items and we're gonna

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,660
spend the bulk of this since we had an

85
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,860
intern meeting pretty late pretty

86
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,120
recently we're going to spend the bulk

87
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,960
of this talking about what we're going

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,180
to do next but we'll get through this

89
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,120
very quickly in the first set of slides

90
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,699
summary today is just discussing why

91
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,560
we're here what we're doing we're going

92
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,080
to discuss fixing Errata the new table

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,900
of contents in the document some things

94
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,240
we did I did to version three four and

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
five and then other housekeeping and you

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,919
know what are we going to do for draft

97
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,380
one what's slated for release at the end

98
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,020
of the month so

99
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,100
the story thus far is uh myself and Brad

100
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,160
Peabody we're working on draft for New

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,080
uid formats this added specifically

102
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,500
version 678 and uuid Max and some best

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
practices that weren't in 4122. we went

104
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,560
to ietf 114 we did a dispatch session

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,320
and they officially said hey we should

106
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,820
create this working group which is where

107
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,979
we're at right now so the goal of draft

108
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,539
zero was to merge what we had in the new

109
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,740
Peabody document with RFC 4122 right in

110
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,120
addition to this we're going to go ahead

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,620
and fix the Errata we're going to squash

112
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,139
those as we go right as bugs

113
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,440
so the new draft zero zero that's been

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,919
published in October was effectively the

115
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
merge of these two documents so if

116
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
you're not up to speed on 678

117
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,520
um you know take take a little bit of

118
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
time to look at that if you're not up to

119
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,240
speed with some of the Errata take some

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,320
time to look at that because that's what

121
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,000
we're going to be talking about going

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,240
forward

123
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,240
um one thing that we found in creating

124
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,820
the Peabody document was that the 4122

125
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,039
layout and table of contents is just

126
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,960
tough very tough to work with to get the

127
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,360
concepts that we need across so in about

128
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,000
draft three of our document we decided

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,160
to overall the table of contents make it

130
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
a little bit more readable provide some

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,840
better groupings for these need to know

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
information things that are related and

133
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,979
things that are best practices so you

134
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,360
don't have to jump around 15 different

135
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,539
places in the document so in the order

136
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,639
we got when we came away with was

137
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,280
introductions and ietf language

138
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,479
you edit uid formats uid layouts the

139
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,740
best practices

140
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,199
the ietf considerations and things we

141
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,880
need like security considerations Ayana

142
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,100
considerations the references and then

143
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,560
appendixes for things like code and test

144
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,840
vectors and all the other stuff we want

145
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,080
to shove at the bottom as references

146
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,539
feedback from around the internet and on

147
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,759
the working group and some unicast chats

148
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,380
and stuff seem to be that this was a

149
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,960
good table of contents it pro it was

150
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,020
very readable it was better than 4122 so

151
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,699
I think that we're I think we should be

152
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,319
good to keep it

153
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,120
um but please let me know what you think

154
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,960
of that

155
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,940
one thing to note here is if you're

156
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,919
looking at 4122 and you're looking at

157
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,180
our document you're going to see a

158
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,699
distinct missing sections which are

159
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,340
those algorithms to create maybe a

160
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,400
time-based uuid or a random-based uuid

161
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,919
again I removed these around draft 3 of

162
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,199
our document because they just didn't

163
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
work well and it caused all kinds of

164
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,300
weird issues extrapolating that so that

165
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,759
stuff has been just reworked into these

166
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,340
specific layout section right so how to

167
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,880
create a uuid version 3 is all contained

168
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,620
within uuid version three and then any

169
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,599
best practices for maybe three and five

170
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,199
are down in a specific name based uuid

171
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,240
section so kind of just a slightly

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,740
different layout but that content still

173
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,840
exists

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,780
uh quite a quick question uh speaking a

175
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,960
little bit out of turn is the um uh are

176
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,880
those algorithms are they going in as

177
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,860
informative appendices or anything like

178
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,120
that or are they going to be out

179
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,860
entirely

180
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,919
we I've reused all of the text from

181
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,979
those they're just very dated in the way

182
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,900
that they're written um I guess the best

183
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,180
way to put it I can easily just copy and

184
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,620
put and paste and put them in as

185
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,360
appendixes we don't want to lose the

186
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,700
text but I don't think anything that was

187
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,919
there is gone

188
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,599
um and it was it was just very tough

189
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,539
writing like version seven to a one of

190
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,099
those for version seven and stuff we

191
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,479
just had a lot of issues with it it

192
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,279
seemed to just take a lot of text it

193
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,660
wasn't needed you could be better

194
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,980
conveyed in a different format

195
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:53,820
I I wasn't concerned about the the

196
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,860
specific text I just wanted to make sure

197
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,899
that the uh you know the nature of the

198
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,220
algorithms that we weren't losing the

199
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,640
algorithms entirely they if we so yeah

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,860
so the algorithms aren't necessarily an

201
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,360
algorithm like you expect like a code

202
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,120
algorithm or math or any of those types

203
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,820
there are they're just text like here's

204
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,440
a set of steps and they're not even

205
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,540
steps they're just unnumbered bulleted

206
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,180
list of do these things from a very

207
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,880
um basic programmatic View kind of just

208
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,260
a suit it's pseudocode more than

209
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,839
anything we haven't Bill document either

210
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,779
okay yeah that's true thank you

211
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,240
awesome

212
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,940
um next up is the Errata so I actually

213
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,740
wasn't planning to get this done in

214
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,680
draft zero zero but when I was creating

215
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,500
the Errata entries for the GitHub and

216
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,480
actually just reading these I started

217
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,860
kind of just seeing the big picture that

218
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,540
these sort of fell into two categories

219
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,519
and that's grammatical Errata which were

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,560
super easy to fix I mean we just follow

221
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,839
what they say to do in in there and I

222
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,700
agreed with pretty much all of them as

223
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,740
well as lots of Errata just around

224
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,959
clarifications around which bit where

225
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,360
which you know which level of Indian is

226
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,519
should we use

227
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,040
they're harder to fix and I have gone

228
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,540
through the document and made an attempt

229
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,420
to make it conform to each of these uh

230
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,779
six Indian sort of bit layout erratas

231
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,420
and really to boil it down it comes down

232
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,760
to very consistent language I'm using

233
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
big Indian because that's that's what

234
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,779
every one of these uses from what I can

235
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,779
see in reviewing the other specs

236
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,339
defining where most significant bits are

237
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,800
using some helper verbiage like leftmost

238
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,899
if we're talking about that defining

239
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,240
where our bit and byte order and

240
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,120
numbering start so I put some text in

241
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,940
um actually borrowed from x667 which is

242
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,620
documents kind of mirrored with we'll

243
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,480
talk about in a minute it talks about

244
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
how we start our numbering where our

245
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,740
bits and bytes are where things like the

246
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,779
variant should be where these bytes

247
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,600
exist kind of just being very specific

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,180
overly specific in these and to hit on

249
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,700
these points so people know exactly how

250
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
and where we're talking about in these

251
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,160
in these 128 bits and I think I did a

252
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,579
pretty good job I do want to solicit

253
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,459
some feedback on these types topics

254
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,899
right here since they were such a major

255
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,420
deal just look at these

256
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,980
keep them in the back your head and then

257
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,420
when you look through the document see

258
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,360
if something I I wrote is incorrectly

259
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,760
referencing or might have some gray area

260
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,860
and then we can fix it right because

261
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,720
this is out of all the Errata this is

262
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,100
the biggest thing that we want to fix

263
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,100
but I think at the moment the Iran is

264
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,420
good unless somebody tells me otherwise

265
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,560
is my final point

266
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,640
moving to uh the document so in the

267
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,980
document the original document 4122

268
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,019
version one was kind of the starting

269
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,360
point for all of the other uuids it used

270
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,980
the bit layout and the in sort of the

271
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,920
block layout of all the bits it used the

272
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,620
names of all the different fields

273
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,060
um and everything referenced back to

274
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,100
that so if you were doing a version for

275
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,899
uuid or you were following the version

276
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,779
four algorithm to create a random uuid

277
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,860
everything used uh terms like it was a

278
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,320
uuid version one because it just that

279
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,700
was the starting point point of

280
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,160
reference and it can become very

281
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,480
confusing especially in version three

282
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,160
and version five when you're talking

283
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,000
about

284
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,560
um you know modifying a field called

285
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,680
time in milliseconds or or time high and

286
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,959
low and you're changing it to be some

287
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,740
other some other meaning so one thing we

288
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,959
did with version six seven and eight is

289
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,060
we gave them all their own block layouts

290
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,820
they got their own field definitions and

291
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,440
and just in that section you can go

292
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
straight to that section and see it

293
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,019
without needing to go read and

294
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,139
understand uuid version one so I did

295
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,000
that with three four and five there's a

296
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
lot of net new text

297
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,079
and a lot of text pulled from those

298
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,579
algorithms to create

299
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,820
X right so it decouples these provides

300
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,860
better clarification and allows me to

301
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,420
again group together things that are

302
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,459
super important to these as well as

303
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,339
provide better text vectors and

304
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,380
extra clarification that we didn't have

305
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,660
because it was a here's version one and

306
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,459
it's the bulk of the document and then

307
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,139
here's how you do these other three and

308
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,120
they reference version one so you got to

309
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,380
kind of you got the chicken for the egg

310
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,519
scenario maybe you don't care about

311
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,959
version one you just want to do a

312
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,360
version three well now the section just

313
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,860
has that and it has everything you need

314
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,959
to know about that

315
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,100
so update here you know I want to just

316
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,200
get some reviews on version three four

317
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,959
and five text they should mean exactly

318
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,040
the same as they mentioned in the

319
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,760
previous document if I maybe

320
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,720
move something or gloss something

321
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,300
slightly incorrectly I apologize I can

322
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,940
fix it but this is all net new for three

323
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,860
four and five a lot in that new

324
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,940
next up is General housekeeping I went

325
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,380
through the document

326
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,420
um replaced any HTTP link with https

327
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,060
links to the relevant site all RFC

328
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,740
references have been updated to their

329
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,320
latest versions as well as external

330
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,060
references if something's been bumped I

331
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,160
made sure I checked it and bumped it as

332
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,019
well as security considerations I added

333
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,540
some info for sha-1 and md5 since we

334
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,279
have a couple rfcs discussing those

335
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,620
topics specifically I added those to the

336
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,480
relevant security consideration links

337
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,040
and reference them appropriately

338
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,500
go ahead Mark uh there's one

339
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,720
um RSC reference you haven't updated

340
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,300
which is 4234 5234 is current for ABN f

341
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,260
it is current for a b and F okay A B and

342
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,500
F did I bump a b and F or did I just not

343
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,199
update the reference

344
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,720
you're still referring to 4234 and I

345
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
have some other corrections to make

346
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,480
around a b enough but since you listed

347
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,920
RFC references I thought I'd mentioned

348
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,040
yeah okay understood yeah yeah and that

349
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,480
that is one thing I didn't even I didn't

350
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
think about here the a b and F uh

351
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,980
the way the ABN F was maybe

352
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,899
I looked at that and it didn't update it

353
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,820
but I did touch the ABN F stuff just a

354
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,260
slight bit I forgot to put this in the

355
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,399
notes

356
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,959
um so maybe we can talk about that real

357
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,579
fast if you would like since we're on

358
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,079
the topic ABN f

359
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,760
that's where I go into the

360
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
draft one

361
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,240
um your change log says you went from

362
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,300
2234 to 4234.

363
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,620
but the correct current reference is

364
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,980
5234 okay so I just did okay understood

365
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,440
yep my mistake that's right what was

366
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
what was the other thing you wanted to

367
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,660
talk about

368
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,380
so with a b and F I did shorten the abnf

369
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,860
uh uh nomenclature just slightly because

370
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,839
there was it just it was it was much

371
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,220
larger than it needed to be for the

372
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,560
logic of ABN F but it still conveys the

373
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,199
same meaning I just made it more concise

374
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,820
that's okay

375
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,079
um one of the things I was just looking

376
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,760
at some of the ABN F and for example you

377
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,220
have a token called hex octet I think

378
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,959
and I couldn't figure out where that's

379
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,279
combined

380
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,220
yeah I I believe that was also from

381
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,500
theirs but I I'll take a look at it

382
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,120
if you will if the thing is if you're

383
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,100
obsoleting 4122 you have to carry the

384
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,300
definitions forward because that

385
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,440
document's dead then yeah I guess my the

386
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,459
um

387
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,100
the hex the hex octet should be two hex

388
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,540
digits put together which should be

389
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,579
there and if I if I accidentally cut it

390
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,279
off but yeah what you have is what you

391
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,560
have is two hex octet like that's the

392
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,720
literal string it should be I think it

393
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,940
should be two star but also hex octet

394
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,380
itself is not defined anywhere

395
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,040
I can email you all that stuff as I find

396
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,139
it yeah yeah I understand you I

397
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,880
understand your point yep

398
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,759
the the two hex octet and the four hex

399
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,380
octet those are from the original

400
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,720
document specifically the reason that I

401
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,300
redid the ABN F was because it all

402
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,180
referenced back to uuid version one so

403
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,759
again decoupling version one from other

404
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,699
stuff so ABN F was Rewritten but I may

405
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,680
have just missed hexapta thank you for

406
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,800
that

407
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,859
all right next up is

408
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,240
um some action items we're going to talk

409
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,579
about things that I plan to do for draft

410
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,980
one Cadence for releasing would be

411
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,799
monthly so I plan to work on these and

412
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,059
push this out by the end of the month

413
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,480
we'll iterate on that draft two by the

414
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,220
end of December so on and so forth to

415
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,939
IET f115 so or 116. so we got some time

416
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,679
till March

417
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,980
this one is ietf names or namespaces

418
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,080
specifically for version three when I

419
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
did an audit and review of a bunch of

420
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,460
these big libraries that Implement

421
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,760
version three and five I found that the

422
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,740
majority of these libraries only Define

423
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,000
the namespaces that we defined in 4122

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
um furthermore there's no text

425
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,600
describing how we got to these values in

426
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,100
the first place so

427
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
I don't know where they came from

428
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,240
they're just slapped into an appendix

429
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,460
I have some lot I see some logic in them

430
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,260
but if anybody has any threads or

431
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,760
mailers they can send me something from

432
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,160
the old days that'd be awesome but my

433
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,100
point here is should we potentially toss

434
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,679
in a new name space that follows what I

435
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,720
see is the logic for something like iot

436
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
devices and databases which are nowadays

437
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,720
very big use cases so that other

438
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,840
libraries will Implement them because it

439
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,460
seems to be again that if we don't

440
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,039
Define it they won't implement it and

441
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,780
there could be others these are just the

442
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,520
two off the top of my head working with

443
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,980
uuids in this space for the past three

444
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,160
years

445
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,380
so I can I can work on that I don't know

446
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,820
if there's any comments any open items

447
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,679
anybody want to discuss we can move to

448
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,559
the next slide if so yeah uh Brendan has

449
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,260
a has a comment so uh we'll recognize

450
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,460
him

451
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,140
um I've encountered a number of missing

452
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,360
namespaces as I've been working in suit

453
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,419
as well and the solution at the time was

454
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,260
to put down the uh mechanism to generate

455
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,919
the namespaces I used in the suit uh

456
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
manifest draft I'd be happy to forward

457
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,000
that on to you

458
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,559
um one of the things that I thought was

459
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,780
particularly relevant is that there was

460
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,299
no private Enterprise number

461
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,720
um prefix there was an oid prefix but

462
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,100
there was no definition about how you

463
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,840
dealt with oids and what kind of

464
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,640
encoding you used for the oid when

465
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,940
generating a uuid so I wrote all of that

466
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,100
down and how I was going to do it

467
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,480
um I thought maybe that would be

468
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,919
something to document as well and I'd be

469
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,320
happy to send that on to you yes please

470
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,080
uh I'll look forward to that um I got a

471
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,640
topic on oids that's coming up in

472
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,559
another slide thank you we'll touch on

473
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,840
that but um yeah

474
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,880
I think you're you're right we just need

475
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,559
to define a couple more namespaces and

476
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,419
then just a better way to how we handle

477
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:52,080
this

478
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,740
okay thank you yep

479
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,500
and just commenting on Murray out loud I

480
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,080
do see the issue with the hex octet I

481
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,400
just

482
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
um

483
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,600
I'll I'll put it on the mailer thank you

484
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,380
I'm going to move to this one quick

485
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,299
slide I don't know if the gentleman who

486
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,740
brought this up in the interim meeting

487
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,860
is on this this meeting but there was a

488
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,200
discussion around uh adding some best

489
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,299
practices with running out of random

490
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,919
that is do you Generate random for every

491
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,799
uuid and

492
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,799
you slap it in there or do you generate

493
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,140
one set of random and some counters and

494
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,760
and is there some security

495
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,679
considerations around using certain

496
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,080
types of pseudo-random generators versus

497
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,320
other types which can cause issues with

498
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,760
running out of random exhausting your

499
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,179
random entropy source and honestly it's

500
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,620
a little bit out of my league on that

501
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,480
topic to write about it gentleman said

502
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,100
he was going to send me some notes I

503
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,600
never saw the notes I checked all the

504
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,059
issue trackers I don't know what the

505
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,980
context was there so if anybody has that

506
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,260
that uh that person or that name I'd

507
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,480
love to sync up with them as well

508
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,940
so Brendan Warren here again that person

509
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,780
was me uh the issue specifically is that

510
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,059
on certain Hardware that uses true

511
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,100
random number generators

512
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,419
you can exhaust the trng that can be

513
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,760
used to construct side channels inside

514
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,100
your processor this is probably not

515
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,200
something you want

516
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,500
okay is that is that a

517
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,360
in terms of how we change this and

518
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,159
modify the text I can propose some some

519
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,720
text and have you review it does that

520
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,840
seem okay Brendan yeah absolutely I I

521
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,880
think fundamentally it's just a question

522
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,179
of maybe don't generate a new random

523
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,600
number for every single uuid maybe for

524
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,460
every single time increment would be

525
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,419
enough

526
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,260
it yeah or as Brad and I have said we

527
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,480
lay out the pros and the cons and make

528
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,280
sure we explicitly Define the cons and

529
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,020
if somebody wants to go against that and

530
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,460
they will willingly know what they're

531
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,600
doing

532
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,460
so be it but yeah I think we just Define

533
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,140
it it's like a security consideration

534
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,720
section absolutely yep that's where I

535
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
have it tagged for right now thank you

536
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,440
okay that one's good got that thank you

537
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,559
um namespace registration template I

538
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
need to update the namespace

539
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,980
registration template and make sure that

540
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,419
it follows our new RFC 8141 that

541
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,039
shouldn't take too long

542
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,340
um to do it's just do we actually need

543
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,080
to put a namespace registration template

544
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,059
in since it's already allocated I guess

545
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,860
that's a question for the chairs

546
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,200
um how to handle this do I just slap the

547
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,940
new updated template in do we need to

548
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,299
submit anything after updating it uh I

549
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,760
think if if it's already been allocated

550
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,780
in 4122 then we actually don't there's

551
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,539
no Ayana consideration for that we just

552
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,039
go ahead we may we may say I am

553
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,500
Ayanna allocated this and that's it if

554
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,299
you if we need to reference it we can

555
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,100
say it was already allocated by this

556
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,820
other RFC

557
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,679
okay understand if you look at if if you

558
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,440
look at what happens the document like

559
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,539
4122's probably said dear Ayanna please

560
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,700
allocate please do this registration for

561
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,860
us and then as I got processed it said I

562
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,080
am it took past tense it says

563
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,840
Ayana allocated blah blah blah so the

564
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,419
the text in 4122 actually you could just

565
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,520
use that text if you wanted if we really

566
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,620
we needed to be clear that we had

567
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,600
allocated this then you can just use

568
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,940
that text Iana allocated blah blah blah

569
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,480
as per RFC 4122 and you're done there's

570
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
no action in the end okay I'll check it

571
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,720
and double check I've put it in a

572
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,460
appendix because at the original

573
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,520
document had it in smack dab is like one

574
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,840
of the first things you read which is

575
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,280
kind of out of place and broke and

576
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,900
really messed with the logical reading

577
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,120
of the document so I applied that to an

578
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,500
appendix

579
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,240
yeah I probably should go be so that

580
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,400
would wind up after the author's names

581
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,260
and so probably it should go and the and

582
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,580
the references it probably should go

583
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,140
before those so it should be shouldn't

584
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,740
be an appendix

585
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,419
should I

586
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,980
should I move it to the Ayana

587
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,780
consideration section which at the

588
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,299
moment says no considerations yes I I

589
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,500
would do that

590
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,760
okay

591
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,419
that works

592
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,600
got it

593
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,539
uh next up is I've got a couple issue

594
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,460
tracker items for version seven and

595
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,539
eight

596
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,480
um number one is at some point we had

597
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,000
version 8 restricted to just new

598
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,940
versions of time-based euids and then it

599
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,580
was relaxed to any you know vendor

600
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,799
specific implementation uuids can't

601
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,039
can't do or experimental and I forgot to

602
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,039
remove some verbiage so we we caught

603
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,440
brewfa caught some some info there and

604
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,000
we're going to remove that

605
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
and then this one is further clarifying

606
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,900
field descriptions it doesn't change

607
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,299
anything specifically but just adds a

608
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,559
little bit further clarification about

609
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,440
the usage of milliseconds timestamp and

610
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,240
a forward cup a couple forward

611
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
references so I think they should be

612
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,620
good to merge I just wanted to ask the

613
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,059
group and make sure

614
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,220
if we're okay with that

615
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,080
they're they're really just very simple

616
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,799
small non-impacting changes

617
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,720
have you asked the question on the list

618
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,400
that's probably the best way to make

619
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,860
sure that it's covered and documented

620
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,720
yep I haven't I haven't moved it yet

621
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,679
again

622
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,640
great thank you

623
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,000
okay

624
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,740
um this one's a little bit longer and I

625
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,659
I will take this to the list this is

626
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,340
from Ben Ben put out uh discussing the

627
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,179
fact that we have the maxi uid

628
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,480
the Maxi uid does encroach upon the

629
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,299
reserved variant space which is at the

630
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,480
moment a hex value of an e or an f and

631
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,640
the variant ID would all have all hex

632
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,120
values of f because it's all ones and we

633
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,559
need to effectively discuss

634
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,140
where that lies and how to effectively

635
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,539
put that in there this doesn't affect

636
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,820
the nil uuid because that kind of goes

637
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,460
into some older terminology called

638
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,220
families which is what was used before

639
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,279
there were variants and

640
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,460
effectively Ben is looking to update the

641
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,080
variant table with a section that adds a

642
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,039
column for bytes so that within the hex

643
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,880
of f for the future variant we can

644
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,179
discuss what that byte can or cannot be

645
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:46,140
it's very very clarified like to the to

646
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,059
very to a very nitty-gritty kind of

647
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,039
level that I'm not sure if we really

648
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,740
need to do it makes sense when you when

649
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,880
you discuss it there's a lot of

650
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,140
discussion here I can take it to the

651
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,820
mailer this is one thing that I'm going

652
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,159
to look at for draft one

653
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,720
um and it's just do we add another

654
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,179
column to the table taking this to a

655
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,340
bite level for these variants and what

656
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,178
is or is not available

657
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,480
next up is

658
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,460
um this one is something I came across

659
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,860
while I was just looking through all the

660
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,299
references and updating the references

661
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,059
and really just trying to make sure 4122

662
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,880
stood on its own or the new document

663
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,100
stood on its own and I noticed that

664
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,779
apparently at one point in time RFC 4122

665
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:39,360
itu x667 and the iso 9838 documents were

666
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,679
exactly the same

667
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,559
they were all the same document and one

668
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,059
was telecommunications standard an

669
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,679
international standard and then an RFC

670
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,640
proposed standard in 667 they updated it

671
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,039
in 2008 and then they updated again in

672
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,980
2012. I assume ISO was in lockstep

673
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,659
because they updated their document in

674
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,880
2008 and then again in 2014 but 2014 and

675
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,679
2012 documents look to be exactly the

676
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:05,940
same

677
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,700
our document was never updated and has

678
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,980
no none of these changes specifically

679
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,240
one of these things in there is

680
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,840
discussing oids and how to use a uuid as

681
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,640
an oid so to the other gentleman's

682
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,799
comments about oids they have that text

683
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,799
in their document which we could take

684
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,480
now we've got a different table of

685
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
contents we've potentially added 678 Max

686
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,400
and we've added a significant deviation

687
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:37,200
my concern is first where do we fit into

688
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,820
this picture and do we have the

689
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,340
authority to add the new uuids and the

690
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,880
things that we are doing and if we do

691
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,880
how do we get involvement with itu and

692
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,340
ISO so that they can be in lockstep with

693
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,380
us

694
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,740
and final question

695
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,159
should I pull in text like the oid

696
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,659
information and whatever else I can diff

697
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,820
out from their change log into our

698
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,178
document

699
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,020
and that's the open floor for for

700
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,320
questions and chairs microphone yeah I

701
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,880
think we have Liaisons to those

702
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,740
organizations so

703
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,880
um

704
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,980
either the chairs or I can help you

705
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,779
activate them to ask those questions of

706
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,120
those organizations

707
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,279
um I'm curious another way to turn that

708
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,899
question around is what do these

709
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,179
organizations think of 4122 in terms of

710
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,679
its Authority

711
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,159
exactly and and they were updating

712
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,200
without us so maybe they

713
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,760
Authority how did they do that without

714
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,340
violating your copyright

715
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,500
no I'm serious I'm serious I understand

716
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,299
I even thought of that because because

717
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,580
well no but if you go I went and looked

718
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,440
up the documents the iso document the

719
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,720
198 Swiss Francs for

720
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,460
was that was gonna be my next question

721
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,440
yeah are these behind pay walls so so

722
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,080
that's the weird part so the iso IEC

723
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,840
document is behind a payroll the itu

724
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,880
document is one of the rare ones that's

725
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,899
not

726
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,299
right but they probably stand but

727
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,460
they've converted it to word and stuck

728
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,419
their copyright on it

729
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,059
they have the authority to update it

730
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,240
because they're because they yeah so I

731
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,659
mean for that I'm not sure that we can

732
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,760
uh copy and paste their text

733
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,820
uh but you know we certainly can be make

734
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,940
sure we're not incompatible right right

735
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,799
right

736
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,240
let's let's use let's get the Liaisons

737
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,580
involved yeah exactly okay

738
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,960
um that was so my next question was

739
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,580
going to be our entities behind paywalls

740
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,020
because when I come to the isg for

741
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,279
review and we can't review your

742
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,020
reference documents how are we supposed

743
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,240
to say that this is good or not

744
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,500
um so that's something to start thinking

745
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,820
about earlier right is usually the

746
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,380
solution is we go to the organization

747
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,059
and say look we need this we need

748
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,860
temporary access to this so that

749
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,240
reviewers can do their thing you don't

750
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,000
have to give us permanent free anything

751
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,279
but uh we we the isg have sometimes

752
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,380
gotten sticky about that one

753
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,940
when those come up

754
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,539
absolutely thank you ISO is is behind a

755
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:13,980
paywall yeah that's I'll

756
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,380
I'll look for those Liaisons from the

757
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,740
chairs and see what we can discuss

758
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,899
um the only other the only thing that I

759
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,580
would say we would probably have to

760
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,620
Define and it's a it's a quick one-liner

761
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,640
is the oids and I can easily add that to

762
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,020
draft one and it references back to x667

763
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,840
so it's so we can uh you know put our

764
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,159
own spin on the language and the

765
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,200
verbiage and write it up but they do

766
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,299
have a really nice defined way to use

767
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,120
oids as an integer or as a hex layout

768
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,159
hex and dash

769
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,080
yes Brendan go ahead

770
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,799
so the oid consideration that I was

771
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,020
mentioning earlier was the reverse it

772
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,399
was how do you convert an oid into a

773
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:03,960
uuid and there are there is a namespace

774
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,200
defined for that in 4122 but it does not

775
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,240
explain which encoding of oid you should

776
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,179
use and I have seen people using texting

777
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,000
Coatings of you of oids I have seen

778
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,059
people using binary encodings of oids

779
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,460
and I guarantee you because I did it

780
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,559
you're going to find someone using a

781
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,620
c-bore encoding of an oid

782
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,720
yep understood

783
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,059
understood yeah I see what you mean with

784
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,820
the namespace though ID name space and

785
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,100
and vice versa okay I got it on my notes

786
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,219
Here

787
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,840
um last one was just thinking about long

788
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,059
term with this let's say we have all

789
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,340
this we're ready to go we got all of our

790
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,559
drafts finished

791
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,260
this sat for as a proposed standard for

792
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,659
a pretty long time itu has theirs of

793
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,340
telecommunity to standard got the iso

794
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,299
International standard should this

795
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:05,460
be potentially something that is is an

796
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,200
internet standard so it has the same

797
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,360
Authority as the rest and in that

798
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,100
respect how do you propose once we get

799
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,779
to that point how does it get elevated

800
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,120
because it sets in 2005 as a post

801
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,980
standard and I see this everywhere it's

802
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,140
ubiquitous across anything you look at

803
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,299
in Tech

804
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,299
go ahead Murray um

805
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,399
on first glance and there may be some

806
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,080
subtleties here that I haven't grasp yet

807
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,899
uh you're adding three new UI uuid types

808
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,100
that have never been standardized before

809
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,779
so you can't go to internet standard

810
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,179
right now you could on everything up to

811
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:37,799
six but not not six seven and eight

812
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,360
themselves because they're new or they

813
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
appear to be new from our perspective so

814
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,880
the process then would be you re you rev

815
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,440
this like you're doing at proposed

816
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,940
standard

817
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,220
um and then for whatever period of time

818
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,380
we're supposed to wait you wait let it

819
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,640
deploy and be out in the world and then

820
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,899
you come back around and say all right

821
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:55,980
we need to elevate this the internet

822
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,960
standard without changing or like with

823
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,340
whatever changes are allowed for that

824
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,200
piece of the process but I think you

825
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,399
could get resistance right now to be

826
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,600
wait a minute you can't introduce three

827
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,059
types and say it's a standard yep that

828
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,559
completely makes it completely makes

829
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,799
sense

830
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,699
I was going to say exactly the same

831
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,020
thing and I think that number is two

832
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,899
years and I think it can be done as a we

833
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,159
don't have to revenue document

834
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,080
necessarily

835
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,540
um if there's a rata then we would but

836
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,619
otherwise it's a isg magic wand yep uh

837
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,719
and it becomes a I think it's up a step

838
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,239
I think it's Errata or anything like if

839
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,219
you have one through eight and like you

840
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,960
discovered nobody uses two so let's just

841
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,119
take two out or Mark two as deprecated

842
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,679
one through one through eight except for

843
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
two I'm making this up as I go but yeah

844
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,359
then we can say this is all standard

845
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,219
except two is deprecated and then that

846
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,020
would work too and I think we are

847
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,199
removing some in this document right

848
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,280
uh there's nothing nothing removed to

849
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,800
two is just not owned by us it's it's

850
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,740
got its own specification uh through a

851
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,420
whole completely different

852
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,980
um organizational body

853
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,980
and I just added a second reference to

854
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,660
that so that people can go do that if

855
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,400
they want that's it's almost never

856
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,680
implemented anywhere and on the comments

857
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,119
of who has Authority

858
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,540
every library that I've looked at in

859
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,140
source code reviews has used 4122 in

860
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,440
Snippets in in references to 4122 is

861
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,320
there for their implementation uh that's

862
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,060
that's because one of them costs money

863
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,040
and the other one probably cost money

864
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,200
until recently and why would you bother

865
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,200
right right it completely understand yep

866
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,760
just one of the comments on that that

867
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,180
was all I had and I guess I'll turn it

868
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,319
back over to you folks thank you

869
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,599
uh so one more there's you don't have an

870
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,619
issue about this yet and I haven't

871
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,320
raised it before so surprise

872
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,160
um

873
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,160
I looked at 4122 and it has no use of

874
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,619
BCP 14 or like must should none of that

875
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,119
stuff is there you've added it in this

876
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,200
document

877
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,859
but generally yeah the the the uh

878
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:09,599
template that gets created by uh one of

879
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,460
the other folks on on here Michael or so

880
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,460
that adds that and yes our draft

881
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,339
originally had that as well so yes we

882
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,460
had BCP 14 in there okay so there's 44

883
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,520
shoulds in this document and every time

884
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,320
I see one of those I think all right so

885
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,240
you're giving an implementer a choice to

886
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,460
do one or the other like do the thing or

887
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,140
not do the thing but there's no

888
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,940
particular guidance about why you might

889
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,740
not do the thing that it says you should

890
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,160
do and we generally like these days like

891
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,900
to see some sort of hint about why might

892
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,940
I decide not to do what this is why am I

893
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,400
what am I might I legitimately to do not

894
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,020
sorry let me start again

895
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,720
why might I legitimately decide not to

896
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,579
do what the should says

897
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,020
and if you can't come up with an answer

898
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,640
to that then maybe it's either a May or

899
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,320
a must

900
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,460
yes and I I think that comes from just

901
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,859
reluctance on the part of polite people

902
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,800
to tell people must yes right and and

903
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,859
and so you exactly so and I think

904
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,020
they're almost all musts but we'll have

905
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,339
to we have to go through and see if

906
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:12,420
there's exceptions that's what I was

907
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,619
going to suggest to just go through and

908
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:14,880
make like how do you really feel

909
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,680
comfortable giving someone apps if

910
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,119
they're giving them Absolute breadth to

911
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,040
decide then it's a May if you're giving

912
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,300
them no way out then it's a must

913
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,460
otherwise you should have a clear idea

914
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,380
in your head why I might decide not to

915
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,780
do whatever the thing says

916
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,020
yeah in my my comment on that

917
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,500
specifically is the entire best

918
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,760
practices section does detail the yeses

919
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,619
and the no's the why would you do this

920
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,300
and why wouldn't you do this and then

921
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,660
provides the should guidance we had a

922
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,180
fair amount of musts in like draft zero

923
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,540
three I think and every issue tracker it

924
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,640
seemed like everybody was opening was

925
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,500
this must should be assured because they

926
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,940
have some situation where they want to

927
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,619
do something slightly different so we

928
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,599
documented that in the best practice and

929
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,220
took it from a must down to a should so

930
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,680
we actually did have way more musts back

931
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,079
in the day that got moved down to

932
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,180
shoulds because people wanted us to

933
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,119
document one-offs and caveats and things

934
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,520
that we put in best practices so

935
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,560
that's that's my comment on the musk for

936
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,760
should

937
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,460
so we need to we need to just someone

938
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,800
else needs to do a a walk through yeah

939
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,780
you Kaiser because you're probably too

940
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,119
close to the text I'm too close yes yes

941
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,339
just to figure out whether whether

942
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,680
whether there's an exception listed

943
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,300
clearly

944
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,820
absolutely yeah and I I completely

945
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,920
understand and I do want that so if

946
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,440
there isn't I all for it they're not all

947
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,540
in best practices for example for

948
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,880
version eight UI deviates uniqueness

949
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,680
will be implemented station specific and

950
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,200
should not be assumed when when am I

951
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,420
okay to assume it

952
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,520
yeah if you're gonna say should not you

953
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,060
know okay thank you

954
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:59,400
yep that's an easy must not yep got it

955
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,740
so that was your last flight was it

956
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,980
yes yes sir

957
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,859
um so I have uh

958
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,980
um one item to bring up his future

959
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,020
virtual interims and I want to leave

960
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,599
that too late to watch the end

961
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,520
um but first I think we should just open

962
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,359
the mic line to any other issues or

963
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,920
agenda bashes at this point

964
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,099
anybody else

965
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,780
so I'm going to kick you off the slides

966
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,760
here

967
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,859
let me do that

968
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,000
revoke slides

969
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,500
share that screen

970
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
so

971
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,940
so uh we had put up uh on the mailing

972
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,099
lists

973
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:05,280
back and in October

974
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,920
um a second not a doodle poll

975
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,020
because they really annoyed me as a

976
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,880
paying customer

977
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,780
um

978
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,140
I paid for like eight years and anyway

979
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,480
um so try this thing rally uh this was

980
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,099
the link here I just posted that link

981
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,079
into the chat as well a couple minutes

982
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,820
ago

983
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,339
um and we have

984
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,160
uh basically five of us having answered

985
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,500
this so it would be great if if you care

986
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,119
about when we schedule things if you

987
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,160
want to put your name there

988
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,920
um and so you know like I can see that

989
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,040
uh November 23rd which maybe a bit soon

990
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,619
would be a really good time but um

991
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,780
there's other days that that would work

992
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,220
or not work and so we're just going to

993
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,680
pick some of those days as uh I think we

994
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,300
wanted to have a virtual interim in

995
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,760
early December

996
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,040
and middle January and middle February

997
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,160
with the idea that we counseled them if

998
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,160
we didn't if we're all done and that we

999
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,339
would probably ideally not have a have

1000
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,020
an in-person meeting in March because

1001
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,260
we'd be in working group last call or

1002
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,000
past that point

1003
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,619
does anyone anyone have a problem with

1004
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,760
that schedule

1005
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,920
um so please get your name in there if

1006
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,140
you want to attend

1007
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,940
um based on

1008
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,280
I think most of us being mostly in North

1009
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,020
America

1010
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,820
Brendan's exception that would probably

1011
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,900
wind up you know uh with late morning

1012
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,599
kind of times uh for that

1013
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,540
traditional 10 o'clock

1014
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,480
uh Eastern you know or something like

1015
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,700
that in Austin

1016
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,880
yeah exactly so I expect it to be in

1017
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,920
your time zone but I won't be

1018
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,480
um so uh put your name there

1019
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,060
uh and uh

1020
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,339
um

1021
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:01,800
that's about it for me

1022
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,180
um

1023
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,980
we got to cover the other question I had

1024
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,380
which was the standards internet uh

1025
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,300
draft and how internet standard and how

1026
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,920
we're going to get there so we covered

1027
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,079
that already I was going to talk a

1028
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,220
little bit about

1029
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,400
um uh working group adoption and and

1030
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,820
that sort of thing so I from a from a

1031
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,280
process standpoint I think we we kind of

1032
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,800
jumped to step on the on the process uh

1033
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,320
in um in moving it from

1034
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,500
from the uh

1035
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,260
initial author drafts to a working group

1036
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,720
graph because uh you know there that's

1037
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,000
normally accompanied by kind of a a

1038
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,740
working group consensus and that sort of

1039
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,720
thing so in any case that has happened

1040
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,400
and and you know we don't need to

1041
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,160
revisit that I don't think but uh one

1042
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,980
thing I I'd like you to like like to

1043
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,320
have everybody keep in mind is that I

1044
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,880
mean to the extent that everybody's kind

1045
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,800
of agreed on everything then sure just

1046
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,040
edit it into the document no problem but

1047
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,099
as a working group draft

1048
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:05,640
um uh the the original authors are now

1049
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,599
editors and so really it it the the idea

1050
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,920
is that if there's something that's

1051
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,500
controversial that that we need to come

1052
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,680
to agreement on then that needs to be a

1053
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,740
consensus call from the from the uh

1054
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,020
working group and you know what goes in

1055
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,020
is the working group consensus so uh you

1056
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,520
know as long as things are moving slowly

1057
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,460
uh let's uh as long as things are moving

1058
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,760
smoothly let's keep going on this but if

1059
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,200
we get to a point where there's

1060
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,819
something that there's some disagreement

1061
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:39,240
on let's not jump to to doing it let's

1062
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,060
let's take the time to uh to get a to

1063
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,619
get a working group decision on those

1064
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:45,780
things okay

1065
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,579
the good technical ways of doing that is

1066
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,140
to make it a pull request that you can

1067
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,339
then share on the list and then people

1068
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,440
can see exactly what the text is that

1069
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,359
you're proposing or arguing about

1070
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,760
and we can actually even walk through

1071
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,800
those in fact that's what I would

1072
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,119
propose we do in our next virtual

1073
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,640
interim is that we literally just share

1074
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,640
the GitHub page that's on the screen now

1075
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,640
um and you know if there's wordsmithing

1076
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,800
or arguments about that then we just

1077
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,380
will do that right we don't need uh we

1078
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,180
don't need slideware is what I'm saying

1079
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,740
yeah yeah

1080
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,260
yeah I think the amount of changes that

1081
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,140
are left are easy enough to do in in

1082
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,880
small pull requests like that so

1083
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,980
completely understand the amount of text

1084
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,480
that we were doing for draft zero was

1085
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,220
very hard to summarize and pull request

1086
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,400
but yes I can do that and yeah that

1087
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,740
that's fine so we're we're beyond that

1088
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,960
now and and let's let's just kind of try

1089
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,300
and uh just kind of try and use that

1090
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,200
philosophy going forward

1091
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,319
should we done

1092
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,940
I think we're done is there any other

1093
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,079
business for the working group

1094
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,200
everyone is going twice

1095
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,000

1098
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,160

your laptop open I just

1119
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,240
close mind before I actually thought

1120
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,479
about it

1121
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,578

1128
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,720
um because my Visa to remain couldn't

1129
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,859
remain as long as I thought it could

1130
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,720
that's all I'll say on the cycles and

1131
