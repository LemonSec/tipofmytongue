1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,240
foreign

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,099
I think um it's noon let's get started

3
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,120
uh this is the Friday the last set of

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,000
meetings so brave souls are here

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,860
um and if you are for Content delivery

6
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,480
Networks interconnection

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,100
working group session then you're at the

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,260
right place

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,879
um so let's get started

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,160
let's start with the note well as you

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,899
are all familiar with it and you've

12
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,600
probably seen this all through the week

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,659
and uh just a couple of points just to

14
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,880
still remind you that you but

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,520
participating here you agreed to follow

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,040
the idea of processes and policies

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,680
with respect to contributions

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,540
and if you have any patent on anything

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,600
that you are working on you must declare

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,899
that

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,299
um and also code of conduct is

22
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,280
um you've got to follow that as laid out

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,180
in the note well

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,880
okay

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,520
um that said

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,799
let's move on to

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
a couple of tips again this is really

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,759
redundant if you've been here all week

29
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,240
then um you know everything here

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,060
and uh just a reminder though that you

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,799
got to wear your masks

32
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,600
unless actively speaking at the

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,460
microphone here

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,259
and also

35
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,020
so you've got some rules for the in in

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,060
person participants

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,540
make sure that you use the meat Echo

38
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,899
and to make sure that you are signed on

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,220
I don't think we have that on a display

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,560
here uh

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,520
and I didn't include that in my um

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,580
meeting presentation that that you can

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,680
scan that outside the room if you enter

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,239
the room there's a scanner there that

45
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,640
you can scan in

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,540
um

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,120
and also if anybody that's uh remote

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,220
you're already in so you already are

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,720
pretty familiar with you know your audio

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
video functions and if you have any

51
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,260
questions make sure that you raise hence

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,220
to get into the queue

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,720
okay and again a couple of other

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,280
resources that if you need to go find

55
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,900
um and then with that said

56
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,220
um

57
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,720
Kevin we want to walk through this or

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
shall we just go through the agenda

59
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,000
first and then come back here

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,720
um yeah so uh since last time we met in

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
Philadelphia

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,980

67
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,459
right up and

68
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,180

69
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,800

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,940
awesome thank you

71
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,019
and we also did the call for adoption

72
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,599
for the capacity draft

73
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,659
um Andrew and Ben are here to talk about

74
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,860
it

75
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,620
um otherwise we're hoping to get the

76
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,980
Acme star delegation done very soon I

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,080
saw the new draft is out from Frederick

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,599
I provided some comments this morning

79
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,580
I think we're pretty close to getting

80
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,040
that out and hopefully we'll get that

81
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,400
submitted shortly after this ietf

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,860
and then of course we lost the slides

83
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,420
Sanjay yeah I just realized that um

84
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,099
so no worries

85
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,360
let me go back again

86
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,220
we still have a couple of other things

87
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,680
work in progress the

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,460
um

89
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,780

90
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,620
um the update to uh the triggers

91
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,199
interface which I think Sun is going to

92
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,440
talk about

93
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,199

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,100

99
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,740

all right so let's look at the agenda

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,440

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,680

okay so that being said we've got uh

115
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,720
four

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,780
working group drafts that are active so

117
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,080
we want to walk through uh these four

118
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,620
and then we've got a update from Chris

119

and we've also allocated some time on

123
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,900
open mic and I see Ellen Earl which has

124
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,940
joined so he might be able to use that

125
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,860
time to

126
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,680

128
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,259

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,180
so so far we have changed

174
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,780
um

175
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,300
a few things

176
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,819
in the last version which is a 12

177
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,180
version

178
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,759
um we clarify the abstract

179
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,419
um

180
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,679
into better give an overview on the Acme

181
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,940
delegation

182
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,059
when you rename the object

183
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,580
that we are dealing with in the in the

184
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,860
draft

185
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,740
uh we change also the figure

186
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,120
on the bootstrapping or flow so

187
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,820
hopefully now it's getting clearer on

188
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,459
that too

189
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:00,619
and we collected various typos next time

190
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,339
also we made

191
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,060
um

192
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,580
we made the

193
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,120
quite a few changes also on the

194
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,180
on the object we are dealing with

195
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,600
according to discussions with uh the RFC

196
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,560
8739 authors so they are uh authoring

197
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,000
the draft on Acme star

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,720
um So based on those discussions uh

199
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,300
so first we added the draft on the

200
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,360
GitHub but we also added some properties

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,019
um

202
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,820
in the Acme delegation objects

203
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,820
to indicate certificates validity window

204
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,760
we also supported now

205
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,680
uh non-star Acme delegations which were

206
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,260
missing and the first versions of this

207
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,839
of the drafts

208
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,880
so it means that we are meaning to

209
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,820
support long-term certificates

210
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,820
uh by by adding so Lifetime and lifetime

211
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,040
adjust properties so according to the

212
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,640
rrc 8739

213
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,040
uh

214
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,300
and we provided examples for both star

215
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,880
and non-start irrigation methods so

216
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,620
hopefully here too it's getting clearer

217
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,899
and finally we added a section on

218
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,399
acknowledgments

219
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,320
next slide

220
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
all right

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,620
so what's next

222
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,339
um

223
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,160
uh so now we are proposing to change the

224
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,820
draft name to cdni metadata for

225
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,500
mitigations which seems uh more accurate

226
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,279
than the current Drive name

227
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,959
and also we are asking now for a bit of

228
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,180
time the working roof last call so

229
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,360
hopefully now it's it's we are reaching

230
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,019
the good good end of the

231
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,779
of the work and so I saw that Kevin

232
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,240
uh already reviewed the draft so

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,579
uh to meet

234
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:30,899
should be now very quick to uh to take

235
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,860
them into account to take the the

236
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,019
comments into account

237
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:40,380
so normally yeah we should

238
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,720
reach the last mine on this

239
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
so thank you

240
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,260
great I

241
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,360
I gotta go back in because I was trying

242
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,260
to scan here log me out

243
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,500
um so give me one second here uh so Fred

244
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,420
um based on

245
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,000
um I I did see email from Kevin where

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,920
Kevin has responded back

247
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,959
um with some nits and there are a couple

248
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,560
of uh key comments also on some of the

249
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,800
design so I guess uh you gotta follow up

250
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,160
on that yeah I think it's uh

251
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,860
it's doable for for the next few few

252
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,720
weeks

253
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,839
okay yeah I I did this pre-sheperd

254
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,579
review I I think it's in pretty good

255
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,980
shape it's it's much it's much better

256
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,260
than the previous version uh so thank

257
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,700
you for that

258
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,620
um there there were a couple of comments

259
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,040
I had the Json example doesn't match

260
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,920
what is specified so we need to clean

261
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,139
that up and then I think we could still

262
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,240
beef up the security considerations a

263
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,339
little bit but um

264
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,220
otherwise I think it's in pretty close

265
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,860
shape uh thank you for all the work I

266
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,360
think we can probably get to working

267
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,720
group last call before the next ietf

268
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,180
um once the next version comes out

269
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,519
yeah hopefully it should be it should be

270
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,560
done for the next ITF yes

271
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,760
any questions so far

272
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,380
thank you thank you

273
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
[Music]

274
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,579
okay

275
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,779
um I think next on the agenda

276
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,100
we have

277
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,079
Guillaume

278
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,940
let's see if I can bring up the slides

279
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,120
here

280
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:54,740
can you hear me yes good

281
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,700
so

282
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,220
yeah I'm presenting the um this

283
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,779
contribution on behalf of Christoph that

284
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,940
could not join today

285
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,899
um

286
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,420
by the way in France today it's a half

287
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,139
day it's a holiday

288
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,040
um

289
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
okay so

290
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,700
um let's go with this draft so can I uh

291
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,579
can I control the rust the slice from a

292
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:30,199
remote how does it work

293
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,979
to

294
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,779
yeah can I control the slides

295
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,339
um let me move ahead I think maybe just

296
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,540
easier um yeah okay yeah yeah

297
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,019
um okay so um we have a we have had our

298
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,440
a couple of six changes between um there

299
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,959
have been a couple of exchanges between

300
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,800
uh Christoph and uh

301
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,880
Kevin I think

302
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,060
um I'm

303
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,880
they ended up with this uh Drive ITF

304
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,760
cdnis GPS delegation subset zero zero

305
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,860
and there was something

306
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,500
um it was not completely satisfactory

307
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,959
because it somehow

308
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,000
um used FCI for something that was not

309
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,540
designed for

310
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,680
um so

311
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,680
um yeah because with FCI with the object

312
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,660
delegated credentials

313
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,399
um

314
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,519
we we expect from the fcis to announce I

315
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,339
mean to use FCI each time the delegated

316
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,260
credential expired

317
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,120
which wasn't

318
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,760
um not very not really the way we should

319
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,000
have used FCI FCI is used for enhancing

320
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,820
exposing the capabilities and not really

321
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,199
to

322
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,079
you know to use as a channel for for

323
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,260
entire kind of interactive protocols or

324
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,940
such kind of things so that was not this

325
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,899
was not really satisfactory right and um

326
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,600
yeah and anyway we had that was a state

327
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,940
last that was a step so far and there

328
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,519
has been a proposal to to try to uh you

329
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,100
know correct this this main default if I

330
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,380
can name it like that so can you go to

331
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,040
the next slide

332
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,820
yeah

333
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,380
um so basically that's what we have

334
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,380
today we have two objects in FCI we have

335
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,320
a currently in the in the draft right we

336
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,920
have an FCI an object that is used to um

337
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,560
to express for for the downstream CDN to

338
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,880
uh Express the needs or let's say

339
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,000
the need of uh I mean the the capacity

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,480
of inject of uh ingesting uh a certain

341
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,579
number of delegated connections so that

342
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,720
means here free means you can sign me up

343
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,300
to free dedicated credential and I I

344
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,980
will know how to deal with it that's

345
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,320
more or less what it means but and and

346
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,820
the only on the other

347
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,540
um

348
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,399
on the delegated credential object the

349
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,100
Mi object the configuration object that

350
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,679
was um up to the mcdm to send this

351
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,559
delegated credentials right uh according

352
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,160
uh to the number uh requested by the by

353
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,559
uh the downstream CDN I mean requested

354
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,880
yeah and

355
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,459
announced exposed

356
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,140
so yeah next slide

357
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,079
yeah so as I told as explained so in

358
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,460
slide I yeah I'll explain it's a

359
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,860
it's not SEI should not be used as a

360
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,440
kind of uh signaling protocol it's not

361
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,360
it's more about signaling and announcing

362
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,820
the capabilities and more than using it

363
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,799
for signaling so that's that was the

364
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,260
drawback of this method Kevin purpose

365
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,360
one thing was to completely remove the

366
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,039
FCI object

367
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,740
and instead he proposed to rely on

368
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,960
on well

369
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
only on dedicated credential objects and

370
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,039
operating

371
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,880
um yeah and uh

372
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,760
it was well the proposal from Kevin was

373
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
based on the fact that the

374
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,960
metadata Mi metadata results on the

375
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,900
Upstream side and it was its proposal

376
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,419
was based on the fact that

377
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,320
um the downstairs CDN can download and

378
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,080
fetch the the configuration at any time

379
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,960
this is uh and and it was and this

380
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,580
proposal was also based on the fact that

381
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,980
we could um we could

382
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,299
um uh let's say uh relates

383
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,980
uh objects in the configuration

384
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,200
um metadata we can we can operate uh how

385
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
do we call that links I don't remember

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,280
exactly the names but it was based on

387
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,500
this but we are we have a problem with

388
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,720
this proposal because

389
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,740
um first in svta we don't

390
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,400
um

391
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,940
we don't support links reference links

392
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,660
at least in the first version of it and

393
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,520
furthermore we have two ways to

394
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,220
configure a downstream CDN it can be

395
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,160
either the pull mechanisms like uh like

396
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,600
Kevin was uh you know assume

397
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,700
but we can also use the push mode where

398
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,980
the dance the app stream CDN push the

399
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,700
configuration using a particular

400
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,520
API to do that and in that case the

401
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,400
the anyway the the references the the

402
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,140
link methods you know to reference

403
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,419
object between them are not supported or

404
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:37,740
even forbidden

405
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,299
so

406
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,179
basically your proposal Kevin cannot

407
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,539
work with svta 1.0 at least not in all

408
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,419
modes that's my problem so instead we

409
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,840
have proposed something else to remove

410
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,460
the drawback

411
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,280
brought by operating FCI

412
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,660
uh Beyond its original design so we keep

413
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
we propose to keep this FCI object

414
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,900
but changed but instead we would change

415
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
the sematic attached to this SCI object

416
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,380
so the sci object would now

417
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,160
um

418
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,700
uh in our new proposal would would be

419
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,320
used to um

420
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,059
announce the maximum delegated

421
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,520
credential that we support right

422
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,700
so this is ready and that's it

423
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,260
and um

424
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,840
the FCI won't be used anymore for

425
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,039
announcing

426
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:32,640
um

427
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,039
[Music]

428
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,260
that the

429
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,520
delegated corrosion need to be refreshed

430
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
like like it was like it is today like

431
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,320
it is described today in the in the in

432
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,940
the current draft

433
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,000
no FCI object only used to announce the

434
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,400
maximum number of delegated credentials

435
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
then

436
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,640
the Upstream CDN will use this Mi object

437
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,419
to uh configure a certain number of

438
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,760
delegated credentials it can be

439
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,280
apt it can be it can corresponds to the

440
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,679
maximum number advertised by the uh by

441
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,780
the transfer CDN through SCI or it can

442
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,520
be less right

443
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,100
it can be only for example one so it

444
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,900
doesn't change from what we have

445
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,520
described already in this in the spec

446
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,299
and the when the

447
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,179
when the uh the credentials the

448
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,700
delegated commercial is going to expire

449
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,799
it's not the downstream cdns to manage

450
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,960
that it's up to the Upstream cdns to

451
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,559
manage this and to a recent

452
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,780
um

453
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,340
reconfigure the downstream cgn with a

454
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,320
new delegate we will refresh our new

455
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,640
dedicated credential you know because

456
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,380
the previous one because it knows the

457
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,080
absence DN is supposed to know exactly

458
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,600
um the the live situation of the

459
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,880
validity of a of a delegated commercial

460
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
and it is it will be up to the Upstream

461
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,620
CDM to refresh it and to re reconfigure

462
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,020
it that's basically our proposal

463
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,659
hopefully I was uh clear enough for you

464
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,240
to understand and now I'm open to

465
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,799
questions oh

466
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,059
um I see near in the queue uh Neil go

467
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,240
ahead

468
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,620
what is the method how the

469
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
uh

470
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,080
sorry

471
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,760
[Music]

472
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,100
that's okay

473
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,100
a

474
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,960
how what is the person do for the

475
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,179
after student to update or a

476
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,159
extend the credential to the dancer

477
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,440
today and is it using that figures

478
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,000
interface for example or

479
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,080
it used the basically we call it the

480
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,720
configuration method in svta we have two

481
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,400
ways to configure the downstream CN

482
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,620
right so either you can use the trigger

483
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,600
interface or you can use this simple

484
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,640
what we've defined as a simple

485
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,740
configuration interface which is

486
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,860
basically a you know a put

487
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,880
interface and it's a rest uh put

488
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
interface right where you just provide

489
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
the the complete configuration uh

490
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,380
structure or a part of the configuration

491
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,080
structure right

492
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,179
so you can you can you can do that in

493
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,280
such a way that you can just modify the

494
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,320
part of the configuration and and

495
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,000
including for example if you want to

496
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,559
refresh the

497
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,340
yeah and it allows also the removal of

498
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,080
the yeah the interface allows to

499
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,960
it allows to remove and it allows to

500
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,200
modify uh the configuration

501
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,940
um yeah the downstream configuration

502
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,159
all right I I'm transferred I'm in the

503
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,820
queue next I'll go um near you good

504
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,320
okay um the the only question I have is

505
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,640
that

506
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,240
asking the ucdn to know the renewal

507
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,440
period

508
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,179
that might be a little bit more tricky

509
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,580
for the ucdn to kind of try to keep

510
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,140
track of this

511
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm I'm just wondering if the design

512
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,059
should take into consideration where the

513
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,000
downstream CDN is responsible for

514
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,919
knowing when the certificate expires and

515
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,780
it makes a request to fetch a new

516
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,000
certificate rather than relying on the

517
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Upstream CDN to remember this and send

518
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,080
it down

519
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,659
yeah I understand and that was part of

520
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:46,980
the problem right

521
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,320
um we have to find a compromise right

522
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,880
it's a trade-off

523
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,299
and uh we've been against

524
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,419
um created and and and designing a new

525
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,000
interface because for what you what you

526
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
are saying Sanjay we need a new

527
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,419
interface and at the beginning we've

528
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,240
proposed this new interface but it was

529
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,860
too much we thought that we could do

530
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,320
without this new interface then we have

531
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,580
this um IDs of operating the FCI as a

532
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,539
kind of return channel for a kind of you

533
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:19,200
know

534
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,539
like a bit that we used to do that for

535
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,520
also for capacity inside for example so

536
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,340
but it was FCI has not been designed for

537
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,640
that and again I agree with this as a

538
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,260
as

539
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,640
with this um

540
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,500
with this conclusion with this remark

541
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,840
and um

542
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,419
then then we have this problem it means

543
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,360
it requires the Upstream CDN yes too but

544
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,580
frankly the opportunity then asked to

545
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,620
know what he's doing right so if it's if

546
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,419
it's if it's as created delegated

547
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,520
credential it's a it has to manage that

548
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,520
right you cannot let credentials like

549
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,700
you know without you know so that's a

550
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,279
that's a trade-off if you watch the uh

551
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,799
the downstream cdns to to take care of

552
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,400
the uh of the refresh by the way

553
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
I think the downswing CDN will take care

554
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,200
anyway so if the dance team CJ knows

555
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,000
that the uh that the the the negative

556
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,860
connection is going to expire

557
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,380
and that is nothing has been sent for

558
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,120
you know refreshing that dedicated

559
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,220
credentiality will take care of it don't

560
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,919
worry the thing is that

561
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,580
um

562
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,100
we don't have mechanisms to because we

563
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,539
don't want a new interface so we just

564
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,940
have to you know rely on the Upstream

565
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,980
CDN just to do its job and if you cannot

566
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,080
do it in time there will be something

567
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,400
else

568
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,380
you know probably I don't know how but

569
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,860
exactly but we have we have we have a we

570
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,600
have different methods it's it's more

571
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,120
about implementation uh issue here right

572
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,460
if for example a dedicated only one

573
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,200
delegated connection is renewal and on

574
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,760
the overs then we can share the

575
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
delegated credential among all the

576
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,820
servers for example it's one way to cope

577
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,039
with the problem of having the option

578
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,799
CDN just late or just you know such kind

579
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,260
of things so we we may have methods

580
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,279
right

581
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,900
but uh

582
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,080
yeah I won't I we thought that we should

583
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,120
try to be simple as simple as possible

584
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,460
so

585
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,679
this proposal is quite simple

586
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,960
doesn't solve everything it it has some

587
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,179
burden it provides some it has some

588
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,580
disadvantages because for the swims

589
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,679
again that like you said this obliged to

590
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,900
follow it to track this and this refresh

591
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,679
period and to resonate but anyway uh the

592
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,299
absence then will have to work anyway

593
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,539
we'll have to provide new even if the

594
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:40,980
downswing CDN manage this expression and

595
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,799
request somehow to the options here a

596
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,840
new delegation credential

597
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,880
the the options here will have to deal

598
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,380
with that anyway so

599
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,400
okay

600
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,640
yeah thanks um Kevin

601
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,760
I guess I'm I'm still not understanding

602
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,220
if the

603
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,760
why the metadata doesn't work by itself

604
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,279
right the the downstream CDN can

605
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,760
re-request the metadata or the Upstream

606
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,860
CDN can use triggered pull we support

607
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,919
triggering refresh of metadata so there

608
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,380
are mechanisms built into cdni to do

609
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,240
this whether or not

610
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,039
they're they're your preferred method

611
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,260
there are mechanisms and and if you want

612
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,539
to build a separate mechanism outside of

613
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,919
it and have a different configuration

614
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,539
interface that's fine

615
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,779
um that's that's not really uh within

616
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,640
scope here but but it doesn't really

617
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,679
matter but I guess I still don't

618
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,419
understand why pulling the metadata

619
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,880
itself is not enough now I don't mind I

620
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,480
think if you have a new FCI object that

621
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,179
but that's not really the issue here

622
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,539
right well putting the metadata is one

623
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,460
of the things that has been the basis of

624
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,840
dcdni RFC but we are adding a new

625
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,700
possibility that will also be part of

626
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,400
cdni somehow I think

627
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,679
because it's part of our proposal to

628
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,740
modify to add some features in cdni and

629
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,919
this one of the feature is that the

630
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,440
metadata is not only pull is also pushed

631
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,400
right

632
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,500
so that's that's enchant that much right

633
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,380
it's just that uh pooling is just an

634
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,480
option it's not the only one that's that

635
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,799
that's that's my problem

636
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,020
and triggered poles not as good as a

637
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,159
push

638
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,760
no

639
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,100
that's the concretely when we start to

640
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,620
develop the

641
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,520
the fact that the Upstream CDN needs to

642
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,279
keep

643
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,940
I mean keep the metadata and and

644
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,340
continuously and await the the pull

645
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,919
method I mean the pull request to served

646
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
it was uh it was viewed as a sometimes

647
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
problematic and the first implementation

648
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,260
does did not do that see just the

649
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,760
reliably on the

650
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,899
yeah

651
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,299
I guess I'm still not understanding how

652
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,580
that affects this particular draft right

653
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,559
even if you had push support for

654
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,020
metadata to force it to update the

655
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,120
metadata object itself doesn't change

656
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,919
necessarily

657
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,679
um and so if we did add that support

658
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,380
later whether you implement the outside

659
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,779
cdni or cdni implements the ability to

660
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,480
push new metadata it shouldn't change

661
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,100
this particular object or this

662
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,559
particular use case

663
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,419
right

664
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,919
so

665
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,659
so I mean we should still be able to

666
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,880
Define in this draft what information is

667
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,200
needed and how to use it and if we add

668
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,760
another and we could even specify a

669
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,460
triggered pull and you know that sort of

670
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,140
thing and if we add something new in the

671
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,600
future then it should also be supported

672
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,000
I guess

673
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,100
yeah

674
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,679
I'm okay with that

675
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,340
um it's I'm just it can be an option so

676
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,559
then we can have two ways as two ways I

677
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,480
have no I have no problems we just wants

678
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,520
to bring our option here I still have

679
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,799
valid options that's my point

680
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,799
right okay so so if I went understood

681
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
you are saying that we should keep maybe

682
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,720
both as two possibilities to uh control

683
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,779
the the uh refreshing of the delegated

684
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:19,919
commercial right that's what you're

685
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,120
saying

686
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,820
the first one being based on on what you

687
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,260
proposed

688
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,899
and the second one be based on what we

689
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,379
proposed

690
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,460
possibly yes I'd want to see the text

691
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,120
but in theory that that doesn't break

692
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,399
anything

693
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:41,220
what do you think about our proposal our

694
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,480
changes our proposal

695
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,940
um I'm sorry is there a new draft I

696
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,740
haven't I haven't read it no we didn't

697
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,360
have times to submit a new draft so

698
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,220
basically you have the ID on the on the

699
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,539
ballet number two

700
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,399
um I don't know I don't think I can make

701
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,500
that great comment right now it was

702
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,600
based on what I wait I tried to explain

703
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,520
what which what we put the change that

704
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,100
we propose to bring in this ground draft

705
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,440
so basically what we are saying that

706
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,740
FCI object is still there but it is not

707
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,700
used to manage the exploration it is

708
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,320
just used to announce the maximum number

709
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,240
of delegated credential that the

710
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,039
downstream CNC port

711
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,659
all right yeah I don't have a problem

712
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,179
with that that I don't know

713
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,860
and then the rest is managed by the

714
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,620
Upstream CDN with the Mi object

715
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,380
yeah I think Alfred also has a comment

716
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,880
so maybe

717
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,520
um it's it's certainly I think this

718
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,039
issue we need to you know maybe reply

719
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,720
back a little bit more you know in the

720
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,820
mailing list and talk through this to to

721
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,120
make sure it's clear the path you know I

722
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
understand that FCI is making requests

723
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,860
you know FCI why you're using it but we

724
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,840
still are not clear on some of the the

725
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,460
design that you have in number two so

726
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,960
let's let's take it on the mailing list

727
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,520
also

728
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,899
um Fred yeah

729
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,299
I had a question for the working group I

730
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:14,100
was wondering if the FCI objects we

731
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,240
Define in both draft I mean the bus

732
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,700
delegation draft on like Mr and the

733
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,460
delegated credential draft should be a

734
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,240
line that means that we should have the

735
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,140
same way of defining things

736
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,779
so is it important to have a both draft

737
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,100
a line on this or not

738
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,559
um I'll I'll respond to that at least um

739
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,659
and Kevin can also chime in

740
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,100
um I

741
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,980
technically it would be easier if this

742
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,380
draft follows the

743
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,220
uh how the delegation is is using these

744
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,360
Acme

745
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,279
delegation where you have the FCI and

746
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,919
also using the metadata interface to

747
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,380
request

748
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,099
updates from Upstream CDN so

749
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:11,159
logically it seems like you know the

750
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,460
delegated credentials can follow the

751
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,980
same mechanism but

752
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,659
um I don't think we want to make a

753
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,780
decision about that here particularly

754
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,239
um definitely need to talk this through

755
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,219
more in the mailing list

756
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,460
to see if other there are other ideas

757
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,980
but it seems like it would be easier if

758
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,520
this this draft also follows the the

759
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,980
previous version I mean the the other

760
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,560
draft

761
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,659
I I think it would be nice but I think

762
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,219
in this case they have an additional

763
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,800
parameter it's not just an enable enable

764
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,418
disable

765
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,119
um does it is it supported or not they

766
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,119
also want to supply a an integer

767
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,339
parameter which doesn't fit within the

768
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:57,780
same model

769
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,380
um

770
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,660
but I think we could we can think about

771
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,960
that

772
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,400
okay thank you I think that that was the

773
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,920
intent of my original comment was to to

774
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,720
align them but if they're if that

775
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,060
doesn't work for them then obviously we

776
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,020
come up with a different method

777
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,579
yeah agree

778
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:24,060
it doesn't I mean the the SEO object is

779
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,520
slightly different at least for now

780
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,400
so whether to merge or not the two FCI

781
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
object in one is is really a similar

782
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,140
read to me just like let's try first to

783
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,540
resolve the

784
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,579
the

785
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:39,720
mechanisms right and then we can discuss

786
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
about merging on a

787
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,420
I think to be clear Fred is not not

788
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,579
asking to merge he was sort of

789
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,020
suggesting if if could this uh delegated

790
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,500
credentials follow the the pattern

791
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,960
for the Acme delegation but it it could

792
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,060
but it doesn't have to

793
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,640
um but I so I I'm not sure just to be

794
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,859
clear Fred is not asking for merge so I

795
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,040
was not sure if you're no mercy object

796
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,500
so what is a button they don't have an

797
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,200
FCI object they don't have a custom FCI

798
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,900
object they're using the existing

799
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,900
metadata FCI object just to advertise

800
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,480
that there is support for Acme

801
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,040
delegation

802
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,140
yeah exactly they don't have to pass any

803
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,140
other information other than yeah so

804
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,000
then there is no point right we have an

805
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,980
FCI object so for the moment there is no

806
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,160
point

807
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,680
okay I think um Fred's question is can

808
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,420
you also get away with just using the

809
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,420
existing metadata object to it advertise

810
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,060
enabling disabling without the need for

811
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,460
um passing the parameter the max

812
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,680
um credentials which is my original

813
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,720
question but if that's not the case then

814
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,839
yeah of course no but we can't right we

815
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,119
need this uh maximum for the moment I

816
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,640
mean if we end up with uh removing these

817
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,980
parameters then of course but for the

818
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,359
moment we need this parameter right

819
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,520
okay give them anything more on your

820
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,859
slides or this is the previous one or

821
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,180
the last one I guess

822
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,400
no that's it

823
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,720
okay

824
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,379
thank you

825
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,780
let's see so we have

826
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,160
Andy

827
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,000
your next

828
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,359
all right everyone hear me uh clearly

829
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,680
yes

830
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,260
all right

831
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,660
so uh Sanjay thanks for putting together

832
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,440
the slide deck uh appreciate it uh

833
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,339
so

834
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,140
I'm on here with uh Ben Rosenbloom as

835
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,160
well

836
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,460
um we're here to discuss some updates on

837
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,460
the our progress on the capacity

838
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,740
signaling component uh that we're

839
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,959
proposing uh next slide please Sanjay

840
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,880
so I mean just to highlight without

841
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,140
reading through the slide the the

842
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,079
overall goal here is to allow a

843
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,339
mechanism

844
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,220
for delegation Partners to understand

845
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,740
how much traffic is appropriate to

846
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,380
delegate I think this was a topic that

847
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,040
was deferred from some of the original

848
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,320
uh cdni specifications uh probably due

849
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,540
to some of the complexity

850
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,460
um but it's definitely

851
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,500
in practice something that is identified

852
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,320
as being a key component to making sure

853
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,560
that the traffic steering is done in in

854
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,200
an intelligent manner

855
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,960
um we wanted to you know make sure that

856
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,540
the signaling that is done though is

857
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,220
specific to the Upstream in the

858
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,140
downstream

859
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,900
um the limits are not ambiguous so

860
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,380
that's the limits that are defined

861
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,560
aren't calculated independently by each

862
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,119
uh participant

863
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,300
uh there's a common source of data that

864
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,300
is being used to measure utilization and

865
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,920
then also tracking limits against that

866
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,140
utilization

867
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,460
um

868
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,420
yeah next slide please

869
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,280
so

870
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,260
some of the the points that have been

871
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,440
raised on the mailing list are you know

872
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,180
points that have come up in some of the

873
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,040
discussions the one main point of

874
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,960
contention I think with this model

875
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,940
is

876
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,520
we've identified is what we've declined

877
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,119
as a subscope within an FCI payload so

878
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,859
to take a quick step back what we're

879
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,900
proposing how we're proposing to

880
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,599
accommodate this workflow is we're

881
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,300
creating a new FCI payload and the

882
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,740
reason why we wanted to take this

883
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,359
approach is FCI was very aligned with

884
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,839
the concept of of capacity signaling

885
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,940
particularly the fact that the FCI

886
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,720
object is tied to a footprint and the

887
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,859
footprints are very readily tied to

888
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:14,880
infrastructure underneath that the

889
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,119
downstream cdns would be advertising

890
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,579
um or supporting capacity from so it

891
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,060
there was a very strong case to leverage

892
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,400
FCI for this purpose

893
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,920
when we got into some of the use cases

894
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,820
though

895
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,820
we found that

896
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,700
the FCI footprint may not be as granular

897
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,760
as we'd like a particular use case is if

898
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,740
you've got a Upstream CDN

899
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,040
who is attempting to delegate

900
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,740
um a wide portfolio of traffic to the

901
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,960
downstream for example the Upstream CDN

902
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,000
is dealing with a game download company

903
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,480
a streaming company a website company

904
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,680
all of which though all of those traffic

905
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,579
portfolios are very different

906
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,460
um whereas the downstream CDN may want

907
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,000
to provide limits specific to that

908
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,240
traffic to a particular traffic type I.E

909
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,060
you know you will allow x amount of

910
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,579
gigabits per second of your game traffic

911
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,740
but if you're going to start sending us

912
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,480
and delegating

913
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,599
um low latency hls uh traffic to us

914
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,579
which would have you know potentially a

915
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,859
much higher request per second portfolio

916
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,660
that may be something the downstream

917
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,480
cdns want to signal in a more granular

918
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,619
manner

919
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:35,220
to accomplish this while we proposed in

920
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,820
the new FCI uh capacity limits object

921
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,320
we're creating is the definition of a of

922
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,560
a scope and that scope would essentially

923
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,859
live within inside of the the payload it

924
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:51,359
would be encompassed within the

925
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,339
footprint it would live inside the

926
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,980
payload and would allow for a granular a

927
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,320
more granular definition of what does

928
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,540
the limit that we're proposing apply to

929
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,780
within the greater footprint

930
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,760
some of the identifiers we've linked in

931
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,579
there are the published toast and then

932
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,240
two other identifiers which kind of link

933
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,460
and point or are meant to reference

934
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,560
specific configurations on the

935
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,839
downstream CDN

936
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,780
um

937
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,480
as Kevin has pointed out that's

938
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,079
you know not necessarily A I guess a

939
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,020
standard practice uh there's some

940
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,420
ambiguity in there or there's a sense of

941
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,640
ambiguity in there we tried to address

942
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,000
that in the specification by kind of

943
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,220
coming up with guidelines on how this

944
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,740
scope object should be evaluated and

945
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,839
it's you know it the end of the day is

946
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,780
really boils down to all requirements

947
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,140
need to be evaluated and accounted for

948
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,300
um it's not an order of Precedence per

949
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,520
se it's not a or a logical or it's an

950
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,619
and you know everything has to be to be

951
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,359
met at this point

952
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,240
um we provided on the the mailing list

953
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,480
an example of you know a payload what it

954
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,300
would look like with some of the scoping

955
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,859
defined

956
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,119
um

957
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,339
so I guess the that seems to be one of

958
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,200
the biggest points of discussion here

959
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,540
that we're hoping to kind of raise up

960
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,780
and solicit some feedback on

961
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,579
uh Sandra I'm not sure if there's any

962
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,740
additional slides at this point but I

963
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,359
think that was probably one of the

964
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:32,160
biggest things we wanted to talk about

965
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,119
here

966
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,060
oh okay here we go sorry sorry I jumped

967
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,380
ahead and your slide deck

968
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,480
so at this point um I I guess we opened

969
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,420
the floor for uh conversation Kevin I

970
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,160
think particularly you in particular

971
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,440
um thanks yeah uh thanks for the email

972
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,000
thanks for clarifying that I think I

973
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,300
understand what we're trying to do now

974
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,000
um I was actually just thinking with the

975
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,880
new footprint Union type and the

976
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,780
clarification we do have the ability to

977
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,380
now specify this as Footprints I think

978
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,300
right

979
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,520
um and if we added a new footprint type

980
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,780
which

981
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,800
was you know the the host or or some

982
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,079
something related to how it how it's

983
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,520
being retrieved it would be really nice

984
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,740
I agree if it related to the metadata

985
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,480
host that would be cool

986
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,859
um I don't know if there's a good way to

987
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:34,740
hard link that it's possible

988
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,660
um because we do have the the link

989
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,640
references from metadata or if we just

990
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,400
wanted to make it you know this should

991
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,960
match up with something and figure out

992
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,520
how to do it we could always put that in

993
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,420
there

994
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,980
um and that's a detail we can figure out

995
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,859
but I think that I I think that makes

996
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,619
sense it makes it makes a lot of sense

997
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:55,560
and we didn't consider it originally

998
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,240
um I think there's probably still a way

999
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,280
we can we can do it with Footprints I

1000
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,780
think I originally was thinking it

1001
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,359
wasn't a footprint thing but now that I

1002
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,859
understand what we're talking about it

1003
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:09,240
feels okay it seems somewhat natural

1004
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,940
um so I I would be in favor of exploring

1005
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,339
that route

1006
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,740
I I mean I don't want to speak for the

1007
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,960
larger group but I I feel like that

1008
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,720
makes sense as well because

1009
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,300
the it makes sense and the only other

1010
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,740
Counterpoint I'd say where it could be

1011
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,020
challenging right is

1012
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,060
when we're dealing with what is the

1013
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,800
delegation model now typically like

1014
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,740
we've been highly focused on like the

1015
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,540
DNS delegation model at which the most

1016
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,300
granular delegation element would be DNS

1017
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,420
uh we really can't get in a host at that

1018
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,619
point so

1019
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,619
for example if there's a client where

1020
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,020
there's multiple traffic types served

1021
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,520
under the same public shows like slash

1022
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,280
live you know LL live is low latency

1023
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,619
live and you got regular live alongside

1024
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,500
it and website delivery that within that

1025
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,180
delegation model there really is no

1026
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,280
option anyway so you kind of have to

1027
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,619
give a Car Blanc

1028
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,480
um you would you would have to the most

1029
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,000
granular the downstream CDN would be

1030
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,040
able to

1031
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,380
make a delineation on would be the DNS

1032
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,760
name but when we start dealing with

1033
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,700
https you know 302 redirection models

1034
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,420
then the path could become relevant then

1035
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,920
um I guess where I'm going with this is

1036
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,020
there there there's a little bit of a

1037
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,520
Nuance there including it in the

1038
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,960
footprint but actually now that I'm

1039
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,359
talking it out loud I still think it's

1040
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,700
it's relevant and it does make sense to

1041
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,520
try and add that identifier into the

1042
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,359
footprint as well

1043
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,599
I'll let Chris get into the Q ICM at the

1044
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,400
mic

1045
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,980
the uh uh

1046
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,400
seconding the footprint the the

1047
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,960
I think you're right that you're not

1048
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,060
going to be able to

1049
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,800
in many cases you won't have enough

1050
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,960
information to determine exactly where

1051
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,819
in the footprint someone Falls

1052
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:02,099
but that's not unique to just what kind

1053
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,339
of uh content they're requesting uh

1054
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,980
there's a number of cases where you're

1055
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,920
never going to be 100 certain where in

1056
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,240
the footprint and you just have to do

1057
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,200
your best

1058
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,400
so I think this approach makes sense and

1059
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,079
the the footprint solves the problem

1060
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,819
more neatly than the other Solutions

1061
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:23,480
we've looked at

1062
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:27,960
okay

1063
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,619
thank you

1064
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,339
anyone else have any comments on on this

1065
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,280
if not I encourage you to read through

1066
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,040
the the comment thread on the list I

1067
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,720
didn't know it was late last night early

1068
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,220
this morning

1069
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,599
um for folks uh get in on that uh

1070
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,660
but otherwise uh I'll just uh I'll just

1071
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,060
come up and say that I also like the

1072
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,460
footprint solution and I think it's just

1073
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,380
that we just didn't consider it at all

1074
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,140
when we were initially dropping this I

1075
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,760
think uh you know when we started on

1076
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,140
this the

1077
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,260
footprint extensions uh and footprint

1078
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,560
unions weren't a thing yet

1079
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,500
um so I I I do think that it would fit

1080
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,760
into that model very nicely

1081
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:19,980
awesome

1082
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,579
great

1083
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,760
sorry uh I apologize uh uh when we say

1084
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,720
Footprints do we mean uh

1085
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,680
I think there are two interpretational

1086
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,060
footprints

1087
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,660
uh that we use in cdni and one is that's

1088
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,700
a kind of a set of cash resources and

1089
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,300
another set of users or users which one

1090
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,819
of those is being used here

1091
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,579
this is the the footprint that is

1092
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:53,760
the the part of the definition of an FCI

1093
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,060
uh payload so it's literally that you

1094
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,680
know in the Json object right you've got

1095
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,480
the FCI components at the top and then

1096
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,819
the footprint underneath it and it's you

1097
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,160
know the whether it's the cider slash

1098
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,040
you know the decider address the ASN the

1099
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,040
geoip or the the geolocation component

1100
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,099
of it uh right down on the slide to the

1101
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,319
the right there Alan on the bottom the

1102
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,119
footprints component that's what we're

1103
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,920
talking about there

1104
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,140
I get it what I said what I'm saying we

1105
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,500
never really disambiguated uh this

1106
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,520
distinction

1107
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,260
and and that's something we discussed in

1108
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,260
the uh in our kind of name Footprints

1109
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,599
the discussions in the CTA is that

1110
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,220
really in cdni they're implicit to

1111
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,619
different Footprints one is a footprint

1112
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,619
of users that are being addressed right

1113
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,060
and you define them the way you define

1114
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,359
them asns what have you right or you

1115
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,880
define a set of caches so I just want to

1116
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,460
make sure that really is a first

1117
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,500
but when you when you say what you mean

1118
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,180
understand the definitions but again

1119
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,660
this doesn't help it still can be both

1120
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,099
what you mean from capability point of

1121
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,579
view you're saying for these users

1122
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:09,540
the this limits apply

1123
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,400
yeah okay I see what you're saying about

1124
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,060
is the Nuance right so the

1125
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,839
the down in this case right it's

1126
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,359
the downstream CDN is saying

1127
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,119
we're allowing for

1128
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,339
is really a nuance and I think this is

1129
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,800
kind of the point that Chris was coming

1130
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,300
up with right is

1131
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,540
you're either kind of explicitly all of

1132
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,920
this at the end of the day is really

1133
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,099
measured

1134
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:41,700
by where the user is located right so

1135
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,460
even when the downstream is saying I'm

1136
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,339
advertising you know support on this ASN

1137
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,940
or this slash 24 at the end of the day

1138
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,500
it really is

1139
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,440
tied back to a geoip lookup of the end

1140
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,339
users information right or if there's

1141
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,920
some other you know method that you can

1142
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,040
discern from where the eyeball is right

1143
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,720
it's I I kind of see where you're saying

1144
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,240
though is that it's it's really there's

1145
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,280
a hard definition of here's the capacity

1146
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,500
available in this data center right in

1147
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,780
in wherever but at the end of the day

1148
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,319
the the footprint is really the based on

1149
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,000
the eyeball definition right and we're

1150
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,460
we're kind of mashing those two together

1151
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,319
and I can see where some of the

1152
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,319
confusion comes in

1153
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:30,059
yes so I think that kind of again this

1154
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:33,599
is for this um you know uh nascent uh

1155
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,700
name footprint discussion of that I

1156
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,440
think the realization would come to is

1157
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,480
that we really are using the eyeball

1158
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,020
definition cdni

1159
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,700
literature kind of actually not very

1160
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,160
definite on this until you come to some

1161
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,800
very obscure kind of draft really not

1162
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,420
even RFC that says well when we say

1163
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,800
footprint really mean two different

1164
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,140
things it's either set of caches defined

1165
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,740
by IP addresses or a set of users and I

1166
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,240
really saw that in all of our

1167
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,920
discussions that when footprints come up

1168
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,839
we really mean the eyeball so I'm just

1169
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,520
making sure that when you think about

1170
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,500
the capability here you're also thinking

1171
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,359
eyeball footprint and not cache

1172
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,220
footprint because to me the ladder

1173
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,700
really kind of meaningless uh kind of

1174
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,839
across the board

1175
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,119
so I'm just making sure that that we on

1176
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,280
the same page looks like we are

1177
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,940
cdni is always based off the user we've

1178
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,059
the the intent was never to

1179
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:28,440
um to try and describe the cash

1180
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,300
infrastructure because we don't want to

1181
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,960
expose any cdn's internal infrastructure

1182
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,339
they can serve however they want if they

1183
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:37,680
say they can serve in in London they can

1184
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,059
serve in London if they're serving it

1185
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,940
out of Japan to serve London that's you

1186
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,520
know not our problem I think um it's

1187
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,319
probably a bad idea but you know we

1188
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,500
don't want to take that into account so

1189
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,960
um we have always said that's kind of

1190
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,819
out of scope I don't I think it's

1191
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:55,319
written somewhere but I'd have to go and

1192
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:57,780
look but if it is Unwritten then you

1193
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,880
know we we are trying not we are trying

1194
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,280
to avoid exposing anything about the CD

1195
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,380
and physical infrastructure and focused

1196
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,559
on you know the end users what we

1197
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,700
believe is the end users location

1198
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,619
obviously tunneling and that sort of

1199
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:13,200
thing maybe I do believe that is

1200
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,540
specified in this draft as well as one

1201
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,640
we have to

1202
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,700
we can't advertise Carl Blanc all

1203
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,920
capacity we can just give you here's the

1204
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,200
capacity available for you Upstream CDN

1205
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,000
because of restrictions just like that

1206
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
we we don't want to allow for someone to

1207
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,859
reverse engineer like the actual

1208
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,800
capacity of a downstream CDN per se and

1209
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,319
then two we're not we're explicitly

1210
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,599
saying we cannot provide slas on service

1211
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,500
like this is a a guidance this isn't a

1212
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,660
hard rule or anything that you can

1213
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,760
associate an SLA with in terms of like

1214
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,579
you know penalties or reputation service

1215
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:52,380
or anything like that explicitly for

1216
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,079
that point right this is a best guess

1217
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:59,099
like and it's meant to help prevent you

1218
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:01,819
know over utilization of bottlenecks

1219
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:05,400
Uh Kevin I I fully agree I'm not sure

1220
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,040
that is universally done this way I

1221
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,140
think there's at least uh but again this

1222
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,819
is a different conversation I don't want

1223
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:15,960
to to uh kind of the grass but uh I'm

1224
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,280
not sure that Footprints are University

1225
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,140
and the students you know as being

1226
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,079
eyeballs uh but that's that's for

1227
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,400
another day

1228
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,440
mostly so but not not universally

1229
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,559
Chris

1230
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,000
it's just briefly you mentioned that

1231
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,240
this uh uh

1232
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,819
the way in which this is related to

1233
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:41,280
business Arrangements that uh entities

1234
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,440
might have with one another

1235
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,720
um and I think we have agreement that

1236
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,400
that's entirely out of scope

1237
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,900
um I hope

1238
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,619
um

1239
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:54,180
okay I see heads Notting good the uh the

1240
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,559
question of whether someone makes a

1241
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,260
business agreement that this will have

1242
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,540
some sort of penalties or enforcers that

1243
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,000
SLA related thing is an agreement

1244
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,280
someone could make completely outside of

1245
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,720
this

1246
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,020
um but it's not related to this

1247
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,740
100 correct yeah we like once again like

1248
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,200
we explicitly call out we are not

1249
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,859
addressing any component of SLA or

1250
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,500
reservation at all with it with this

1251
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,280
model this is really a model to signal

1252
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,280
a happy path that if we have a

1253
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,200
downstream CDN has a reasonable

1254
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,480
expectation if that if the Upstream

1255
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,700
delegates the traffic within the limits

1256
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,000
they are advertising

1257
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,579
performance would be acceptable

1258
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,319
um but there is no definition really of

1259
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:44,460
performance this is just a loose

1260
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,900
agreement of

1261
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,599
if you we feel confident we can

1262
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,839
accommodate traffic at this level in

1263
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,859
this area and that's it there's no it's

1264
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:58,319
explicitly called out there is no

1265
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,260
any further discuss relation at that

1266
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,240
point

1267
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,859
it's probably something that's going to

1268
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:06,720
come down the line though

1269
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,440
um

1270
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,240
but that's not something we're tackling

1271
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,020
at the moment here

1272
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,059
okay I think we have uh Anand in the

1273
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:21,839
queue now and Kevin Anand

1274
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,740
hey uh Anand from uh ago Limelight

1275
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,920
um the advertised capacity from the

1276
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,740
downstream CDN is that the Ingress

1277
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,380
capacity is advertising or is that the

1278
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,540
amount of egress it can support because

1279
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,339
the egress is a function of the request

1280
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:41,400
rate right like a 50 gig file

1281
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,859
the option seating doesn't really know

1282
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,960
what's going to amount to the egress

1283
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,119
capacity so what is the downstream CDM

1284
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,859
actually advertising here maybe I'm

1285
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:52,020
missing some context

1286
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,740
so the the in this model here what we're

1287
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,260
talking about here right is

1288
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,500
the amount of traffic the downstream CDN

1289
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,740
is willing to allow the Upstream CDN to

1290
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,720
delegate towards it right so in this

1291
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,400
case the eyeballs

1292
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,619
where previously they may have come to

1293
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,040
the Upstream CDN or like edio now let's

1294
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,140
just say that ego decides to delegate

1295
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,140
that traffic towards broad Peak

1296
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,640
um what we're talking with this

1297
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,200
advertisement would essentially be broad

1298
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Peak would be telling agio I've got 100

1299
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,780
gigabytes uh gigabits per second

1300
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,619
capacity on Orange in Italy or something

1301
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:34,500
like that you can delegate your tracking

1302
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,880
how much you're delegating over to us

1303
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,819
send up to 100 gigabits per second so

1304
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:41,220
that would be egress as measured from

1305
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,599
broad Peak

1306
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:45,300
I see okay and and that's done like uh

1307
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,280
the decision is done by the option CDN

1308
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,559
on a per request basis then

1309
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,119
correct because that's where the the

1310
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,099
that's where the initial component or

1311
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:55,980
potential component of the eyeball

1312
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,559
termination would initiate right it's if

1313
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,839
the Upstream CDs like we're dealing with

1314
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,480
hey I'm getting a request but I want to

1315
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,800
send this request somewhere else right

1316
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,500
where the Upstream is delegating that to

1317
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,059
the downstream okay and so

1318
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:13,980
does this include the amount of Ingress

1319
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,619
that the so that's not a concern for the

1320
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,839
Upstream serial then so the footprints

1321
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:21,059
doesn't include anything about the

1322
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,859
Ingress towards the downstream CDN

1323
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,960
um we're not we have not put Provisions

1324
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,460
into the capacity API to

1325
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,920
advertise any limit on Ingress that

1326
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,260
would be more of a function of

1327
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,859
the the cash fill Source or I.E the

1328
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:43,319
origin or something that would be that

1329
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,780
was that's outside of this scope that's

1330
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,299
not a that's not a limit that the

1331
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:50,880
downstream would really want to ever

1332
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,520
well would readily advertise unless for

1333
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,740
some odd reason we want to account for

1334
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,599
the fact that the downstream CDN only

1335
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,980
has

1336
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,920
you know a 10 gig Uplink out of the

1337
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,859
world or so like I don't know uh that

1338
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:06,299
isn't something we've considered in

1339
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:09,299
terms of signaling of the capacity we're

1340
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,460
mainly dealing with

1341
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,220
outward based on

1342
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,460
the relationship of the end user eyeball

1343
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,920
to the downstream CDN not necessarily

1344
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,880
from the downstream to any origin source

1345
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,200
okay they could be extended with an

1346
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,760
additional limit type if there was a use

1347
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,020
case for that though

1348
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,359
mm-hmm

1349
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:35,640
I just wanted to add that the uh that

1350
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,559
the Telemetry is there specifically

1351
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,020
because the Upstream doesn't necessarily

1352
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,720
have an exact understanding of the

1353
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,180
effects on egress from the delegated

1354
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,859
traffic

1355
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:48,059
um you know particularly something like

1356
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,500
video streaming where you're delegating

1357
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,059
a session and then all subsequent

1358
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:53,040
requests are going to the downstream the

1359
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,319
Upstream may not know exactly how much

1360
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:57,960
egress is consumed by those sessions so

1361
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,780
that's why uh this is explicitly

1362
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,540
associated with a Telemetry source so

1363
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,880
that the Upstream can monitor that and

1364
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,260
use that to inform its traffic

1365
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,359
delegation decisions

1366
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,559
foreign

1367
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,260
yeah sounds good thank you

1368
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,700
thank you I think we're a little bit on

1369
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,940
tight on the time so we're gonna move on

1370
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,920
um just before I close the queue on this

1371
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,000
any other questions

1372
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,200
just want to thank everyone for the the

1373
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,819
great feedback today it's been very

1374
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:29,040
productive thank you

1375
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,480
thank you

1376
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,780
so I think next we have near if you're

1377
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,440
still with us near

1378
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,880
yes I am

1379
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,540
all right

1380
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,099
Okay so

1381
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,200
hi everybody happy to be back here

1382
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:52,140
and we and let's say I would like to

1383
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,280
discuss the three years

1384
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,700
interface and the rewrite of the RFC we

1385
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:03,119
haven't made much progress in the last

1386
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,339
since the last meeting I was less

1387
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:08,599
available to pushing through but

1388
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,200
we hope to make a significant policy now

1389
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,819
and

1390
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:17,819
Sanjay and I'm working on that uh can

1391
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:21,380
you please I'll do

1392
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,400
do you want me to move through

1393
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,400
what is left slide or

1394
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,500
this is

1395
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,240
do you want me to move towards what is

1396
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,000
left to be done no no no

1397
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
let's stay like that

1398
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,420
um so a quick recap what is the cdni

1399
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,000
what is this in a

1400
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,940
Traders interface

1401
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:50,040
it's the interface particularly allows

1402
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,740
the absence then to control the down

1403
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,660
ccdn

1404
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,520
um

1405
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,839
to manage and control down seasonal

1406
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,680
content and metadata

1407
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,780
sorry

1408
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,780
um

1409
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:16,319
Friday afternoon and

1410
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:16,980
um

1411
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,500
do we haven't changed anything in that

1412
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,319
in this website in this purpose and

1413
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,799
perspective but we worked on the entire

1414
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:29,280
structure on the structures the 3D

1415
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,380
object next please

1416
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,059
so so far the radio the triggers object

1417
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:44,099
uh was built of a type a CDN path in the

1418
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,140
last draft we had

1419
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,920
uh we added in sometimes we saw the huge

1420
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,040
extensions OE and Sanjay mostly worked

1421
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:57,000
on that and then we had a a set of

1422
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,839
properties that the purpose was to

1423
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:02,819
specifies which objects the trigger

1424
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,500
should be applied on

1425
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,099
and one of the issues with this set is

1426
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,980
that every time you we would like to

1427
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,400
propose a new property is a new way to

1428
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,859
select content we would need actually a

1429
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,220
new version of it of the triggers

1430
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:24,059
uh so what we popularity practically did

1431
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:26,640
is pushing it to a generic list of

1432
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,339
trigger specs next weeks

1433
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:38,000
so the spec object practically specified

1434
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,920
when it comes to specify what to walk on

1435
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,940
what items to work on it it has a type

1436
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,119
that says okay it can be your aspect or

1437
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,559
a patent spec spec Etc how to select the

1438
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,520
content and it has also a subject are we

1439
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,980
working on metadata or content

1440
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:03,540
okay uh both of those lists are now uh

1441
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,720
flexible and Engineering we can register

1442
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,319
small types to work on

1443
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,160
next is

1444
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,280
and is here is an example for expect

1445
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,460
spec object in this case where the

1446
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,880
trigger the this spec objects points to

1447
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,760
a metadata

1448
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,680
with this URL

1449
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:33,079
okay so if we create a theory of a

1450
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:36,319
purge this method that the

1451
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,319
metadata residing in this URL would be

1452
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,740
purchased

1453
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:51,180
cool so another just a real name another

1454
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,359
change we did and is changing the

1455
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:56,819
Twitter type and the name trigger type

1456
01:04:56,819 --> 01:05:00,599
to an action which is I think what more

1457
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:03,059
were straightforward with to what it

1458
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:08,220
stands for so it's now called an action

1459
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,819
next

1460
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:14,700
so if we look at the entire figure and

1461
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,640
it's you in the trigger V2 in the new

1462
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,619
structure

1463
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:23,540
it has an action it has a list of specs

1464
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:27,059
that whatever element matches one of the

1465
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:30,480
specs would be the action would be

1466
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,839
applied on okay so in this case where we

1467
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,040
would work on a metadata with we will

1468
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,319
preposition the metadata with this URL

1469
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,380
and content

1470
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:46,940
uh with those two area

1471
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,799
um one thing we noticed is some kind of

1472
01:05:55,799 --> 01:06:00,240
some inconsistency in the structure of

1473
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,240
the uh it also already come for the

1474
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,599
original RFC in the structure of the the

1475
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:08,180
spec objects

1476
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:12,299
uh the aspects that like the URL specs

1477
01:06:12,299 --> 01:06:13,500
that um

1478
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,040
generally just strings URLs and there

1479
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,579
are more complex specs Like Ur patterns

1480
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:25,740
that are dictionaries that can uh with

1481
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,380
several fields and we can see an example

1482
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,099
in the next slide

1483
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,720
okay so this for example can be the list

1484
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,260
of specs in this in the trigger and the

1485
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,839
URLs are just a swing

1486
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:49,319
and your patterns are a a bit actually

1487
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:53,059
every element is a dictionary

1488
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:55,920
is not the only one that is only string

1489
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,799
there's also the ccid

1490
01:06:57,799 --> 01:07:03,079
and that is practically the same

1491
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,180
um next

1492
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,799
so

1493
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:11,160
what we would like to present to uh

1494
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,799
suggest and change is making for

1495
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:15,440
consistency and

1496
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,200
uh of the instruction for structural

1497
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,539
consistency

1498
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:24,599
we would like to consider to move

1499
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,760
a all objects also the URLs to a

1500
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,240
dictionaries style a list and to be

1501
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,039
honest only

1502
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,599
a

1503
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:40,380
an hour ago when I we first ago I went

1504
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,299
again over the presentation

1505
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:46,200
I started to think maybe they also they

1506
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,619
block before that is is not needed if

1507
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:52,500
can I pointed at the URLs and the

1508
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,700
patterns a token can be removed so just

1509
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:01,319
have a list of values of of dictionary

1510
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:04,380
similar to the footprint API and with

1511
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,039
what we have in the footprint API and

1512
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:10,260
I don't I'm not sure you are following

1513
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,180
what I'm saying here because it's not in

1514
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,760
the in terms of the presentation but

1515
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,939
uh I think it might be even

1516
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:18,660
um

1517
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,000
cleaner to do that

1518
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,198
and to remove the URLs and patterns to

1519
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,599
those tokens and just have the list

1520
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,520
um

1521
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,420
yes Alan

1522
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,279
does the dictionary mean that you can

1523
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:41,580
support multiple like free kind of Uh

1524
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,839
custom values in those or not

1525
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,299
the the structure of the of the

1526
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:52,319
dictionary is uh is well defined

1527
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,460
a pair a spec type

1528
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,339
and

1529
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:04,920
and that that it's not uh it's the fact

1530
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,080
that the perspective you can actually

1531
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,859
argue okay push the Specter itself into

1532
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:13,679
the dictionary but I think it would it

1533
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,439
would be less sick

1534
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:19,799
less comfortable here

1535
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:21,899
um my guess my question is maybe you

1536
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:23,640
address it later or the different spot

1537
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,620
is that uh we see a need for uh

1538
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:31,140
basically custom values for triggers

1539
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,319
custom attributes is it something that

1540
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,839
this will address or not

1541
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,319
and can you give an example it won't

1542
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,899
invest that but we can add an open list

1543
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:44,540
of something or

1544
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,899
if there is specific specs that needs

1545
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:52,500
this uh the flexible attribute list we

1546
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,780
can just add a dictionary within it

1547
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,900
additional within the dictionary but if

1548
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,199
you I would be glad to if you have a

1549
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,380
good an example for that

1550
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,040
um yeah so so for for in in kind of we

1551
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,500
were looking at the as part of the kind

1552
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,880
of content management cash management

1553
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,480
spec again at svta uh we're looking at

1554
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,719
various uh ad hoc uh or custom

1555
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,820
attributes that would be added for

1556
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,920
example bandwidth policies around

1557
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,840
prepositioning right

1558
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,000
right do preposition but do it only on

1559
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,520
Sundays per position but use no more

1560
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,219
than 100 gigabits or 100 megabits per

1561
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,699
position by then they do this by uh in

1562
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:38,040
seven days things like that and what

1563
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,800
kind of every other time that so so what

1564
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,840
I'm saying I guess triggers can be can

1565
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,060
become really hairy kind of they can be

1566
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,920
a lot of different attributes it would

1567
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,840
be good to have a mechanism to extend

1568
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,820
that without revising the whole spec

1569
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:54,600
every time it's uh I'm glad to use the

1570
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,940
term extend them because this is

1571
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,340
basically what the trading trigger

1572
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,179
extensions does and I haven't referred

1573
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:05,580
to that because it didn't want to

1574
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,239
overload the session but uh the first

1575
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:12,719
when we started to work on the on this

1576
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,940
on the LFC and we actually had the draft

1577
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,100
that we was a standalone draft with that

1578
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,100
adding the trigger extensions and that

1579
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,320
allows you to specify that you want want

1580
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,100
that we got to be called to run to be

1581
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,659
executed on a Friday night at 2 am only

1582
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:34,980
in Brazil

1583
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:39,239
okay and the extension is also generic

1584
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:41,400
and you can we can redefine more and

1585
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,920
more extension extensions this is part

1586
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,780
of it was integrated into this RFC and

1587
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:52,679
if you see you I would I would be glad

1588
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:55,080
if you will review that and if you had

1589
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,360
any additional idea for additional

1590
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,000
extensions let's add them let's already

1591
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,020
add them add them into this RFC

1592
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:08,760
and that would be valuable I you

1593
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,840
actually take into different directions

1594
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,520
than I was thinking I think I was

1595
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,400
thinking kind of I stand the attributes

1596
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,620
of this trigger which you you kind of

1597
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,060
you say hey we want to restructure the

1598
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,140
way we do this we wanted the

1599
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,900
dictionaries let's kind of Define

1600
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,100
trigger payload different kind of

1601
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,020
differently and I was thinking hey we

1602
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,199
want to provide a way to to uh easily

1603
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:31,679
add values to the triggers of specific

1604
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,719
types without you know changing respect

1605
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:35,400
but you're saying also something else

1606
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,520
that maybe that maybe I'll actually a

1607
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,520
whole different uh Dimension is how do

1608
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,440
you run triggers I want to run triggers

1609
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,940
repeatedly I want to run triggers a

1610
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,400
certain time which is not what what's in

1611
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,840
the trigger but how do you run that

1612
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,300
which I haven't seen that kind of so

1613
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,739
that's also interesting even though

1614
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:54,239
that's new to me

1615
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,880
yeah so this is also this is also the

1616
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,679
already in the draft it's a

1617
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:05,520
presented it is presented there and uh

1618
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,179
if we you see what the spec practically

1619
01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:14,159
needs to come to specify what to run so

1620
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,040
if you have and there are patterns and

1621
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,640
vertexes and what

1622
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:24,120
about eight types of specs if you think

1623
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:27,060
there is a need to an additional spec of

1624
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,580
one of those specs to be extended with

1625
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,040
an open list of properties or something

1626
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,760
like that we can and we can end that if

1627
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:43,140
if there is a specific example that that

1628
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,760
show the need for that

1629
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,500
how about we take this to the mailing

1630
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,719
list we are a time we've got a couple

1631
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,620
more um items to continue there yeah so

1632
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,219
what uh ahead of us and what's we first

1633
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,560
of all over I would like to make we

1634
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,739
would like to make the change of uh of

1635
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:04,140
the structure of the specs of the URL

1636
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:08,840
and the ccid and then

1637
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:14,420
as this as we took the original RFC and

1638
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:18,239
just everything to it we we need to

1639
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,219
with it we read it in the fresh mind and

1640
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:26,100
verify that everything is consistent and

1641
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,640
then we hope that by the next iitf

1642
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,040
meeting meeting we will be able to get

1643
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,920
for the working group let's go

1644
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,500
and by the way uh thank you Kevin for

1645
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:42,320
the shepherding in the footprint uh RC

1646
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,860
putting type of thing I'll see

1647
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,699
you're welcome

1648
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:49,500
um looking looking forward to reading

1649
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,179
the updated draft and I encourage

1650
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:52,560
everyone when they see it come out on

1651
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,480
the list to please review it there's a

1652
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,000
lot of good stuff in there and we want

1653
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,860
to try and get it right this time

1654
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,719
thank you

1655
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:06,360
thank you

1656
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,880
okay I think we have

1657
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,920
Chris you on the next here

1658
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,659
in today's episode of hot drafts from

1659
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:29,880
the uh CTA

1660
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,980
we have the streaming media tracing next

1661
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,020
slide

1662
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,420
uh talk about who they are uh if you're

1663
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,480
not familiar already and uh

1664
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,940
what we're working on and why you might

1665
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:45,080
care next slide

1666
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,440
so this is uh work being done out of the

1667
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,280
CTA the consumer technology Association

1668
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,440
their wave or web application video

1669
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,960
ecosystem the wave subgroup

1670
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,980
and the primary motivating uh use case

1671
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,560
for this is streaming media but as you

1672
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,159
will see uh it may find itself

1673
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,440
um more broadly useful or it may not

1674
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,980
depending is the work uh develops the

1675
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,260
ultimate goal of this particular group

1676
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:19,620
is interoperable tracing

1677
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:21,360
um specifically interoperable tracing

1678
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,760
for streaming media but it turns out

1679
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,679
that uh streaming media isn't that

1680
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,679
different when you just do it over HTTP

1681
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:30,600
so there may be some interesting uh

1682
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,159
utility next slide

1683
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,199
so uh

1684
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,719
right now we're near the very beginning

1685
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:41,880
of the process we've scoped out the work

1686
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,860
that we want to accomplish and we've

1687
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,179
determined that there are basically

1688
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:48,420
three big legs of this work

1689
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:51,179
there is the pole the push and the

1690
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:52,260
export

1691
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:56,159
so Paul is the

1692
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,820
um stage of a request

1693
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:01,800
client asks an intermediary like a CDN

1694
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,040
for Content intermediary asks an origin

1695
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,860
for Content each of the entities is

1696
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,560
attempting to pull content from the next

1697
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,940
up in the chain

1698
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,460
and we want to be able to trace this as

1699
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,000
we go through

1700
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,340
the second piece is

1701
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,920
um a little bit less well understood but

1702
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,719
the basic idea is that Origins don't get

1703
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,659
their content from nowhere

1704
01:17:26,659 --> 01:17:30,060
usually their content comes from some

1705
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,860
sort of a processor that may or

1706
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,440
transcoder something that that modified

1707
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,340
the data and that got it from some sort

1708
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,280
of a source very often if we're talking

1709
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,380
for example video content it may have

1710
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,640
come from a camera if we're talking

1711
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,520
about audio content a microphone

1712
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,159
um and we would really like a

1713
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:54,120
interoperable way to move this data

1714
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,120
around in a way that moves with the data

1715
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:02,420
as metadata on the uh on the envelopes

1716
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,219
and uh lets us measure latencies

1717
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:07,679
identify problems

1718
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,840
um this data is primarily forensic in

1719
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,000
nature and that brings us to the third

1720
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,699
leg which is the export

1721
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:18,300
um so we've moved this data around on

1722
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,179
the objects on the envelopes uh we

1723
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:23,280
probably want to send it to a logger

1724
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,380
somewhere right

1725
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:26,520
um

1726
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,400
we aren't quite sure what this is going

1727
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,020
to look like there's a solid chance it's

1728
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,560
going to look a lot open telemetry-ish

1729
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,780
but uh the work group hasn't actually

1730
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:39,480
started really digging into that so

1731
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,480
that's just a just a guess at this point

1732
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,440
next slide

1733
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,460
so right now we're at the beginning of

1734
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,860
the poll part of the stage

1735
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:52,140
um which means we're defining uh

1736
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,480
requests and response headers for HTTP

1737
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,460
in particular

1738
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,380
we have a request header that provides

1739
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,020
visibility into the request chain so

1740
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,640
that when An Origin receives a request

1741
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,580
it knows roughly speaking what route it

1742
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,020
took to get there

1743
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,420
we have a response field that provides

1744
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,880
visibility under the response chain when

1745
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,000
a client gets a response the client then

1746
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,500
knows uh uh what the entities

1747
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,540
responsible for preparing that response

1748
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:22,800
for it are

1749
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,500
uh they both use structured field values

1750
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,520
and they represent a graph of the trace

1751
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,219
and this graph concept turns out to be

1752
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:34,440
really important because all of the

1753
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,120
existing

1754
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,159
um processes

1755
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,659
um and and headers that we would talk

1756
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:43,080
about like this things like uh the cache

1757
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,460
status header and the proxy status

1758
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,820
header and the cmsdynamic header and the

1759
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,159
Via header even those are all the

1760
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,380
glutenative headers they just add up as

1761
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:55,380
you go and that's fantastic and it's

1762
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,980
valuable but it only captures the

1763
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,460
successful part of the trace it captures

1764
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:07,739
one linear uh representation of how the

1765
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:11,219
data got from origin to client or vice

1766
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:12,659
versa

1767
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:15,000
and so uh one of the things that we want

1768
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,640
to make sure that we support here in

1769
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,040
this particular work is we're trying to

1770
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,260
represent the graph of the trace which

1771
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:24,420
includes the unsuccessful flows next

1772
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,780
slide

1773
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:31,800
so the format that we have

1774
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,219
um and to be clear uh our group has not

1775
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:36,960
fully reached consensus this is in fact

1776
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,360
a work in progress

1777
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,520
um so this structure this uses

1778
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,699
structured headers and the field is a

1779
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:47,280
list of sub-lists

1780
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,000
um each element of the list is a server

1781
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,580
intermediary or client basically a

1782
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:57,360
participant in the HTTP flow

1783
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,699
um each element of the sub lists

1784
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:02,840
represents one of their requests which

1785
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:06,360
may or may not have been successful

1786
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,020
um

1787
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,440
a h an intermediary that simply attempts

1788
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,480
to make a request upline and never gets

1789
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,980
a response to the ACT

1790
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,020
uh that's useful information would like

1791
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,360
to be able to store it in the flow

1792
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,120
um and so uh just because there's a

1793
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,320
request doesn't mean there was a

1794
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,840
response for example

1795
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,040
um

1796
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,380
sub-list elements so these are the

1797
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,679
elements of the sub lists are relative

1798
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:33,960
indices that indicate the target of the

1799
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,100
request

1800
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:41,540
in this way we create a graph next slide

1801
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,239
I am not going to go into deep detail on

1802
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:49,500
this but this is what a full chain might

1803
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,300
look like if it were exported from a

1804
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,159
client

1805
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:53,780
um

1806
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,520
you kind of read it bottom to top the

1807
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,560
client is at the bottom you can see that

1808
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,020
it has one element of its sub list zero

1809
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,080
that says it made one request that

1810
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,800
request was to the thing directly above

1811
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,540
it

1812
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,199
um the in the the the element the item

1813
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,179
marked intermediary

1814
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:17,820
that has two elements in its sub list

1815
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,460
zero and one that tells you that in

1816
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,940
order it requested zero which is to say

1817
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:28,140
origin a and one origin B it didn't give

1818
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,760
us any information as to why it

1819
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,580
requested uh multiple things

1820
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:36,719
um or or why originate failed or any of

1821
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:37,739
that

1822
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:38,400
um

1823
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,900
but it tells us what the shape of things

1824
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,179
looks like and you can see if you were

1825
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:43,860
to draw that out in a graph what it

1826
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,659
might look like on the right

1827
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:48,179
next slide

1828
01:22:48,179 --> 01:22:50,460
you can add data to this

1829
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,739
lots of data

1830
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:54,900
uh we're not going to dig into this but

1831
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,460
you can see timestamps you can see

1832
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:58,400
durations

1833
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:04,199
you can see uh times to cancel you can

1834
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:05,699
see that some of the things might have

1835
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:07,260
been synthetic because I never reached

1836
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,560
them in the first place

1837
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:13,440
lots of good information and we're

1838
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,540
considering you know we're currently

1839
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,699
scoping out what all of the types of

1840
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:18,719
information we're going to store

1841
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:21,060
obviously timings and latencies are

1842
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,400
super valuable

1843
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,300
you can see times there we're aware that

1844
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:29,100
non-relative times are not super

1845
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,739
valuable there are some use cases where

1846
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:33,960
you need them though

1847
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,040
um

1848
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,880
next slide

1849
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:41,280
so we're still near the beginning of the

1850
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,199
poll stage uh we're working on the

1851
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,719
details of the data format

1852
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:48,420
um nothing is set in stone

1853
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,179
um I'm not even sure it's set in mud yet

1854
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:52,739
um we're starting with the timing data

1855
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:57,120
but we're expanding to store many more

1856
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,520
additional formats of data we are

1857
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,960
looking at the aforementioned

1858
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,500
glutenative headers uh to see what for

1859
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,080
what pieces of those data it is useful

1860
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,540
to

1861
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:12,360
define whether we can simply delegate to

1862
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,699
those headers and their formats and

1863
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:18,600
their uh their definitions because we'd

1864
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,460
like to not reinvent anything that

1865
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,739
doesn't require Reinventing and we'll be

1866
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:26,419
defining more as we go next slide

1867
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,980
why do you care

1868
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,659
uh why am I talking in front of this

1869
01:24:30,659 --> 01:24:31,679
room

1870
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:32,940
um there will be eventually

1871
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:36,540
configuration elements uh CB and I may

1872
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:38,699
find it useful to allow these elements

1873
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:42,420
to be configured it may not that will be

1874
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,420
something that uh will be useful to

1875
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,179
determine at some point in the future

1876
01:24:47,179 --> 01:24:51,420
uh this uh streaming media tracing will

1877
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,480
eventually offer export logging

1878
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,340
um these interfaces are likely to be of

1879
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,960
interest uh it's hard to tell what

1880
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,340
they're going to look like

1881
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,320
um they may fit in to see the uni shape

1882
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,600
logging things they may look open

1883
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,880
telemetry-ish

1884
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,800
um we're not sure but we want to make

1885
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,159
sure that uh you uh can be part of the

1886
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:12,780
conversation if you wish

1887
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,739
next slide

1888
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:18,860
questions

1889
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,699
I'm sorry we can't have questions

1890
01:25:23,699 --> 01:25:24,780
um we're gonna have to take it in the

1891
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,679
mailing list

1892
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,540
um I do want to give some time to to

1893
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,060
Alan as he had requested some time on

1894
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,280
the open mic to see what in a few

1895
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,139
minutes that he has thank you thank you

1896
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:42,179
thanks Andre uh so I share slides uh

1897
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:44,100
kind of kind of uh did you get that on

1898
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,060
Sanjay

1899
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:48,000
uh no but see if you can um I can

1900
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,100
probably ask us to share yeah a question

1901
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,380
I stopped sharing here

1902
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,280
asked

1903
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,620
um

1904
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:00,860
yeah

1905
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,960
yes uh right uh

1906
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,500
I don't know it's actually asking

1907
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,260
is choose deck to share it would be

1908
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:16,020
something that you share not something I

1909
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,219
can share

1910
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:21,800
okay uh share screen yes yes yes yes yes

1911
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,540
okay

1912
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:30,780
yes uh do you I really want to share my

1913
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,219
screen yes

1914
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:33,600
share

1915
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,659
um

1916
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,679
okay

1917
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,900
um it's kind of recursive and that's a

1918
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,280
topic

1919
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,679
um so very quickly

1920
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,420
um so this is work that uh was started

1921
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:51,300
by Guillaume and uh I was helping along

1922
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,420
to kind of to bring to fruition and uh

1923
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,000
that suspect that we kind of are working

1924
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,280
on a svta and there will be a draft

1925
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,800
we'll be submitting to the next ATF so I

1926
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,139
just wanted to look at a quick uh heads

1927
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:06,060
up on the work we're doing and that's

1928
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,100
coming up

1929
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:11,760
um a problem statement and uh why we are

1930
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,120
doing what we're trying to do is uh

1931
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,380
number of uh uh group members kind of

1932
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,360
came to to the front saying that kind of

1933
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,300
we need to include uh uh embrace our

1934
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,520
cursive request routing httpr and the

1935
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,199
open caching implementations and and

1936
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:30,480
there are a number of motivations

1937
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,380
um

1938
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,960
one is a latency reduction you can see

1939
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,880
on the right kind of schematic

1940
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,780
description of uh delegation today let's

1941
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,880
say a practical open caching

1942
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,340
implementations utilize iterative uh

1943
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,699
process which requires the user to go to

1944
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:50,520
ucdn and then you see the end in some

1945
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,380
shape or another depending on the method

1946
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:55,980
uh redirects the users to dcdn so uh by

1947
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:58,380
using recursive we seek to reduce

1948
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:01,100
latency so that we fewer

1949
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,880
round robin trips uh kind of uh

1950
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,980
rtt's kind of back and forth uh

1951
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:11,060
additionally the motivations are around

1952
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:14,760
ucdn wanting to retain control over what

1953
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,460
get delivered to the user in iterative

1954
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,520
approach uh the content gets served by

1955
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,580
the user by the dcdn and without any

1956
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,400
visibility and ucdm may Implement some

1957
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,080
logic that it wants to for example

1958
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,800
server side ad insertion where the they

1959
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,440
want to utilize some control over what

1960
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,780
gets delivered ultimately I want to

1961
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,699
consult the dams from CDN but want to be

1962
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:42,420
in control and last motivation is

1963
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,920
session by session the mission control

1964
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,520
where kind of ucdn dcdn wants to admit a

1965
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,980
session by session as opposed to kind of

1966
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:53,639
bulk uh uh about delegation that happens

1967
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:55,679
in the iterative approach so that's a

1968
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:56,960
motivation

1969
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,179
when we're looking at what's cdni

1970
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:03,840
specified until now it's RFC 7975

1971
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,920
and uh it Embraces both DNS recursive

1972
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,679
and HTTP recursive and the way it works

1973
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:14,520
a very high level is that uh uh UCD and

1974
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,300
dcdn exchange kind of uh Json encoded

1975
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,300
requests and responses uh over some

1976
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:23,880
control plane and

1977
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,920
um kind of it has several deficiencies

1978
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,679
so first of all that only uh delivers

1979
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,380
basic fields of the request in many

1980
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,420
cases we want to see all of the requests

1981
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:35,460
to make a decision

1982
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,440
uh they're really no latency reduction

1983
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,840
because uh kind of there's no ability

1984
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,199
for dcdn to deliver the response to be

1985
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,420
sent right away so usually that would

1986
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:49,320
mean dcdn tells you CDN oh go to this

1987
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,820
destination send the user to this

1988
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,679
destination so really no latency gain

1989
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,620
still has to be redirection

1990
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,060
um pretty complex to implement because

1991
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,580
that's you kind of really encoding uh

1992
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:03,000
requests over some custom protocol uh

1993
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,219
many situations not desirable so you

1994
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:06,960
just really want to forward request as

1995
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,820
opposed to pre-encoded in some kind of

1996
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,520
ad hoc format and it only delivers

1997
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,280
requests to the dcdn and as you will see

1998
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,760
next in some cases uh responses needed

1999
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,120
as well so out of this uh we're

2000
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,520
proposing a kind of updated request

2001
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,159
routing interface and these are the key

2002
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,500
features uh first of all we kind of

2003
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,440
common HTTP s based open caching

2004
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,679
interface uh it will uh provide backward

2005
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:38,699
compatibility for RFC 7975 uh flare of

2006
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:41,280
the this kind of Json messaging only is

2007
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,860
because we want to support dnsr and this

2008
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,980
is the way to do this kind of uh I don't

2009
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,480
know how much practical value there is

2010
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,100
but I think certainly we want to support

2011
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:55,020
both DNS and HTTP recursive uh the main

2012
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,540
difference or change is that as opposed

2013
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:01,380
to encoding requests and some format we

2014
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,480
want to actually forward you see in the

2015
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,300
dcdn exchange requests and responses as

2016
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:10,380
is so uh latency can be reduced so kind

2017
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:12,840
of request forwarded to dcdn dcn can

2018
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,540
respond and ucdm can send the request as

2019
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:18,000
is down to the user so we were gaining

2020
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,940
the latency and simplify implementation

2021
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,040
really something can be done in a kind

2022
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,980
of in a pretty standard kind of cache

2023
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,800
cache proxy chain mode as opposed to

2024
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,960
kind of creating some form of control

2025
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,080
plane protocol which is what RFC 7975

2026
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,980
proposes uh so ucdn may forward the dcdn

2027
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,900
response to the user without change

2028
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,639
because the implementation makes it

2029
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:43,520
easier and then straightforward

2030
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,260
uh we saw two different modes that are

2031
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:48,420
needed for operation kind of uh

2032
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:51,540
depending on how dcdn is provisioned and

2033
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,179
configured and then one is in request

2034
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:58,139
mode where a ucdn gets request from the

2035
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:02,340
user uh sends a request to to dcdn dcdnx

2036
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:05,639
on it and usually that will require dcdm

2037
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:07,739
to have independently configured to get

2038
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:09,659
content from somewhere from the origin

2039
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:12,960
from ucdn and so on and so on and there

2040
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,880
is kind of so there is a kind of a

2041
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,280
really a proxy chain that gets created

2042
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:21,480
in response mode a situation where dcn

2043
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,840
doesn't have independent uh uh access to

2044
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,400
the content uh or there is some custom

2045
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,860
logic that is is happening on your CDN

2046
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:35,340
so in this case ucdn will supply not

2047
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:38,219
just a request but also the response as

2048
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,500
ucdn would send it and then the CDN

2049
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:44,280
would act on that and the spec proposes

2050
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,900
kind of support for both and also

2051
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,639
Dynamic change from one another you can

2052
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:49,980
ask you can start by asking for for

2053
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:52,260
giving the request and this again say

2054
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,719
well hey yeah and I got it I don't have

2055
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,239
enough information please give me the

2056
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:58,860
response you would have given to the

2057
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:01,320
user so then I can tell you how to

2058
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,960
change that or or and or can I support

2059
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,260
that

2060
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,820
um not going into a lot of detail here

2061
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,560
take a lack of time or something I guess

2062
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,120
we'll we'll hopefully do the next next

2063
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,820
session but uh there is a detailed kind

2064
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:18,300
of diagram of the request mode uh kind

2065
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,020
of will support HTTP 302 redirection and

2066
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:25,440
manufactory right from the dcdm so ucdn

2067
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,580
can give the request to to uh the DCd

2068
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,920
and the dcdn can just respond yeah sure

2069
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,320
kind of get it here is a response please

2070
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,679
provide it for me or and uh including

2071
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,920
change uh of the content and can be 302

2072
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,500
it can be also error conditional like I

2073
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,239
I cannot support that sorry kind of

2074
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:46,860
that's not a session I can support but

2075
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,360
we talked about granular session control

2076
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:51,480
that would provide a way to do that and

2077
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:55,020
uh it can also provide dynamically say

2078
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,699
well get it but I don't have enough

2079
01:33:56,699 --> 01:33:58,560
information please give me the response

2080
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,659
as well which takes us over to the next

2081
01:34:00,659 --> 01:34:05,880
mode where a ucdm provides a response to

2082
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:09,239
dcdn and then dcdn makes a decision

2083
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:12,719
decision on any of the changes it wants

2084
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,060
to do let's say manifest rewrite or

2085
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:18,719
content compression or decisions for uh

2086
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,639
delegation redirection that are based on

2087
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:23,820
the response request not enough you can

2088
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,920
understand that what kind of size the

2089
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,260
objects are you know maybe mine type and

2090
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,560
you can decide whether you want to to

2091
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,940
redirect this content to dcdn or not

2092
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:38,340
uh so that's a high level right again we

2093
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,219
will bring you forward the the spec uh

2094
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:44,340
it's uh in final form now going to svta

2095
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:48,300
review as well and uh we'll welcome uh

2096
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,639
comments and now working with the group

2097
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:55,400
to to uh getting this into cd9

2098
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,659
thank you Alan

2099
01:34:59,699 --> 01:35:01,500
thanks Alan looking forward to seeing

2100
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,739
the draft

2101
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,060
okay

2102
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:07,739
um so I think we are a few minutes over

2103
01:35:07,739 --> 01:35:10,080
so I really appreciate everybody's time

2104
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,639

here um in the UK and late afternoon and

2106
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,800
I know it's early in the morning in um

2107
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,199
some of you are that are in the US

2108
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,120
and probably late in the day

2109
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,100
somewhere else that you're on the east

2110
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,980
side of the continent

2111
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:28,080
um but I really thank you everybody uh

2112
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,600
great session and um I I really

2113
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,699
encourage that those who could not ask

2114
01:35:32,699 --> 01:35:34,380
questions to go onto the mailing list

2115
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,440
and uh you know put your question in uh

2116
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,540
on any of the drafts that you heard or

2117
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:42,239
or presentation from Chris and from Alan

2118
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:45,179
so uh feel free to do that

2119
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:48,659
um and um Ellen uh if you I'll since you

2120
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:50,520
have sent me the email I will send that

2121
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,620
into the distro into the cdni mailing

2122
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,719
list so that folks can see what what

2123
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:57,120
you're proposing and um yes definitely
