1
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,840
we have to

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,980
stop working good

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,640
hello everyone we are going to start

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,400
um hello everyone welcome to join the

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,760
office area and upset WG meeting

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,039
please note this session is being

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,640

here are some resource for idea4115

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,560
and

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,799
let's go to the first session uh welcome

20
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,920
to the off sale working group it's

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,880
chaired by Kieran and Joe and Hank

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,180
and before we really start we need the

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,340
um

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,720
subscriber and the minutes taker

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,039
thank you very much okay we can start

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,840
and here is the working Google status

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,060
after iotf 114 the L2 LM model was

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,479
published as the RFC 9291 and

29
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,180
congratulations to the authors and the

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,920
contributors

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,000
and there are six drafts submitted to

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,500
isg for publication

33
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,739
um actually question two I think you Rob

34
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,280
on um I got pinged on the TLs TM the

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,020
SNMP

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,200
um transport model update I just assumed

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,720
that it's working through your queue

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
um for what will be sent upwards to the

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,260
isg

40
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,520
uh yes I think I I'm trying to think

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,860
where I am the docs I think I've

42
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,500
um currently reviewing the yes from axis

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,540
one I think so I think that one is next

44
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,340
on the list after that so

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,620
so it'd be after this it effort I get to

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,000
review it but hopefully it shouldn't be

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,260
that far

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,679
thanks

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,700
so there are um it's a small uh in

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,220
addition to the

51
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,900
drafts for Michael

52
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,540
uh who was asking for a working group

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,599
last call but we are missing some of the

54
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,080
uh first early previews there I think we

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,900
will go through them and then uh to uh

56
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
working Google that's called on the uh

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,900
liability in this and such uh later this

58
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,239
year but that's all

59
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,239
conditions

60
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,900
on other drafts so add encrypted DNS or

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,300
add encrypted DNS

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,120
um this is post uh technically I need to

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,220
close the last call on this there was

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,799
some additional uh an additional draft

65
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,760
of kind of Abyss to 4 4014 was added

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,860
here I was kind of hoping we'd get some

67
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,040
some more reviews of that but I'm going

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
to now talk to the DHC group because

69
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,920
they've been heavily involved in this to

70
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,080
see if they might want to Shep or

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,400
someone there might want to Shepherd

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,940
this but I think it's in a good place

73
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,680
right now unless someone wants to State

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,299
otherwise

75
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,480
foreign

76
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,300
agenda we have a very full agenda so

77
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,000
um the speakers please control your time

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,720
and we go the first one the model update

79
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,239
you can have slides

80
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,259
that's not the right slides

81
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,859
do you want me to do those ones

82
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,860
I propose that they're both being

83
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,520
uploaded

84
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,159
a new deck

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,860
I can just talk without slides they're

86
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,720
loading uh I have two documents on mud

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,919
one of them is mud acceptable urls

88
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,520
and the other one is about DNS

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,580
considerations for mud

90
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,740
um the acceptable URLs has been through

91
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,340
I think is pretty non-controversial it

92
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,520
updates RFC

93
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,560
8520 because it changes some of the

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
processing rules for

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,259
uh at least one of the the attributes in

96
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,539
the mud file

97
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,340
um and there's a nice slide that

98
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,560
explains it in one slide

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,199
um and the document is essentially it's

100
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
been around for more than a year

101
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,580
um it's had some various amounts of

102
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,160
review not a lot of deep review at this

103
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
point

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,580
um but as as far as I'm concerned is

105
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,280
ready for working group last call

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,699
the other document is

107
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,060
uh DNS considerations for mud

108
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,419
and that has had a couple of uh well at

109
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,759
least one fairly deep review from Ben

110
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,560
Schwartz

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,539
um and his opinion is that we're doing

112
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,160
it all wrong

113
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,759
um

114
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,780
and specifically we the internet

115
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,479
um and we should be using socks V5 so

116
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,600
that we can see uh so that firewalls can

117
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,780
see the DNS requests the the URLs

118
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,180
um with the DNS name in them and

119
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,280
therefore can apply

120
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,979
um name-based uh filtering and mud is

121
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,800
name-based filtering in the end

122
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,180
um so I think that's an interesting

123
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,100
suggestion I don't have the power to

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,800
make it so in this document

125
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,860
um it would revise 8520

126
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,740
um and well practically all the rfcs

127
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,300
that we've published in the past

128
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,620
10 years

129
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,740
so I don't think it's practical

130
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,160
um and given that I don't find it a very

131
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,620
useful thing to tell us

132
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,720
um so the biggest thing with the DNS

133
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,360
situation is that we basically have to

134
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,819
make sure that iot devices don't bypass

135
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,599
the local DNS uh it's okay if they use

136
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,160
Doh or dot or whatever doq as long as

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,099
they ask the same server that the mud

138
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,340
controller would ask

139
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,060
um in the very in the the degenerate

140
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,160
case of a home network with a single

141
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,620
router uh that means that that

142
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,259
essentially home devices should talk to

143
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,360
the home router to ask for DNS questions

144
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,240
they should not talk to

145
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,039
8844 or anything else and the home

146
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,039
router enforcing the mud should uh have

147
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,080
a cache of DNS requests and should do

148
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
that and that's really the advice it's

149
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,380
as simple as that

150
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,900
um use local DNS

151
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,819
that's about it and that that document

152
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,099
is has had much more review and much

153
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,680
more discussion and is also I think

154
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,680
ready for working group Law School

155
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,539
any questions sorry I'll just run away

156
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,919
and give you as much time as you like

157
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,280
Doc

158
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,660
no

159
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,240
anybody oh tears

160
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,719
hi Michael um I don't agree with Ben's

161
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,240
comment that if you have to install root

162
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,419
certificates on every iot device that's

163
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,000
gonna be quiet to intrusive I think DNS

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
filtering is the right way to do it and

165
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,100
we haven't figured out how to do root

166
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,260
search installation on home iot devices

167
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,380
so it's pretty easy for us to filter TNS

168
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,019
traffic and we are already working on

169
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,600
deploying uh encrypted DNS forwarders on

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,899
home routers yeah so with TNR and DDR

171
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,660
it's pretty easy for uh endpoints to

172
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,480
discover the encrypted DNS forwarders

173
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,519
and home routers right and home routers

174
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,740
can enforce filtering based on the mud

175
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,519
policy so it makes life lot easier and

176
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,459
uh I don't think the proxy approach is

177
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,860
Deployable at least in home routers

178
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,360
thanks

179
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,160
um and and I'll just say this there's

180
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,980
nothing against encrypted DNS it's just

181
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,220
it's that in right now encrypted DNS is

182
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,760
associated with off-site DNS and there's

183
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,500
no reason for that to be the case except

184
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,320
that that's how it's been deployed so go

185
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,839
do that from Firefox and chrome and

186
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,240
whatever to your heart's content but

187
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,339
don't don't have your iot devices do

188
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,420
that thanks

189
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,279
so um this is a comment from Hank as a

190
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,399
chair I was mentioning that one of the

191
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,440
map-based ideas that needed some a

192
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
little review of the DNS consideration

193
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,339
one definitely is not the one I think

194
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,260
that has passed actually a lot of

195
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,420
conversations such as timing thing a

196
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,640
little bit without any this sense we

197
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,160
could go into uh working last call for

198
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,019
that we acceptable ul's for the one

199
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,500
actually that I think is controversial

200
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,779
yeah but the

201
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:16,980
um

202
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,200
looking to get this one and then go from

203
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,380
there

204
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,000
okay let's go to the next

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,580
to ipfix related proposals

206
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,980
good morning everybody

207
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,399
next slide please

208
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:51,079
so regarding the srv6 SRH ipfix draft

209
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,760
received various comments from Spring

210
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,240
obviously WG and also

211
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,220
some of that natural candles which are

212
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,380
working on implementation

213
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,140
we addressed all open issued and also

214
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,920
verified with Ayana how to manage the

215
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,160
SRH Flex IPv6 and the SRH segment

216
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,100
endpoint Behavior registry the outcome

217
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,279
was instead of listing them directly

218
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,700
in the in the document we opted for

219
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,160
having a reference instead to the

220
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,760
segment routing registry

221
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,540
we expanded the terminology

222
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,360
section to have a Consolidated view on

223
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,779
on the terms which we inhibited

224
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,140
inherited from various rfcs

225
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,740
uh in the active segment IPv6 type we

226
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,560
added the the segment routing policy as

227
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,440
in yet as another protocol

228
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,019
and in the operational consideration

229
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,440
sections we're describing also now how

230
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
to deal with uh if you have more than

231
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,360
one segment routing header

232
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,500
we collected a template and in the

233
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,680
example section and added the

234
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,260
implementation status section where

235
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,660
we're describing uh

236
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,180
the two implementation one and open

237
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,040
source and the closed suit Source

238
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
implementation and also a data

239
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
collection implementation

240
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,820
sorry yeah okay got it sorry so and also

241
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,339
a data collection implementation where

242
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,560
we do the segment list section

243
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,180
decomposition

244
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,000
this vehicle you have on okay

245
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,620
okay

246
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,100
next slide please

247
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:48,180
so this is the open open source

248
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,579
implementation in VPP versus mentioning

249
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,300
too we did tested that in the ITF

250
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,240
hackathon uh last weekend

251
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,440
next slide please

252
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,060
uh so here just to give context so uh

253
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,139
the the SRH pad had a part that's the uh

254
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,720
on the on the picture the the Violet

255
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,500
part uh basically it complements uh the

256
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,600
so-called provider data playing part

257
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,000
where we can actually see to which PE

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,120
which we are forwarding and also the the

259
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,160
customer data playing part where we

260
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,399
actually see uh the the communication on

261
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,519
the customer side and here a note it's

262
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,220
important that the order matters since

263
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,519
we have two times IPv6 and this is

264
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,360
described in RFC 7011

265
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,420
next slide please

266
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,000
these are the fields which are in VPP

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,459
now exposed

268
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,220
next slide please

269
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,079
this is the

270
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,940
um laptopology we used for the

271
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,560
interoperability testing between Huawei

272
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,620
and Cisco where we have two Cisco PE

273
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,399
devices and six Huawei Huawei pmpe

274
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,980
devices and with it in probability

275
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,839
testing

276
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,480
next slide please

277
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,079
these are the fields we are exposing uh

278
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,100
in Huawei and they are according to the

279
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,079
a12 template record described in the

280
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,319
document

281
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,880
next slide please

282
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,700
and here an example query then uh with

283
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,980
the exposed data so we can actually now

284
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,160
uh select the the traffic engineer

285
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,519
passed in the segment list section we

286
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
can see or a bit on basically thanks to

287
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
the segments left basically the order of

288
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,480
the forwarding throughout the core and

289
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,940
we can see on each segment left on

290
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,060
basically uh which was the active

291
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,779
segment we are forwarding next to

292
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,320
next slide please

293
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,920
so uh the the open source running code

294
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,199
has been published on GitHub the first

295
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,000
commercial commercial implementation

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,680
will be in q1 and Q3 2023 and we are

297
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,959
asking the working group whatever they

298
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,120
believe the document is in stable state

299
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,100
so that we can request the early code

300
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,880
pointer location

301
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,800
that repeat

302
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,199
exercise

303
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,260
are you still any comments

304
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,440
yeah specifically um Thomas you and I we

305
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,940
emailed back and forth on that last

306
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,260
Point

307
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,180
um how many people have read this

308
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,339
document I guess I could do a poll that

309
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,639
show of hands were a few

310
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,639
um it would be good to get I'll ask this

311
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,680
question officially on the list because

312
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,380
I I do want to follow up you you've done

313
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,560
the implementation here in the hackathon

314
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,079
um but we need some feedback from the

315
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,579
working group as to whether or not they

316
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,040
believed it's stable and then we can go

317
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,500
to the the 80s and and see if we can

318
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,540
request that code point for you so we'll

319
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,440
do that in short order after after 1 15.

320
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,480
sure perfect thanks

321
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,480
quinoa

322
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,079
class so I think the Ayanna is one thing

323
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,600
right by the way we validate it with

324
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,760
Ayana that they're fine with uh the

325
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,740
latest version which actually Four

326
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,639
and actually this the trees Mansion uh

327
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,699
by Thomas so from a process point of

328
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,320
view I'm not sure what else we could be

329
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,160
doing to interrupt feedback from Ayana

330
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,459
Etc so Ayana earlier occasion is one

331
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,740
thing but uh you know you can ask a

332
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,839
question because it could go to last

333
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,360
call directly uh you know we got

334
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,680
feedback from the spring looking group

335
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,300
from everybody I'm not sure what else

336
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,079
you could be doing yep and and we can we

337
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,000
we can put it up for uh last call as

338
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,119
well

339
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,260
thank you

340
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,660
then on the second top uh draft

341
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,699
regarding the own past delay measurement

342
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,919
in ipfix

343
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,859
next slide please

344
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,679
here just as a smaller refresher uh

345
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,860
ipfix currently is lacking the ability

346
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,539
to export uh on path delay measured

347
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,220
metrics

348
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,679
next slide please

349
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,679
and here uh just to highlight the

350
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,020
importance that not only we need to

351
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,840
export the the delay Matrix itself we

352
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,000
also need to give those delay delay

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,480
Matrix context we need to understand

354
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,600
uh over which interfaces and nodes and

355
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,660
also which forwarding paths next stops

356
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,320
and so on were being used uh that gives

357
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,140
us context in terms of delay

358
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,299
next slide please

359
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,240
so the current status uh we received

360
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,080
feedback in ITF 114 regarding the the

361
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
terminology inbound versus on-pass

362
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,820
Telemetry so we adjusted that in the

363
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,400
draft

364
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,880
and also we received from tianagan uh

365
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,400
some feedback up regarding the

366
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,940
terminology using iom transient

367
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,700
encapsulation node versus Transit and

368
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,960
encapsulation node

369
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,960
next slide please

370
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,760
uh do you still recognize the problem

371
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,160
statement uh

372
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,620
we are uh want to measure a network

373
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,980
operator want to delay measure delays

374
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,320
uh we want to do that at the highest

375
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,539
scale for to get a statistical Network

376
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,799
delay view uh the I ipfix entries

377
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,260
defined in the document of independent

378
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,539
how the delay is being method in the

379
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:07,440
network

380
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,140
and currently we have two vendors which

381
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,059
are validating technical feasibilities

382
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,880
also showing interest and that the next

383
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,539
ITF hackathon we will show also an

384
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:22,679
implementation in fdio VPP

385
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,380
that's all on that document

386
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,720
any questions remarks comments

387
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,860
how many people have read in the room

388
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,140
how many people read this one

389
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,100
oh well pretty much a good set

390
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,220
um so we will uh conduct the call for

391
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,200
adoption formally

392
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,179
um I'll add that to the action item list

393
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,760
after 1 15. we'll see what the working

394
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,919
group feels on the list thanks excellent

395
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,820
thank you very much

396
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,559
foreign

397
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,580
yeah so the the main issue here is that

398
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,280
the um the ipfix registry is pointing to

399
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,799
you to um

400
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,799
um an old RFC which is which is defined

401
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,320
the um bitsy bits

402
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,940
um that was already I would say

403
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,220
duplicated by by the ATF in other recent

404
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,559
RFC so there's a deviation from the

405
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,539
current ipfix registry versus the one

406
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,820
which is mentioned in my TCP so this is

407
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,960
something which is really I would say

408
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,700
problematic from the interoperability

409
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,740
and the other issue we have with that

410
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,140
RFC is that the current word you know

411
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,000
for in the draft about some of the

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,220
result which is that the it is it is a

413
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,980
little bit weak and this is really uh

414
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,020
problematic in case we we have for

415
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,059
example for the the attack that are

416
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,100
using some of the flag Bits And if you

417
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,200
don't export what you are observing

418
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,960
there is a problem in analyzing the the

419
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,000
issues on the controller side next slide

420
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,380
please

421
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,419
so the fixes the fixes are really

422
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,100
straightforward to remove the any

423
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,559
mention of the rfcs when we we are

424
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,600
defining the the distribute control bits

425
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,580
just point to the iterative

426
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,179
um registry for the TCP and then we are

427
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,679
done so we simplify the way we are

428
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,200
maintaining the ipvx themselves and the

429
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,419
other one is that for the um the

430
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,120
behavior of the reserve which is that we

431
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,280
just we match the exporter must export

432
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,919
what is it is it is it is observing and

433
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
then apps to the um to TD

434
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,740
when we analyze data to uh to interpret

435
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,100
it entreparately next slide please

436
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
the next question is why we need NFC for

437
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,200
this um especially given that the ipfix

438
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,419
registry is um expert review we can just

439
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,039
go to the expert and say yeah please

440
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,960
modify the research three and then we

441
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,539
are done the problem is that in the rrc

442
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,480
that rrc in this slide we need an ATF

443
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,159
consensus for this so that's why we need

444
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,380
again to go for another RFC if we want

445
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,200
to fix what we have in the ipfx registry

446
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,640
hence the next slide

447
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,539
image I have I would say many questions

448
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,159
for the year for the working group the

449
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,539
first one is whether this is something

450
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,159
that you think that we should we should

451
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,020
we should solve that or we just forget

452
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,820
about it and leave people live with the

453
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,220
uh the entire property problems and then

454
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,200
if we decide to proceed with this we

455
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,919
have

456
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,260
some logistical aspects the first one is

457
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,000
in which stream the previous one I

458
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,799
remember it was sponsored by benue at

459
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,840
the time and I don't know if we will

460
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,900
consider that that that that that track

461
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,539
this this time but my favorite option is

462
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,580
to uh to adopt it here in the uh Ops are

463
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,020
working group rather than going for the

464
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,600
uh uh it is possible especially that we

465
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,580
have already working on the other ipvx

466
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,900
documents here in the UPS are working so

467
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,220
that's that will be just a

468
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,440
straightforward uh the other one which

469
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,120
track whether we maintain it in the

470
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,860
informational or go to the standard

471
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,799
track and so let's open the the third

472
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,320
one either we just maintain the current

473
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,120
approach we have in the drafts as to the

474
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,100
all that the new or we go to a clean

475
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,559
version with an abyss version of the uh

476
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,840
of the RFC especially the Earth is

477
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,960
really a very brief one so it it may

478
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,299
make sense to go with with the base

479
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,640
and that's it for what I have to tell

480
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,039
about this this restaurant

481
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,740
so I um

482
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,860
I I launched a a poll to get everyone's

483
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,020
interest if this there's three options

484
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,700
here you raise hand if you think this is

485
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,159
a problem to be worked on uh

486
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,960
specifically here

487
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,580
um don't raise your hand if you don't

488
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,620
have an opinion or do not raise hand if

489
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,780
you think no this is not a problem to be

490
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,940
worked on there's no interest or choose

491
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,980
to do nothing if you don't have an

492
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,260
opinion

493
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,900
as a chair I would personally and and I

494
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,000
know the ads and I have gone back and

495
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,220
forth on this I would prefer to have

496
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,260
things go through working group

497
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,440
um consensus and working group process

498
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,720
um so I I would like to see if there is

499
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,520
if the working group wants to take this

500
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,100
on I'd like to see it come or give the

501
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,900
work group first writer refusal and it

502
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,659
looks like what you can see here there

503
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,240
is some interest in working on this in

504
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,620
Ops AWG

505
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,020
and why

506
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,600
but one class so

507
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,900
you're right that first of all an ip6

508
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,679
meeting process must report what he sees

509
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,080
regardless of what we say in Ayana the

510
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,900
TCP Flags is a good example yes it

511
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,280
should be updated

512
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,580
now there is another option because

513
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,799
actually when I reviewed what's

514
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,760
happening in the is Ayana registry we

515
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,220
might have more occurrences than CP the

516
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,020
TCP Flags where we were too strict in a

517
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,000
description about reports at that time

518
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,740
of creating those information elements

519
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,380
they've been evolving so sometimes they

520
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,880
point to the right registry description

521
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,960
is wrong

522
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,200
so if we want to do a real good job we

523
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,580
should be reviewing

524
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,340
all the descriptions there and making

525
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,600
sure they're pointing to the right

526
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,700
registry so it might not be just

527
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,340
updating the TCP flux RFC it might be

528
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,440
okay if we want to solve this issue and

529
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,760
that's why I wanted to ask this question

530
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,299
before you did the poll uh Joe because

531
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,600
actually reviewing this registry for all

532
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520
the type of occurrences that you've got

533
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
might be a good

534
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,179
work to do but to just

535
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,380
sorry hard to take notes and comment um

536
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,500
that's uh it's

537
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,299
it's a good question

538
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,120
um and probably yes something that needs

539
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,700
review I don't know however Med if

540
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,640
that's the work you want to to take on

541
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,539
as part of of this work though yeah and

542
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,120
perhaps that's something that and I

543
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,919
don't know it could be that that's

544
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,260
something that requires a set of drafts

545
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,020
to go after each different area or if

546
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,460
it's something that someone wants to

547
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,380
take on and one Fell Swoop

548
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,240
problem uh so just confirm we said

549
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,799
earlier I have a strong preference just

550
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,940
trying to get this sort of work to go

551
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,440
through the working group

552
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,059
um and that's just because of my

553
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,100
workload if you go through ad sponsored

554
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,779
you a you get less consensus and less

555
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,940
sort of review and also it slows it down

556
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,559
because because of actually how much

557
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,659
other work I have to do so trying to get

558
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:55,500
this through the working group is

559
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,820
definitely best from my point of view

560
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,400
um because the I guess those were both

561
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,460
Benoit um so it sounds like there is

562
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,340
interest in in working on this

563
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,120
um I will or we will uh take this to the

564
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,480
list and see um about adoption but to

565
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,220
benoit's point this is something we'll

566
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,860
have to talk about do we

567
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,380
and and get what the working group feels

568
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,880
is this something that we need to do

569
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,679
more broadly

570
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,500
um and how should we approach that uh

571
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,779
for right now I think

572
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,380
um

573
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,100
we'll we'll look at this uh look at this

574
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,799
work uh this particular draft but if

575
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,679
there's a desire and maybe Benoit has

576
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,020
that desire we can we can push forward

577
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,480
with a broader uh look at the registries

578
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,760
speaking so Matt why don't you spend the

579
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,919
two of us half an hour to quickly go

580
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,080
through the Ayana registry and see how

581
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,600
big of a problem it is if it's only a

582
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,080
couple of if it's only TCP good if there

583
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,299
are some more if there are three we

584
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,059
could do it if we speak about 25 that's

585
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,159
a bigger job yeah okay yeah we do this

586
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,340
this week yeah we do that yeah okay

587
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,240
thanks Manuel

588
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,020
next

589
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,360
hello good morning everyone I'm thiru

590
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,179
I'm co-author of this craft

591
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:56,100
next slide please

592
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,880
uh what triggered this draft was uh

593
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,140
comments raised during the Isaac review

594
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,960
uh when we were publishing uh encrypted

595
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,080
DNS results discovery that was uh uh

596
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,779
work from at the working group at that

597
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,880
time there were various concerns raised

598
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,220
with regard to discovering encrypted

599
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,860
resolvers when uh endpoints end up

600
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,440
attaching to networks which which may

601
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,899
not be the legitimate Network that the

602
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,840
end user believes it is attaching to

603
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,000
these networks and that's a typical

604
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,940
problem today with regard to dotted next

605
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,860
not widely being deployed in several

606
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,200
networks endpoints not supporting the

607
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,380
iot devices not supporting rotten X evil

608
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,659
twin is a very uh common attack that's

609
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,620
seen in various networks uh because they

610
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,779
they all use pre-shared keys and there

611
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,640
are various ways pre-shade Keys could be

612
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,279
leaked to an attacker it could happen in

613
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,440
your home networks hotels coffee shops

614
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,659
even small office and home office

615
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,860
Networks foreign

616
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,539
that was happening in ad working group

617
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,539
was uh earlier there were several uh

618
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,299
endpoints which were using uh trusted

619
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,880
pre-configured resolvers like cloudflare

620
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,520
or Google and with this the the

621
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
challenge or the security risk that was

622
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,260
seeing was uh endpoints uh end up

623
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,500
connecting to uh attackers Network

624
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
emulating legitimate networks and they

625
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,600
would continue to use encrypted DNS but

626
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,220
the attacker who's hosting these

627
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,559
networks would be able to see uh even

628
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,440
modified DNS messages so the purpose

629
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,179
would be lost that was the concern that

630
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,100
was raised

631
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,178
next slide please

632
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,440
yeah and this is the same problem in any

633
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,659
network that use operationistic wireless

634
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,020
encryption where there is no no peer

635
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,940
authentication happening uh it could

636
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,919
also happen in mobile networks where

637
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,419
you're as part of the supply chain

638
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,880
attack uh there is a possibility that

639
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,580
the the long-term uh secret that's

640
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,279
stored on the SIM card is stolen and uh

641
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,140
you could be connecting to a fake based

642
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,120
Edition and the fake base station could

643
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,659
be hosting an encrypted DNS resolver

644
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,880
next slide

645
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,980
uh what did we do to solve the problem

646
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,799
right uh we proposed a mechanism where

647
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,080
we would use the discovered encrypted

648
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,679
resolver as a fingerprint uh to decide

649
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,600
whether you're indeed attaching to the

650
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,659
same network or not uh because uh these

651
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,960
uh servers are resolvers are get PK

652
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
validated certificates and that gives us

653
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,760
uh that means to say that the domain

654
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,460
name that these resolvers are using acts

655
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,559
as a fingerprint to identify if you are

656
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,659
indeed data setting so the same ssidy or

657
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,659
not but then if you are if you really

658
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,659
don't want to rely on SSID because

659
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:51,240
networks keep changing SSID there are if

660
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,799
there are networks which are using Heap

661
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,080
TLS don't have to rely on Trust on first

662
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,120
use mechanisms

663
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,959
next slide

664
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,000
so if you take scenarios like home

665
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,399
network which is using probably WPA2 or

666
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,520
wpa3 which is using psks and they don't

667
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,220
want to migrate to epls then this is one

668
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,919
proposal that you have is used Trust on

669
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,960
first use so the endpoint when it

670
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,340
connects to the network for the first

671
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,559
time fingerprints the network basically

672
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,100
takes the SSID hash of the preset secret

673
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,820
to make sure the SSID is unique because

674
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,080
there is a possibility that multiple

675
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,179
home networks would have the same SSID

676
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,880
then use the discovery mechanism that's

677
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,640
being used either DNR or DDR and the

678
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,679
identity of the encrypted DNS resolver

679
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,980
which would be domain name in case of

680
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,500
DNR and if it's case of TDR it's going

681
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,140
to be a public IP address uh which is

682
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,940
which will be there in the certificate

683
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,980
for the end point to validate

684
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,820
next slide

685
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,179
yeah so once the client disconnects and

686
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,799
reconnects to the network all that the

687
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,360
client has to do is recheck if the

688
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,100
encrypted DNS server side entity

689
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,840
continues to match if it doesn't match

690
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,120
it gives a hint back to the client that

691
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,340
it's most likely connecting to and he

692
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,120
will twins Network

693
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,080
there is a possibility that in certain

694
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,840
networks the SSID name would match the

695
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,500
DNS servers subject alt name extraction

696
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,320
uh so with that what would happen is for

697
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,880
example in case of a public Wi-Fi

698
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,039
hotspots you would have the SSID name

699
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,019
matching what is what is the identity of

700
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:34,019
the DNS server and and that Awards you

701
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,419
to avoids the endpoints to do uh tofu

702
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,700
mechanism but that may not be viable

703
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,039
options for several reasons for instance

704
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,320
my home network using a public resolver

705
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,539
and I can change my home network ssidy

706
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,700
for that to use the public resolver as a

707
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,440
society app name right so that doesn't

708
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,140
make sense in in several other networks

709
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,500
as well next slide

710
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,460
thank you

711
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,980
yeah what's the other alternative if if

712
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,740
you don't have to depend on uh tofu or

713
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,600
depend or get dependent onto the

714
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,940
encrypted universities uh if you're

715
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,280
using an e method for authentication

716
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,699
especially epls uh that's that's going

717
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,440
to be a lot more easier that all that

718
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,879
the client has to do is check if the

719
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,020
SSID name matches the uh sand extension

720
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,300
in the TLs certificate this is going to

721
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,399
be pretty useful for endpoints which are

722
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,399
not managed by MDM networks where client

723
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,440
authentication is not required and

724
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,099
during the device registration process

725
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,800
thank you

726
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,020
the security threats that we anticipated

727
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,020
was hey yes the evil twin will not be

728
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,599
able to see the DNS messages but it will

729
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,099
still be able to see the other traffic

730
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,219
uh but we see that the capability of the

731
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,800
attacker will will continue to decrease

732
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,139
as more and more protocols adapt to use

733
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,239
encryption for instance uh the work

734
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,820
happening in TLS 1.300 encrypted client

735
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,160
hello so the attacker will not be able

736
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,099
to see the Sni and they will not be able

737
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,920
to remove the DNS records with PCH keys

738
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,980
and that will also give protection from

739
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,200
pervasive monitoring not to identify

740
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,880
what Target domain the client is

741
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,980
reaching by just looking at the TLs

742
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,140
traffic

743
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,960
excellent yeah we would like to have

744
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,300
more discussion on this and any other

745
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,060
mechanisms that would help uh to protect

746
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,220
endpoints from connecting to these evil

747
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,899
twin Networks thank you

748
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,060
comments

749
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,859
Warren I figured you might want to

750
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:37,640
comment on this one

751
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,660
oh

752
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,200
apparently I'm really short

753
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,320
um so I don't know if you saw the ietf

754
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,160
welcome to the meeting message but the

755
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,480
whole thing on you might need to forget

756
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,700
your ietf SSID

757
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,280
and that's because we're using dot 1X

758
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,839
and it had like cached the certificate

759
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,760
and getting the phone to forget that was

760
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
really hard blah blah blah blah I do

761
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,079
think we need to be careful that if

762
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,540
people do things like this when their

763
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,520
DNS servers change

764
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,859
that's easy for them to tell their

765
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,839
device yes this is expected to be

766
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,000
different and yes I know like the

767
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,920
encrypted DNA stuff is all different

768
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,079
and sort of that's okay

769
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,119
especially if the device is doing stuff

770
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,160
like V6 multi-homing you might be using

771
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,140
one set of ISP at one point and another

772
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,780
one it might automatically change so as

773
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,880
long as it's easy that

774
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,119
the user has a way you know they don't

775
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,640
get stuck locked into an encrypted DNS

776
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,140
server that's no longer the one that

777
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,480
they want to be handing out

778
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,500
that's a good point thanks

779
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,680
okay next the one

780
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,900
okay so on behalf of uh Diego and nacho

781
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,300
from telefonica from Thomas from suscom

782
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,160
Jean and myself from Huawei I want to

783
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,020
present the data manifest for

784
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,540
contextualized Telemetry data

785
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,280
next slide please

786
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,680
so that's something that's a documentary

787
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,780
presenting a couple of times and I want

788
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,460
to stress something not sure if you've

789
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,460
witnessed this but uh there were

790
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,560
multiple background there were multiple

791
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,940
meetings

792
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,160
and discussions about trying to keep the

793
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,260
semantic in the ITF

794
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,020
so specific Nita collection so we had a

795
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,420
side meeting on getting Yang and sibo

796
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,220
Kafka

797
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,980
um in order to do yank push on boarding

798
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,700
there was also a net conf a draft on

799
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,380
getting the

800
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,880
the Yang module Revision in the header

801
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,800
in order to keep the the semantic along

802
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,320
the Palms it was presented also this

803
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,740
young and civil in iapg and Nigel who I

804
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,619
saw earlier presented like the limits of

805
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,520
modeling and we start to realize that we

806
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,680
need to keep the cementing absolutely

807
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,619
not only in configuration but also in

808
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,900
the operational part and this is all the

809
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,720
topics that were discussed recently

810
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,000
because the data without clear semantic

811
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,460
not only a repeating conflict but also

812
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,859
an operational is not useful we are

813
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:43,020
blind we cannot take an action for close

814
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,700
to action so the end goal is to analyze

815
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,579
the data from a data collection system

816
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:53,040
with the proper context the proper

817
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,680
semantic

818
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,839
why remember to do annual detection and

819
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,119
closed loop

820
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,339
what we're doing with this draft is not

821
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,119
to create new information it seems

822
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,339
simply to collect information we need to

823
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:11,520
determine the semantic and send it along

824
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,180
with the Yang push the telemetry

825
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,700
and even if the source not accessible

826
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,579
because yes information is somewhere but

827
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,460
just doing a call on the router to

828
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,020
understand this maybe it's not the right

829
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,119
thing or maybe because the router was

830
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,040
upgraded or maybe because the Telemetry

831
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,980
information was changed

832
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,099
so we need this information

833
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,940
next slide please

834
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,720
if you know about this slide about this

835
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,820
draft the example I always give is the

836
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,920
same let's Assume My Time series

837
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,320
database looking at time series and I've

838
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,800
got one counter yesterday at time T1 and

839
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,440
I've got nothing else since yesterday so

840
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,300
what's happening here

841
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,359
is there something abnormal well the

842
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,160
first thing you could be thinking if no

843
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,619
Telemetry data there is a Telemetry

844
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,119
issue

845
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,760
or maybe the revolter is overloaded and

846
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,540
can't send information maybe it's a bug

847
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,540
or maybe well there's no problem because

848
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,760
you ask this information to be sent

849
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,500
every single day

850
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,619
right or maybe you ask to do it on

851
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,320
change so if the value 42 in Time series

852
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,560
is still 42 Naruto right now well you

853
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,900
don't send anything which is same thing

854
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,359
as the suppress you don't see there so

855
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,260
depending on the context you have or you

856
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,839
don't have a problem to act upon

857
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,579
and this is the thing whenever we go

858
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:45,000
from the router to The Collector to uh

859
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,520
Kafka to a Time series to the analytics

860
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,619
and those guys now it takes their

861
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,780
relation tests I need to find an action

862
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,300
there so we they can't go and call

863
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,920
someone to say how did you configure

864
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,900
this Telemetry because I only see a

865
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,180
single value yesterday this is what you

866
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,799
want to solve next slide please

867
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,240
so the proposal is to have two data

868
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,880
manifests once the platform all the

869
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,339
information required to completely

870
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,980
characterize the platform information

871
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,520
which platform it is what is the OS you

872
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,060
have a specific license on this etc etc

873
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,460
because if it changes well the context

874
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,980
changes and the close to action will be

875
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,800
different and the other one is the data

876
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,700
collection manifest how was the

877
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,440
metering process how was the Telemetry

878
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,660
configured on the device is what the

879
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,280
previous slide I showed right with a

880
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,680
couple of different actions depending on

881
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,500
on the context and

882
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,099
this information must be streamed along

883
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:51,540
with the source

884
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,640
it does not mean that we have to set

885
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,160
every single time we send a Telemetry

886
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,380
message but it means that we must be

887
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,200
able to find back the information so if

888
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,900
the data is pushed different place

889
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,579
the context must be following

890
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,560
all right next slide please

891
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,540
so what is doing in this draft and by

892
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,339
the way uh if you want to get a details

893
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,040
there's backup slides so we changed uh

894
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,560
it was a proposal to change the Yang

895
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,680
module names to be more obvious okay

896
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,200
done the prefixes aren't changed

897
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,540
next please

898
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,760
what is new I would say is that to make

899
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,859
sure that we understand each other we

900
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:38,280
have a scenario in the appendix so

901
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,160
typically you've got a device sending to

902
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,680
a model vent Telemetry collector sent

903
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,140
into infix DB so what you could be doing

904
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,599
is at the top right hand side this is

905
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,400
typically what you would be having as a

906
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,040
Time series in inflex okay without a

907
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,780
timestamp because it's not useful to

908
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,160
replant them here

909
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,500
and with the Manifest we have actually

910
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,240
two different pointers

911
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,359
that are going into first of all the

912
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,700
platform manifest on the left and then

913
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,760
on the right we have the subscription ID

914
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,859
and the specific parts that we're

915
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,540
looking at and they're going and

916
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,540
pointing to the data collection manifest

917
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,280
so these are possible ways of storing

918
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,380
information in fixed DB and we thought

919
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,660
that giving a full example would help

920
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,760
understanding what you want to do

921
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,540
next slide please

922
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,339
so I have to admit that we have not

923
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,460
updated the draft as much as we wanted

924
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,140
so we still have some identified

925
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,040
Improvement that we want to do uh one is

926
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,960
to use the pen the private Enterprise

927
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,660
number from Ayana to identify the

928
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,680
vendors

929
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,599
the second one that Diego identified

930
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,480
pretty early this is data integrity and

931
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,700
making sure that we know that the data

932
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,440
is not changed and the context

933
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,000
information is not changed along the

934
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,619
along the paths

935
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:59,160
Dan bognanovic last time to give us a

936
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,560
good use case in the world of iot where

937
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,540
we've got different devices different

938
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,200
iot devices with different contexts and

939
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,819
with different capabilities so it's

940
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,560
important

941
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,800
something that we want to do is to

942
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,560
properly specify the device and that

943
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,780
relates to the numerous inventory

944
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,900
discussion we've been having recently

945
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,060
and regardless of how we do it we need a

946
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,780
unique ID right and that will be the one

947
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,900
used as well in the

948
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,260
in the platform manifests

949
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,859
so we have uh one extra question

950
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:39,839
by the way the one at the bottom should

951
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,520
be include encoding what you said last

952
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,960
time that we don't want to do that it's

953
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,780
not useful in the platform or the

954
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,480
metering uh the direction manifest so

955
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,000
we've got one open question here which

956
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,859
is about the MDD subscription

957
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,380
so that's the collection of paths right

958
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,720
so you could have one subscription with

959
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,940
multi-part that you observe and somehow

960
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,339
we could even have I observed that pass

961
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,560
part of that subscription with those

962
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,240
parameters but the same pass could be

963
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,920
monitored in a different subscription

964
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,260
with different parameters let's say one

965
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,619
is on change one is like a regular

966
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,480
pushing

967
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,359
and netcomf allows to have XML filters

968
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,819
as well so in a young push so that's a

969
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,819
one thing that we want you to clarify on

970
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,859
which key we want to use so you can

971
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:29,839
follow the open issues there on the link

972
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:33,180
so maybe the last slide and I see people

973
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,280
in the queue that's good so we had

974
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,700
multiple presentation multiple version

975
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,200
uh new draft thanks to feedback from

976
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,540
mediterion nacio and Joe

977
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,660
and that's a question to the chair uh I

978
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,460
believe you would like to

979
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,980
get a Google adoption if you believe

980
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,400
it's fine

981
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,060
there's some

982
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,859
Alex please

983
00:45:55,859 --> 00:46:00,060
yes things I I agree with the problem

984
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,859
statement it's a lot about what to try

985
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,680
to solve but one question that I have is

986
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,200
in in Yang push you're also included

987
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,599
whether the data model itself includes

988
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,000
basically the subscription configuration

989
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,680
which basically includes a lot of the

990
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,060
parameters that you have in your

991
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,819
manifest so hence the question is what

992
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,920
is the difference between what we are

993
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,740
proposing here versus just subscribing

994
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,980
to the subscription to to get to the

995
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,839
subscription notification doesn't this

996
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,119
already give you much of what you need

997
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,140
here

998
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,359
that's a good point Alex so basically

999
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,940
you're right that if we if we have all

1000
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,260
information from the configure

1001
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,540
subscription ID we have all information

1002
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,940
the thing is that I'm trying to say is

1003
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,339
that whenever you move to you know time

1004
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,200
series analytics if you lose that

1005
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,520
information

1006
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,220
you you lost the context so if the

1007
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,220
device was still alive and pingable and

1008
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,780
reachable you could directly go and get

1009
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,819
this information so somehow you're right

1010
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,380
we're sending the subscription ID

1011
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,260
information along with with the data is

1012
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,160
this yes so I so I'm not quite sure so

1013
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,200
how do you sorry I did not fully

1014
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,579
understand that but why is this

1015
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,200
different with a manifest because you

1016
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,480
can always I mean obviously if you lose

1017
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,359
the information or as a client that is

1018
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,339
always an issue but it's irrespective of

1019
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,900
reporting it because in this case in

1020
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,880
both case you're you're streaming that

1021
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,140
information already

1022
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,420
and of course as a as a client you would

1023
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,540
be expected to store that somehow we're

1024
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,000
streaming the data but actually we're

1025
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,420
not streaming the subscription ID

1026
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,040
configuration parameters

1027
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,599
that you could subscribe to those as

1028
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,480
well yes we could obviously yes right

1029
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,560
okay

1030
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,339
good point

1031
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,440
uh Rob Wilson Cisco as a as a

1032
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,300
participant so

1033
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,440
um

1034
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,359
I'm just trying to understand what we

1035
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,280
have today and what how this differs in

1036
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,319
terms of you can always it's essential

1037
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,700
question but you can read gang library

1038
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,040
off the device and know what's there if

1039
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,720
the right system packages you can do

1040
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,700
that so you can get that information and

1041
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,260
embed it is the key difference here

1042
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,180
trying to embed that information into

1043
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,740
the data flow that's coming out of the

1044
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,540
stream Telemetry is that the key thing

1045
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,640
yes and the second question related to

1046
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,980
that is so today obviously with Yang

1047
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,420
library that tells you what the Yang

1048
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,220
models are and that information but the

1049
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,599
other information you're including is

1050
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,000
sort of uh information about the

1051
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,740
subscription the subscription parameters

1052
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,240
how often you're polling that sort of

1053
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,920
thing that's to give the Integrity of

1054
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,960
the data is that yes there are two parts

1055
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,480
so it's not only about the Yang Library

1056
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,220
it's also the information the platform

1057
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,440
right let's assume that there is like a

1058
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,720
bug and now you upgrade you fix that bug

1059
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,180
right you want to get the information

1060
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,300
about the OS version a simple example to

1061
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,680
follow the information of the data

1062
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,599
because in your time series database you

1063
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,099
want to say oh this is before the back

1064
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:49,380
and after back so I want to learn my

1065
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,440
closed captioning not available

1066
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,579
they they will be doing the wrong

1067
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,500
conclusions and then so the last comment

1068
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,000
is I don't know if this is the right

1069
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,200
solution or not because I haven't looked

1070
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,760
at it closely enough I do think this is

1071
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,619
a good problem to be working on I do

1072
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,119
think it's something that's helpful to

1073
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:45,960
solve

1074
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,859
very good thank you

1075
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,280
hi this is Hank

1076
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,079
um no heads on

1077
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,960
so with the uh huge domain of metadata

1078
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,180
so there's a huge amount of metadata you

1079
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,819
are you're opening a whole new world to

1080
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:04,380
your manifest and you're bringing a

1081
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,440
whole new world of telemetry uh to the

1082
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,540
silos I understand that your silos are

1083
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,920
disconnected and you want to connect

1084
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,920
them that's an High School I actually

1085
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,660
support that

1086
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,760
um you were talking about platform and

1087
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,920
then Integrity with Integrity then you

1088
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,980
would use to uh how the data is Con

1089
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,240
conveyed

1090
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,060
so platform Integrity is this whole own

1091
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,640
kind of worms the metadata that you

1092
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,079
described at the moment is just on

1093
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,819
aesthetic and dynamic nodes it's just

1094
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,520
labeled data it's calling that the

1095
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,579
semantic is you use it once in the

1096
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,800
slides often and the idea it appears

1097
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,200
once and that's okay because that's just

1098
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,420
labeling so

1099
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,059
my comment is if you're if you're going

1100
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,220
there there will be a lot of extensions

1101
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,420
later

1102
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,780
all of these extensions will be a cross

1103
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,980
area

1104
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,160
and I would prepare for that moment when

1105
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,260
people realize okay you're talking about

1106
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,480
platforms but what about my platform

1107
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,520
attestation my Integrity my keys my

1108
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,960
trespass in this my intellectual

1109
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,839
security force and all Impact your

1110
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,440
metadata so while you will create the

1111
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,680
first Edge for siloing

1112
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,780
I mean there will be a lot more answers

1113
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,000
I assume I just I assume so that I just

1114
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,280
want to just carefully point out that

1115
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,480
this is an extension Point you're

1116
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,180
creating here and that will be used

1117
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,460
at some point overused maybe there must

1118
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,380
be a good Gateway function and that will

1119
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,020
also be probably has to be captured in

1120
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,180
the ID early on

1121
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,760
I would agree with that right now we see

1122
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,119
a need for a couple of those

1123
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,160
metadata

1124
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,500
parameters or manifest and I believe

1125
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,660
that we're going to require more and

1126
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,180
more of these if we really want to solve

1127
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,720
the closed loop right so uh I I would

1128
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,339
agree with your statement

1129
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:59,160
okay then just make here take care of

1130
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,920
the involve other dealers uh cross

1131
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,359
pollinate

1132
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,800
um via other

1133
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,440
um places here in the ietf and then

1134
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,440
maybe extend on that metadata scheme and

1135
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,000
really make sure that this metadata

1136
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,640
scheme is expecting all these uh

1137
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,140
extensions that we might be incoming

1138
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,859
that would be nice

1139
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,319
the last one yeah no it's it's precisely

1140
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,660
regarding What Hank was mentioning just

1141
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,339
uh uh as benue said is uh somehow my

1142
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:33,180
request to have some mentions so well

1143
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,339
Integrity I was talking about provenance

1144
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:38,040
we started talking about it and that

1145
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,400
includes timeliness and associations and

1146
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,200
everything we are starting to scratch

1147
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,300
the surface I I have been talking this

1148
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,819
is with Zhang about some ideas on how we

1149
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:52,079
can do it in a in a compact enough uh

1150
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,420
way to to deal with this manifest that

1151
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,819
is true that we are yeah at the first

1152
00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:58,319
crack or something that probably is

1153
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,119
going to be um

1154
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:03,000
um so some kind of a flood yeah uh well

1155
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,480
I consider myself an infectious agent

1156
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,960
from me when it comes to these so I I

1157
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,220
guess that we will be talking about

1158
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,079
these in both sides

1159
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:18,020
so I'm I'm very much I guess

1160
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:22,260
thank you how many how many of you in

1161
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,839
this room has read this document

1162
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,078
please

1163
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,559
okay

1164
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,380
hello so I'm going to present you the

1165
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,660
draft about configuration tracing so

1166
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,900
it's on behalf of the Autos over here

1167
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,740
next slide please

1168
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,920
so the the issue is uh sometimes we

1169
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,960
might have a network with um several

1170
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,059
layers of orchestrator controllers and

1171
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,540
is and if there is a configuration going

1172
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,640
wrong at some point we might want to be

1173
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,460
able to trace where that configure where

1174
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,559
that configuration originates from so

1175
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:23,579
for instance a configuration in any two

1176
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:27,059
could be due to some service request in

1177
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,220
orchestrator a and we want to be able to

1178
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,200
trust that back because

1179
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,319
to know if there is a where the mistakes

1180
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,300
come from if there is a mistake in the

1181
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,180
service for instance or if you have like

1182
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,000
two controllers that are fighting over a

1183
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,220
device they might over overwrite each

1184
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,300
other

1185
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,460
or if you have a

1186
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,559
conflicting interns you can also have

1187
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:52,020
this uh this issue that actually it

1188
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,579
would be the lowercase Twitter in that

1189
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,880
case who are fighting each other or just

1190
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,980
the service are not properly defined so

1191
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,040
you might want to to fix that

1192
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,359
um and

1193
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,420
um the of course the the goal of that is

1194
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,339
to be able to automatically resolve the

1195
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:10,200
issue so we need to have a way that a

1196
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,480
software is able to to fix to capture

1197
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,980
and fix that

1198
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,480
uh next slide please

1199
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,920
um so what we have at the moment in the

1200
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,099
devices is that we have the history and

1201
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,400
some metadata Associated to each

1202
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,680
configuration change so some

1203
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,440
configuration metadata

1204
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,900
and the

1205
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,579
so the idea is that usually you have

1206
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:40,859
some kind of identifier that you can use

1207
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,880
to retrieve the time of configuration

1208
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,619
which user did that which protocol they

1209
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:48,780
used and also

1210
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,440
um

1211
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,160
uh the changes most of the time so out

1212
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,760
of that we abstract this into a local

1213
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,359
commit ID which represents that single

1214
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:01,200
ID

1215
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,839
but of course since it's not standard we

1216
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,700
cannot do much better than a string here

1217
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,740
to identify the that particular

1218
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,260
configuration change

1219
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,640
next slide please

1220
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,780
so

1221
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,740
um there was a draft from janineblatt in

1222
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,740
in the net Comfort Group which was kind

1223
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,559
of the trigger for this work

1224
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,380
um so the idea of this draft is uh

1225
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,900
quickly put that you each time you

1226
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,680
configure uh something via netconf but

1227
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,599
the client would push the configuration

1228
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,819
and the server would keep a common

1229
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,380
transaction ID

1230
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,180
that would be Associated to certain

1231
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,839
nodes and then the the the client when

1232
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,180
he has to sync with the with the the

1233
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,020
server or just change the configuration

1234
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,559
uh can check whether the the numbers the

1235
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,140
transaction IDs that they share have

1236
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,819
changed or not and if they have not

1237
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:01,680
changed then you don't have to think

1238
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,099
anything or you can do also configuring

1239
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:08,160
or Niche if the keys is still valid so

1240
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,260
this is a way to to speed up the

1241
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,760
synchronization

1242
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,520
uh and in our case we want to use that

1243
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,480
in order to uh

1244
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,220
see if the

1245
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:24,240
the configuration that was pushed was

1246
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,640
pushed by a particular request from the

1247
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,339
client so because we have this common ID

1248
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:32,339
above the client and the server we can

1249
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:34,559
from the ID on the server find back the

1250
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,740
corresponding transaction in the client

1251
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,118
next slide please

1252
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,940
so here there is some names actually

1253
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,640
um we we might change that because we

1254
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,119
had some commands from Med to use parent

1255
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,240
transaction and child transaction

1256
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,119
so I'm still going to use Northbound and

1257
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,599
southbound here but it's the the same ID

1258
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:04,440
um so in uh in the example here the text

1259
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,339
tx1 would be a self-bond transaction for

1260
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:10,400
the orchestrator

1261
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,440
and uh it would be a Northbound

1262
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,540
transaction for the controller

1263
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,020
and so the the ideas right the main idea

1264
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,880
of our draft is to map

1265
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
the local commit ID

1266
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,300
to uh the corresponding uh North Bond

1267
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,280
and southbound transaction if they exist

1268
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,079
so basically

1269
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,540
in the controller when I receive the

1270
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,500
configuration from tx1 it will change my

1271
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,660
configure my local configuration so I

1272
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,940
will have a local configuration ID I

1273
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,339
will say this was called by orchestrator

1274
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:46,440
with the X1 so this is what you will

1275
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,660
remember

1276
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,960
and uh in the controller what you will

1277
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,900
do is that you will uh and and then you

1278
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,640
will store also Associated to the local

1279
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,520
commit ID the information that in turn

1280
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,940
it pushed the text to index free

1281
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,920
so this is a basically what we want to

1282
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,059
solve but we want to store in the in the

1283
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:12,740
young model so next slide please

1284
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,040
and so in in the young model without

1285
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,140
surprises we have the local

1286
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,040
configuration change local commit ID

1287
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,920
uh as the key and the Azure City tweets

1288
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,900
the list of Northbound transaction ID

1289
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,720
not the single transaction ID that cause

1290
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,940
this configuration the idea of the

1291
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,500
client and the list of servant

1292
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,619
transactionality

1293
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:39,900
next slide please

1294
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,540
so this is uh how we could exploit the

1295
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,020
same model so again without any surprise

1296
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,200
it starts by identifying where there was

1297
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,160
an issue in the ne

1298
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,280
from that we can retrieve the Northbound

1299
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,400
transaction ID and the Northbound client

1300
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,220
ID and we can go back then we know it's

1301
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,720
the controller so we can go back to the

1302
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,160
controller we can say what was the

1303
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,040
transaction for that particular

1304
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,059
transaction ID and we can match then uh

1305
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:16,200
to the to the transaction ID between the

1306
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,240
controller and the orchestrator and find

1307
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,260
back the original service request

1308
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,660
so since it's kind of recursive there is

1309
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,599
no need to to stop oh okay so let's uh

1310
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,100
let's slide

1311
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,339
[Music]

1312
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,579
uh yes perfect

1313
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:45,960
so

1314
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,460
um there are some questions for this

1315
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:51,119
draft so first one is that um

1316
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,460
uh there was a feature for the

1317
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,440
transaction ID this request that the

1318
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,220
client could push the transaction ID

1319
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,980
and so decide what transaction to use so

1320
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,799
that the this could simplify a lot our

1321
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:09,240
our process so what this one moral

1322
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,660
question for for Network actually

1323
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,400
um so this is something that we would

1324
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,559
like to add back

1325
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,160
um so there is a question that we have

1326
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,079
to to identify as well is the risk of

1327
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,359
collision between a self-bond

1328
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:27,020
transaction ideas

1329
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,480
um and so

1330
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,799
um we were wondering whether this uh

1331
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:36,720
using only that for netconf because we

1332
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,420
have the transaction ID is good or

1333
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,220
whether we should also include the

1334
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,839
rescue

1335
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:45,960
so that's another Point uh I think we

1336
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,720
had some feedback from

1337
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,900
from Network which was of course if it

1338
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,400
works on network we should work with

1339
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,020
response as well

1340
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,619
and finally uh there is a draft that is

1341
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,640
solving the exact same problem from Jan

1342
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,000
and uh Rock I think uh

1343
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,760
where their ideas to solve the problem

1344
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,680
is to use trust so basically you send

1345
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,740
the ID and then you you push the you you

1346
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,160
follow the truss of that of that ID but

1347
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,079
this ID is not linked to the to the

1348
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:22,440
transaction and then the trays are sent

1349
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,319
to a collector which maintains the the

1350
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:27,540
information of where each configuration

1351
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,799
went

1352
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:31,260
which is another way to solve the same

1353
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,339
problem

1354
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:36,619
so we will probably work together

1355
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,660
on that to in order to to find a common

1356
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,920
solution

1357
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,480
okay let's try please

1358
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,220
so is it uh so thanks for the review I

1359
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:54,180
made and is it uh is it a problem that

1360
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,780
we need to solve and is our solution an

1361
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:00,299
approach that that seems feedback

1362
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:05,119
uh Ayana I think you have a question

1363
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,480
Cisco could you go back one slide please

1364
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,339
and uh Jan while you're doing that I put

1365
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,319
a poll up on his question is this a

1366
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:20,700
problem to solve

1367
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,140
[Music]

1368
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,720
all right yeah so I definitely support

1369
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,880
this uh problem space as you understand

1370
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,220
I've been involved with two drafts that

1371
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,140
are trying to work on this so I

1372
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,280
definitely think this is important

1373
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,680
especially if you want to take this

1374
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,540
network automation to the next level

1375
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,640
we'll need this sort of thing we get

1376
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,740
hierarchies of orchestrators and

1377
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,839
controllers and this is becoming a more

1378
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,880
and more acute problem

1379
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,220
uh we removed this possibility for

1380
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,220
clients to set the transaction idea

1381
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,040
in the transaction ID draft because that

1382
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,140
was the common consensus or the common

1383
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,119
opinion in the net conf working group at

1384
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:02,760
that time I personally still think it's

1385
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,099
a very interesting thing to to have

1386
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:06,059
there

1387
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:08,280
and we can have certainly discussed that

1388
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,220
and maybe in the new light of all these

1389
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,540
other dresses are coming into the net

1390
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:13,920
Comfort group maybe they will change

1391
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,440
their mind there

1392
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,780
okay

1393
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,280
when it comes to net conference conf yes

1394
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,839
I definitely think we should include

1395
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,760
dress companies as well

1396
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,059
uh and uh talking about this last draft

1397
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:30,420
that is basically highly overlapping

1398
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,940
with this work

1399
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:35,220
that solution would work pretty much the

1400
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,740
same for netconf and rest conf so I

1401
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,240
think that's an advantage and also that

1402
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,859
solution Builds on the World by Web

1403
01:04:40,859 --> 01:04:41,940
Consortium

1404
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,460
already established rest headers and

1405
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,220
stuff like that so it's kind of nice to

1406
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,559
align with existing technology that's in

1407
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:51,059
the field already

1408
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,040
but I would certainly be interested to

1409
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,020
work continue to work together with you

1410
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,579
on this and I think even though there's

1411
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:58,980
great overlap between uh this regardless

1412
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,140
Trace context extension and what you

1413
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,240
have here there are some areas that are

1414
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,040
not exactly the same and uh some

1415
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,540
functionality that's missing in one or

1416
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,220
the other so maybe they could complement

1417
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,640
each other

1418
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,058
thank you thank you

1419
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,280
as robots and Cisco so uh the good to

1420
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,020
hear that you you both sides are willing

1421
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,160
to work together on this problem I think

1422
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,180
that's obviously the right thing to do

1423
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,339
if you can do that in terms of where to

1424
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:31,319
do this work I know you've sort of been

1425
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:35,579
presented both here and in netconf I

1426
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:37,260
think

1427
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,480
um so I wonder whether that comp would

1428
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,619
be a good place to try and coordinate

1429
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:41,760
this because that's also where the

1430
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,140
transaction ID draft is and I think

1431
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,640
they're all closely related so that

1432
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,619
would be my suggestion or the best place

1433
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:48,540
to discuss this

1434
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:52,160
I was going to say the same thing

1435
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,559
uh I do have a comment not as a chair

1436
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:56,520
though

1437
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,440
um so you talked about collusion of

1438
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,740
transaction IDs Collision of client IDs

1439
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,680
and I think client ID was brought up in

1440
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,680
the um netcomp working group it seems to

1441
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,079
me as an arbitrary string with no

1442
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,420
coordination clients could pick the same

1443
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,359
ID and then I wonder how volatile that

1444
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,660
data is because if a device crashes and

1445
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,599
you want to see why it crashed is that

1446
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,119
is your draft talk about Persistence of

1447
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:25,500
that data

1448
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,099
no yes we didn't open that it's uh I

1449
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:31,140
would say yet another inventory problem

1450
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,160
where you need to have a unique ID

1451
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,619
I don't know how to solve that yet

1452
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:39,599
except of saying that every

1453
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,720
client in the in the network should have

1454
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,880
a unique ID and as you say that is

1455
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,160
persistent but I'm not sure whether it's

1456
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,039
really reasonable considering that you

1457
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,319
might actually have orchestrators that

1458
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,299
and controllers that don't belong to the

1459
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:56,299
same are not managed by the semantities

1460
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:59,039
so in that case it becomes it becomes

1461
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,319
harder to to serve to serve that issue

1462
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:05,640
so yes I I I don't have a solution at

1463
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,000
this moment

1464
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:11,760
and uh Rubble Francisco again so in

1465
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,460
terms of conflicting client IDs I think

1466
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,680
I would just push that into the space of

1467
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,839
whoever is do sending those updates down

1468
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,700
to the device and say that they have to

1469
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,220
coordinate so maybe give some advice on

1470
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,440
on how they how they can achieve that

1471
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,819
but

1472
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:28,799
um I I think keep being like an open

1473
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,539
string is probably the right answer and

1474
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:31,680
just saying look

1475
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,299
there are ways this can be avoided by

1476
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,819
putting like the the name of the

1477
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,319
controller that's sending it down or

1478
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:40,200
something in the ID

1479
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,740
okay as chair it looked like there was

1480
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,260
good interest 18 hands were raised no

1481
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,059
hands were not raised so there does seem

1482
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:50,880
to be support for this uh but I do agree

1483
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,740
that I think netcomp might be a better

1484
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,319
area for some of this work

1485
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,759
okay thank you

1486
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,700
yeah it's Camilo Camilo will uh present

1487
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,480
yeah

1488
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,460
it's the same presentation I updated

1489
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,000
headstock

1490
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,738
you may

1491
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:26,238
oh this is cool

1492
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,479
hello so

1493
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:35,399
in behalf of the authors for the draft

1494
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:37,198
data model for life cycle motivation

1495
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,779
operation I'm going to give a bit of

1496
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:42,540
update in the draft my name is Camilo

1497
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,279
Cardona from NTT

1498
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,640
next please

1499
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,679
uh so Marisol already provided an

1500
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,960
overview of this draft in a in a couple

1501
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,420
of it itfs ago so I'm just going to go

1502
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,560
very quickly

1503
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,279
the idea of the draft is to let's say

1504
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,738
um support the life cycle management and

1505
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:05,520
operation of assets uh we have heavy

1506
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,698
scope on on usability of the asset that

1507
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:11,060
is the features that the asset contain

1508
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:14,580
uh the feature usage and the licenses

1509
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,020
that support those feature those

1510
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,560
features this draft is not an inventory

1511
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,779
draft we are uh ideas that we leverage

1512
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:26,819
other drafts that actually Define the

1513
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:27,779
inventory

1514
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,698
uh it seems like there are tons of

1515
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,738
drafts about that and we need consensus

1516
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:35,939
on that but we don't tackle that problem

1517
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:38,540
next please

1518
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:41,219
so the difference from the previous

1519
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,660
versions

1520
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,819
um I mean this the the core of the draft

1521
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:47,939
is a young model so we have been trying

1522
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:50,339
to gather use cases that basically try

1523
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,920
to bring that model to reality as much

1524
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,699
as we can this is an ongoing work so the

1525
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:58,820
more use cases we We Gather the better

1526
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,020
and we're trying to just to tune the

1527
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,640
model based on that so we have been

1528
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,100
tuning the model a bit and we're just on

1529
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,640
that process

1530
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:10,080
yeah next please

1531
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,120
so with that I'm just going to say a few

1532
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,520
words about well one of the Scopes of

1533
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,440
the draft which is licenses feature and

1534
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,780
feature research

1535
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,420
um licenses or features are complex to

1536
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,659
model just as inventories so what we are

1537
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:26,580
going to try to do or what we're trying

1538
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,760
to do is to try to bound the scope of

1539
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,460
what the model can do or not so we can

1540
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,800
process present that to the group and we

1541
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,620
all decide whether this is worthy or not

1542
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,360
uh based on of course the limitations of

1543
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,460
a complex problem

1544
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,980
um however uh well this is ongoing work

1545
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:47,060
but I do want to comment in a few points

1546
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:51,600
uh so I mean just to give you an update

1547
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,659
um first of all licenses are features

1548
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:56,940
the model will not model a catalog of

1549
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,400
them but uh inventory of them inventory

1550
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,960
of features and licenses not of

1551
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,940
inventory of assets

1552
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:06,360
uh what is that a catalog that is uh if

1553
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,280
a company wants to dispose all the all

1554
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,480
the possibilities of features and

1555
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,980
licenses that they have that's an

1556
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,440
extremely complex problem it involves a

1557
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,900
lot of graph and a lot of options and

1558
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,400
that's not what we want to model right

1559
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,520
now so we are not going to model that it

1560
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,900
will be just inventory of feature

1561
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,400
analysis

1562
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,679
the second point is that licenses are

1563
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,719
going to be basically defined as feature

1564
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:29,520
well it will be an upper bound on

1565
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,540
feature usage if a license is just a way

1566
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,100
of giving you permission to use a

1567
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,900
feature then that's fine it will just be

1568
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,640
a limited well if it's just limited in

1569
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,880
time then you just say it but a lot of

1570
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,920
times licenses basically have upper

1571
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,679
bounds on on usage such as okay this can

1572
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:48,840
be used just in ncpus or this can be

1573
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,020
used on with M users or with

1574
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,880
x amount of flows or stuff like that so

1575
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,659
we will Define licenses as that using

1576
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:03,360
the feature usage upper bound

1577
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,600
um multiple times licenses have defined

1578
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,360
limit on multiple uh feature module

1579
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,960
multiple properties uh and we are fine

1580
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,820
with that as long as there is no

1581
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,739
correlation or relationship between the

1582
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:19,860
between them so for instance I'm going

1583
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,540
to read that because if not I forget

1584
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,940
if I license cover something like ncpus

1585
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,420
if you have more than five users uh

1586
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,040
that's let's say kind of complex to

1587
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,960
model we can but then the model will be

1588
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,460
very complex so we are not going to

1589
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,620
cover something like that but we will

1590
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,120
cover stuff like

1591
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,860
um let's say you have an application an

1592
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,500
app a DV database that can be installed

1593
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,100
in many devices but only up to ncpus uh

1594
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,179
that's something that we like to cover

1595
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:48,719
right so you can Define uh this feature

1596
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,780
or this database is installed in and

1597
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:55,320
divide in these devices and this is how

1598
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,060
many CPUs are being used for that

1599
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,120
database in total and you have of course

1600
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,120
your limit on licenses so that's uh our

1601
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,620
status right now next please

1602
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,260
um so that's basically the um the

1603
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,340
overview

1604
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:15,199
um we have a bi-weekly call uh Marisol

1605
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,060
coordinates that so if anybody wants to

1606
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,020
join please send us an email uh well to

1607
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,480
marisolar to any of the authors uh we

1608
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,460
have some notes I mean if anybody wants

1609
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,320
to visit

1610
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,020
um this drop does depend a lot in the

1611
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,199
material in inventory definition

1612
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:37,080
and that seems to be kind of um

1613
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,520
I mean there are a lot of propositions

1614
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,480
for that

1615
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,760
actually I heard of my head of IT how

1616
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,580
that's being handled uh but it does

1617
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:47,400
depend on that so

1618
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,080
um yeah we would like to have some

1619
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,199
feedback on how that inventory part will

1620
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:54,000
be will be steering the working group to

1621
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,159
try to to be able to

1622
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,199
to score better than the draft because

1623
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,000
it does depend a lot on Inventory

1624
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,460
management on inventory assets

1625
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,860
that's it

1626
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,900
real quick we have people in the in the

1627
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,760
queue there there was a side meeting on

1628
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,280
inventory uh that happened here um it

1629
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,380
was shared on the on the list I'm in

1630
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,440
interested and I think uh we have the

1631
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,659
multiple participants in the room some

1632
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:24,540
feedback from that um because I'm very

1633
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,100
curious some of the questions you asked

1634
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,100
about how the authors of this work want

1635
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,600
to move forward

1636
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,860
but uh oh God I think

1637
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:37,320
I just have few comments about the draft

1638
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,600
like the first one would be close to the

1639
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,120
mic the first one would be LMO like you

1640
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,640
know it is uh asset lifecycle management

1641
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,040
operation so I personally find it a

1642
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,440
little bit kind of confusing to have

1643
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,540
life cycle management and operation

1644
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,760
because it doesn't Define the scope it

1645
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,920
could be confused with another things

1646
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,300
that have life cycle and management

1647
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,179
operation the second comment would be I

1648
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:04,199
think you lost one of the modules in

1649
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,960
your latest version

1650
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,600
ITF LMO it was there in version five but

1651
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,179
it disappeared in the latest version so

1652
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:15,780
maybe just check that which module ITF

1653
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,400
LMO

1654
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,140
you have a common and you have the

1655
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,560
others but the the one in between uh is

1656
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,719
was there in version five it's not okay

1657
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,580
here anymore and and another comment is

1658
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,679
about

1659
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,719
bi-directional associations maybe

1660
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,540
um maybe you you can go through another

1661
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,960
review to see if all of them are

1662
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,340
necessary you know or if you could

1663
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,159
reduce their number of bi-directional

1664
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:43,260
Association stuff

1665
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:47,540
okay thanks thank you

1666
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,880
does Alex come yeah I have a I'm also a

1667
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,520
little bit too uh I'm not quite sure why

1668
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,840
this is a separate word from the

1669
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,360
inventory uh management and Licensing

1670
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,780
some of the use cases that you show here

1671
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,980
appear to be things that you would

1672
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:05,520
mostly aggregate at the OSS level so not

1673
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,260
on the individual device level so I

1674
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,060
think clearly basically the licensing is

1675
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,280
about those types of considerations that

1676
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,140
you mentioned are are certainly valid

1677
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,820
but I'm wondering how much of that

1678
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,140
wouldn't I mean wouldn't most of this

1679
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:18,300
occur at the OSS level do you really

1680
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:21,980
need this instrument in the network

1681
01:16:22,219 --> 01:16:24,840
well this is not separate for the

1682
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,460
inventory this highly depends on the

1683
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:29,520
inventory the the this draft does not

1684
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,560
try to tackle inventory that's a

1685
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,739
different story so we are hopefully the

1686
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:37,620
inventory will be defined and modeled in

1687
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,960
another work that's what we're saying

1688
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,000
but we do depend on that a lot that's

1689
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,280
that's the case okay but a lot of some

1690
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,679
of the uses that you said uh really

1691
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:48,360
aggregate stuff across the network you

1692
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,800
say okay basically yeah I have realized

1693
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,600
and I want to have so many users so many

1694
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,100
cores and so forth covered uh what

1695
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,320
confuses me about it is this is stuff

1696
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,300
well I think this clearly this is valid

1697
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,580
but again it would be something that

1698
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,880
you'll Aggregate and consolidate at the

1699
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,980
operation support system level

1700
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,440
at the basically I think at the

1701
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,940
management application or the controller

1702
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,440
level is not really something that you

1703
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,580
would instrument

1704
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,440
as part of the devices I guess that's

1705
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,600
well I mean that's a question that I

1706
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,860
have perhaps I'll

1707
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,719
just leave it as a question for an hour

1708
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:24,480
yeah that's a general question we have

1709
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,280
um whether this information will be

1710
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,640
centralized not on not on a central

1711
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,980
point not maybe on the devices

1712
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,679
that's a good question I I do not know

1713
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,340
thanks

1714
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,719
so Roblox and Cisco

1715
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:42,120
um I think this is like when they ad hat

1716
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,440
on so you asked a question about how

1717
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,940
does this work progress and how does the

1718
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,980
work progress with the um inventory

1719
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,199
models and things so I was there in the

1720
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,780
side meeting uh here as well so he'll

1721
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,159
keep me honest I think it's quite right

1722
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:55,920
so Chin's uh basically my summary of

1723
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,780
that is there's different groups of

1724
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,340
interest in working on the inventory

1725
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,679
models and I think there's interest in

1726
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,300
trying to sort of compare and contrast

1727
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,640
those and maybe bring those together

1728
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,480
those are currently a different working

1729
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,820
groups so some effort needs to needs to

1730
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,679
happen to coordinate those I think the

1731
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:12,360
next step proposed to that is to create

1732
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,560
at least a mailing list to get those

1733
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,000
different parties together and talk

1734
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,860
together we might need some more

1735
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,960
coordination across

1736
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,880
um across the different working groups

1737
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,440
in terms of that I think sort of

1738
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,520
different from this model because I

1739
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,960
think this model is all almost like a

1740
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,400
user of the inventory rather than

1741
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,380
directly having the inventory uh

1742
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,179
embedded in it so I think that's sort of

1743
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:31,920
interesting to decouple those possibly

1744
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,320
and then the last comment and this is

1745
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,780
more wider I think um we had sort of

1746
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:37,920
discussions about how these different

1747
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,420
young models again created different

1748
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,480
working groups get get get

1749
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,520
work together and work as like a

1750
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,400
cohesive set and I think there's an idea

1751
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,560
potentially of trying to spin up a

1752
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,120
working group or a special interest

1753
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,100
group or something like that to try and

1754
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,800
coordinate not just specifically this

1755
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,540
these such young models but Yang more

1756
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,820
generally to see if we can get a sort of

1757
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,980
cohesive set so that's a slight sort of

1758
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,239
side topic but I don't know if chin

1759
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,380
wants to speak any more about the

1760
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,520
meeting but

1761
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,380
um I will create the mailing list

1762
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,760
um and we will go forward from that

1763
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,179
point of view

1764
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,400
just to quickly respond to the robot

1765
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,260
actually yeah we have assigned meeting

1766
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:26,040
yesterday and we I think yeah uh really

1767
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,260
want to you know in a high level uh

1768
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,699
reach agreement and for the terminology

1769
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:33,300
school and we single uh can we can have

1770
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,179
a synergize effort to work on this so

1771
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:40,020
we'll uh actually request the lady to

1772
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,440
create a minister for this thank you

1773
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,040
foreign

1774
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,679
no hats

1775
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,600
unfortunately it was blocked headed

1776
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,460
sight reading yesterday so I would have

1777
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,400
loved to pretend that um have not having

1778
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,679
now read anything about the minutes or

1779
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:00,659
the notes about that you're talking

1780
01:20:00,659 --> 01:20:02,219
about licensees

1781
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,020
and um

1782
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,040
a lot of uh working groups sorry

1783
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,880
communities out there curate those lists

1784
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,380
um especially in the software world

1785
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,780
there's a list about

1786
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:17,100
465 licenses

1787
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,900
and then I see that you are talking

1788
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,600
about uh parameterizing those because

1789
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,600
number of users which again would

1790
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,260
multiply the options how to represent

1791
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,659
licenses and that's just for software

1792
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:35,040
the OSS that was mentioned by avex and

1793
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,679
it might be confusing things and that is

1794
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,620
that is my question so why is the

1795
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,980
licensing here different and why is the

1796
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,040
licensing here I I a simpler inventory

1797
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,320
solution then everywhere else and I

1798
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,239
think that is something that Robert was

1799
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:52,620
not standing out for me on the slides

1800
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,719
and again I apologize for not being able

1801
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,840
to attend the uh side meeting here I

1802
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,140
might not be able to answer the question

1803
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,580
directly because

1804
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:06,600
of defining licenses in general here

1805
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,600
um uh we are maybe it has another name

1806
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,580
right uh maybe here what we are defining

1807
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,820
is uh licenses in in terms of your

1808
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,620
ability of being able to run a feature

1809
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,480
or a product

1810
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,219
um database you have a license to run a

1811
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:23,820
database in a server and how to define

1812
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,560
how much

1813
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,560
uh

1814
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,440
how much you can use that feature in

1815
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,780
terms of properties so how many users

1816
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,820
can use the feature not so much of

1817
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,120
licenses of software like MIT or not

1818
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,280
like that and it is indeed confusing to

1819
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,780
me because I cannot really Define what

1820
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,159
the difference is and why it has the

1821
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:47,520
same word I I so I I won't be able to

1822
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,440
answer that because it's over my

1823
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,300
capabilities right now overloaded yes

1824
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,820
yeah so so that is exactly the thing the

1825
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,280
scope that should be

1826
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,020
obvious like at the start what's the

1827
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,580
scope of the licensing so you're trying

1828
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,960
to manage it for the inventory because

1829
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,780
everybody else will jump on this

1830
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,920
depending on their experience that's

1831
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,080
what they will think and and and and to

1832
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,440
be honest with you I I what I I was

1833
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,540
thinking maybe I should say this but I

1834
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,400
was I maybe I will get myself into

1835
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,380
trouble trying to describe this in the

1836
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,060
middle of the presentation but it's very

1837
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:19,860
valid and it is definitely not what

1838
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,179
we're trying to cover but something else

1839
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:23,159
so we do need to be more clear about

1840
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:25,639
that yes

1841
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,300
yeah

1842
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,719
yeah that's very very good yeah yeah

1843
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,520
that sounds very accurate

1844
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,679
well this is Diego the one that uh

1845
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:37,800
speaks suffer Hank normally and uh yeah

1846
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,100
just just a a reflection that is very

1847
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,800
much to support what uh Rob and dancing

1848
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,300
were mentioning

1849
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,520
is that we are we are reaching the point

1850
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,920
in which we are touching uh we're

1851
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,739
extending the idea of that we can read

1852
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:55,620
and modify the configuration of a device

1853
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,480
and we are reaching the moment in which

1854
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,159
everything that has to do with the

1855
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:00,540
operational

1856
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,440
um

1857
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,739
environment of the device including

1858
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:06,420
entitlements and including the different

1859
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,760
modules to be available and the and the

1860
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,340
and the inventories Etc and we and we

1861
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,840
are touching we are reaching the moment

1862
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,400
in which we are interacting with other

1863
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,239
kind of databases another kind of data I

1864
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,820
think it is worth considering precisely

1865
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:24,420
to start whatever a group in which this

1866
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,520
is at least coordinated

1867
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,280
so we are not having things that are

1868
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,380
happening in NETCOM funding we realize

1869
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,900
here that anything else is is going on

1870
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,820
Etc so I believe it's very interesting

1871
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,739
and probably I don't know if we are

1872
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:40,560
going to I don't know a mentors group or

1873
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,920
a working group dedicated to we should

1874
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,420
have to to take a operational

1875
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,400
completeness or whatever I don't know I

1876
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,380
don't know the name but it will be quite

1877
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,260
interesting and he's a and it's part I

1878
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,000
believe of the Natural Evolution of the

1879
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,640
maturity of the of the Jiang approach

1880
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,960
for modeling and control

1881
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,880
uh sir Robertson ad so I think it will

1882
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,080
create the mailing list and that'd be a

1883
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,460
good place to then have these sort of

1884
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,620
discussions to see if if there's sort of

1885
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,360
interest and we confirm this up one way

1886
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,960
or another but

1887
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:20,159
uh Paul from Valley uh I just have a

1888
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,739
clarification question on this uh

1889
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:25,800
because you define the asset it's also

1890
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,800
it doesn't specify the scope it's only

1891
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,260
see there's could be physical software

1892
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,719
or true so I'm not sure whether it

1893
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:37,620
contains order like it Assets in the

1894
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,400
Enterprise Network

1895
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:45,179
how to Define asset uh at least we are

1896
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:48,060
considering the scope

1897
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,860
something that is not physical so for

1898
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,560
instance a VM can also be an asset so

1899
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,340
there's software assets but

1900
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,100
maybe I haven't thought how much to

1901
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,600
Define it so I cannot really tell you

1902
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,000
whether that's a yes or a no but uh yeah

1903
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,820
I I guess the ability of a model to be

1904
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,980
able to also cover that

1905
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:12,679
uh it shows how good the model is

1906
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:15,840
if we have more use cases then we will

1907
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,840
we should be able to Accord to correlate

1908
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,640
what you say to see if the model covers

1909
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:25,340
it so but uh right now I do not know

1910
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,620
I'm sorry

1911
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,140
interest of time where we're closing the

1912
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,179
queue so please these are great

1913
01:25:33,179 --> 01:25:36,179
conversations to have on the list thank

1914
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:38,780
you Camille

1915
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:42,739
okay next for

1916
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,080
thank you

1917
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:01,639
nope

1918
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:06,719
hello hello everyone uh my name is Boho

1919
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,880
and I'm here uh present uh the

1920
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,239
a network inventory model on behalf of

1921
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:18,060
my co-authors

1922
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,580
okay thanks

1923
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:24,840
next slide please uh the model uh the

1924
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,300
problem this model is trying to solve

1925
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:30,840
with that uh in the current Enterprise

1926
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:35,159
Network uh the we have different domains

1927
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:38,360
like campus network uh

1928
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,880
uh currently we have also like sd1

1929
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,880
Network to cover the one connection and

1930
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,100
also there could be data center Network

1931
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,179
or a cloud Network so each this network

1932
01:26:51,179 --> 01:26:54,260
may have its own uh Network

1933
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:58,860
inventory model to expose to to the OSS

1934
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,780
system

1935
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,060
uh

1936
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:06,000
but uh on the right uh you can see the

1937
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,300
figure that uh we we give here uh uh

1938
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,760
Enterprise Network abstraction uh

1939
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,620
network uh and security function

1940
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:17,699
abstraction here that uh in order to do

1941
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,340
those uh like security policies to be

1942
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:24,000
consistent and also the service so

1943
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,060
policy could be consistent we need uh

1944
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,840
like a end-to-end point of view to like

1945
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,239
collected all those uh all those

1946
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:37,820
inventory uh status to make it

1947
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:42,360
this policy could be consistent

1948
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,960
the problem here we try to like we need

1949
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,540
to understand what the current status of

1950
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,620
network

1951
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,699
so we think Network inventory can help

1952
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:55,460
get this uh

1953
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:59,900
accurate status next slide please

1954
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,659
here I gave just some concrete example

1955
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:08,460
here

1956
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:10,260
oh wait wait

1957
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,860
uh in our input implementation we see

1958
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:19,080
that there's a more iot Terminals and it

1959
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:23,340
OT sensors Wi-Fi uh bring your own

1960
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,820
devices all those endpoints they are

1961
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,540
moving uh in some different way and we

1962
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,360
also have some remote worker endpoints

1963
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,460
that could be connected to an Android

1964
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,219
device Network and also there could be

1965
01:28:38,219 --> 01:28:42,900
some Cloud Network endpoints so here uh

1966
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,519
in next slide please

1967
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,440
oh

1968
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:53,639
um I I just grew uh just recap what the

1969
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:56,940
the problem is we are thinking that

1970
01:28:56,940 --> 01:29:00,060
um we need uh

1971
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:03,239
a complete view of this network and its

1972
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:05,760
status and we think the endpoints and

1973
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,139
network nodes uh some some like

1974
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:13,199
some places that we can get all those

1975
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:16,440
Network information uh and here I give

1976
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,620
some like Network inventory documents

1977
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,739
that may be relevant uh like in this

1978
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:25,560
working group we also have the service

1979
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,380
attachment points but that uh I think

1980
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,540
that job is mailing for the service

1981
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:34,980
provider domain and also uh ccamp has

1982
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,159
that physical Network inventory but we

1983
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,920
think our work here is quite different

1984
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,500
from that one because that inventory is

1985
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,260
just about from the hardware inventory

1986
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,219
View

1987
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:49,800
and uh

1988
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,620
a previous slide uh presentation is

1989
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:56,159
about asset Centric uh I mean life cycle

1990
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,360
management

1991
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,900
so I think these uh works are quite

1992
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:04,380
relevant but I I think still there are

1993
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,219
some parts missing there so next slide

1994
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:10,340
please

1995
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,780
so here uh in in this uh

1996
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,719
the inventory model that we presented

1997
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,380
here where we we are suggesting uh we

1998
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,219
can like augment current ietap Network

1999
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,840
model that to

2000
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,800
uh adding a like software uh or or

2001
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,679
Hardware components to the current ietf

2002
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:38,420
Network

2003
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:41,820
notes and also uh adding more

2004
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:44,699
information about IP address Mac address

2005
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:48,840
or some software information and also

2006
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,440
endpoints information to the current

2007
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:56,040
Network model so in that way we think in

2008
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,179
this way we can get a better Network

2009
01:30:59,179 --> 01:31:02,880
status from this model

2010
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,139
so

2011
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:07,800
I think that's it's all about the model

2012
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,340
so I like to hear there are some

2013
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,280
comments on on our

2014
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:17,059
proposal

2015
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,000
uh

2016
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,440
zadie I only said quite made previously

2017
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,639
to to coordinate with the other people

2018
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:33,840
doing the same sort of stuff and trying

2019
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,440
to get to a common thing okay

2020
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,440
foreign

2021
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:03,840
so hello everyone this is Susan from

2022
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,560
Huawei so so there is a version of the

2023
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,199
draft and the name is policy-based

2024
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,659
network access control so next slide

2025
01:32:12,659 --> 01:32:14,900
please

2026
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,699
foreign

2027
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:20,520
so for the problem statement let's say

2028
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,460
that is uh at the Enterprise Network

2029
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:27,300
scenario where one of its employees one

2030
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,219
of his employees let's say he's a

2031
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:31,860
Salesman support that and

2032
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:35,340
who needs to usually travel a lot from

2033
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,679
one branch to another

2034
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,460
and work in different branches and such

2035
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:44,760
the mobile office will make the his IP

2036
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,239
addresses change very frequently but

2037
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,420
from the others from the company's

2038
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:55,560
perspective that such employee has a

2039
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,639
quite stable role in the company and a

2040
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:00,960
unified

2041
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,179
permission control of the network

2042
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:04,620
resources

2043
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:08,520
uh yeah let's say that for example the

2044
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,040
company would like to restrict his

2045
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:15,179
employee to access the YouTube for Video

2046
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:17,699
Entertainment during the work hours

2047
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:20,580
every workday and

2048
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:23,400
the company would like to release that

2049
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:26,760
restriction during the work hours and

2050
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,300
weekends so in this case the controller

2051
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,520
needs to

2052
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,699
interact with the SL policy enforcement

2053
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:39,840
devices very frequently to modify the SL

2054
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:43,139
policies depending on the IP addresses

2055
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:48,120
and the time of the day so we think that

2056
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,880
these different security policies need

2057
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,300
to be applied to even some user but

2058
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,120
under different circumstances it will be

2059
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,460
applied different policies

2060
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:02,940
it also this also not only requires the

2061
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,620
frequent interaction between the

2062
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:07,260
controller and the policy enforcement

2063
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:10,380
devices but also will consume a huge

2064
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:13,560
number of SEO entries so next slide

2065
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,800
please

2066
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:21,420
yeah so the question is can we do better

2067
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:24,360
for this scenario and our proposal we

2068
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:27,120
would like to ensure the enforcement of

2069
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,060
Access Control policies based on a user

2070
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,760
group identity for example if we can

2071
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:35,699
Define that as a user group of cells

2072
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:38,100
then we can say that during the

2073
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:42,179
every work hour and and we would work

2074
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:45,360
there and I work there he can deny that

2075
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:49,080
sales to the destination and it gives a

2076
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,060
time of the depth parameter and then

2077
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,920
during the off hours and the weekends

2078
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,679
there is another policies without the

2079
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,380
non-workout parameter and here I would

2080
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:01,980
like to mention that the Judo group we

2081
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,500
could defined as an identity that

2082
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:07,139
represents the collective identity of a

2083
01:35:07,139 --> 01:35:09,900
group of users and also refers to the

2084
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,940
ones who obsess the Enterprise Network

2085
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,880
and consume specific network resources

2086
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,080
or services

2087
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:19,159
next slide please

2088
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,360
yeah so here is the young modules which

2089
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,420
we call the UCL extension to the young

2090
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:31,620
to SL model and here we augmented the SL

2091
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:34,980
match container with a new Choice named

2092
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:38,159
user control group and inside the user

2093
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,719
control group we have the source match

2094
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:41,940
and destination match and inside each

2095
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:44,580
match there could be the user group

2096
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:47,300
identity parameter and also could Define

2097
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:52,580
an ipv for IPv6 prefix and also we

2098
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:57,060
augmented the SCE for each SL for each

2099
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,760
Access Control entry we like to define a

2100
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,699
Time range parameters to realize the

2101
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:05,820
time variance accessible policies so

2102
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:08,400
that here we can cover the four times

2103
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,880
four types of Access Control the group

2104
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,239
to the group access and IP prefix to

2105
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:18,360
ibuprofit success and group to IP prefix

2106
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,239
access and also the IP practice to group

2107
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:22,260
success

2108
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:25,400
so next slide please

2109
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,199
and there is still another missing piece

2110
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:31,500
because of the the Euro group might be a

2111
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,440
quite abstract concept it might be hard

2112
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,020
for the devices to understand that

2113
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,420
you're the group so we still need some

2114
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:42,239
way to realize the group ID to address

2115
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,980
mapping

2116
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:47,520
so here are we just get a list two

2117
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,940
alternatives to realize that maybe one

2118
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:53,840
that support that the user needs to

2119
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,000
convert his username and password to the

2120
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,500
triple a client

2121
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,040
uh who need to oh

2122
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,679
which gives a sense the request to the

2123
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:07,320
Triple S server and got the user group

2124
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,960
ID then the triple a client could

2125
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:13,320
maintain that mapping of the user group

2126
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:17,219
and his IP addresses and if that if that

2127
01:37:17,219 --> 01:37:20,219
triple a client also collides with the

2128
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:23,159
SL policy enforcement point then he

2129
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:25,080
already got the mapping between the

2130
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,760
group ID and the IP address so it's easy

2131
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:33,420
to act on the user group best Access

2132
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:36,960
Control policy and another way

2133
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,980
another alternative if we say that the

2134
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,980
triple a client is not collected with

2135
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:48,000
the slpp then in this case then triple a

2136
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,580
client could just report his maybe

2137
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,560
information to the controller and then

2138
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,139
the SLP be good query that map

2139
01:37:55,139 --> 01:37:57,480
information from the controller and then

2140
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,060
got the mapping information to the act

2141
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,520
action on the access

2142
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,940
control policies so two alternatives to

2143
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:08,520
realize the group had to address mapping

2144
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:12,179
yeah so next slide please

2145
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:15,860
so I I think that's it

2146
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,340
so uh Robertson Cisco no hats so the one

2147
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,380
thing I have concern here is the sort of

2148
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,719
time-based aspect of the configuration

2149
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,000
and that's only because it feels like

2150
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,219
it's a very specific solution to this

2151
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:37,500
particular thing whereas I wonder

2152
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,139
whether if we want to have time-based

2153
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:41,760
configuration we'd want to solve that

2154
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,679
more generically and have a more generic

2155
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,199
solution for allowing configuration to

2156
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:48,060
change over time although I have to say

2157
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,100
I'm not entirely sure whether pushing

2158
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,659
that down to the device makes sense or

2159
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,100
whether it's better just to have the

2160
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,320
controller updating the configuration on

2161
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,840
time at various points of the day so I

2162
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,580
know some of the other os's do support

2163
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,440
time-based configuration changes so

2164
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,960
that's my thought here yeah thank you

2165
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,960
thanks maybe you could consider that

2166
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,460
into the next word thank you

2167
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,620
um Joe is uh chair this was presented in

2168
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,780
netmod um yesterday I think it was

2169
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:18,780
yesterday uh and um there was that the

2170
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,159
chairs there

2171
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,739
gave us kind of first right of refusal

2172
01:39:22,739 --> 01:39:25,620
so I've got a a poll here to see if

2173
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,239
there's interest in in working on this

2174
01:39:27,239 --> 01:39:29,760
problem I promised chin I'd read this

2175
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,920
but in interest of time I did the

2176
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,440
interest of time I do have some comments

2177
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,840
but I will take them to the list and I

2178
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:40,260
will relinquish my time to David

2179
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:43,260
foreign

2180
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:49,560
like in this scenario accessing YouTube

2181
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:54,780
um you you have user groups and IPS

2182
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:57,500
um defined but then your example YouTube

2183
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:01,380
was a domain and so the salesman going

2184
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,060
to different branch offices is going to

2185
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,179
query this domain and get different IPS

2186
01:40:05,179 --> 01:40:06,900
and so

2187
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:10,620
is this something that you're assuming

2188
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,659
some other system is tracking all the

2189
01:40:12,659 --> 01:40:15,420
different IPS YouTube is on from

2190
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:18,600
different branch offices or

2191
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:21,900
um I wasn't seeing how it covers the use

2192
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,520
case so

2193
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,500
um I was just curious how

2194
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:28,580
you were framing that problem

2195
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,139
uh my understanding actually this has

2196
01:40:34,139 --> 01:40:35,400
been

2197
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,380
also discussed in an end mode so for

2198
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:40,139
your question actually one one of the

2199
01:40:40,139 --> 01:40:43,739
you know uh scenario actually you may

2200
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:46,500
have policy server you need to uh

2201
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:49,219
you know

2202
01:40:50,219 --> 01:40:54,060
uh your your user group for different

2203
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,580
for your Department financial r d

2204
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,920
department so this can be installed in

2205
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:02,760
the policy server and uh so this policy

2206
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,600
will be enforced on specific Network

2207
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:09,780
device so you can use this and to

2208
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,659
restrict access for

2209
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:17,480
for specific youth group so yeah

2210
01:41:21,739 --> 01:41:23,880
asking about domains because you didn't

2211
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,620
Define domains here but the example was

2212
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:26,940
you're trying to restrict access to a

2213
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:28,679
domain but there's no definition of a

2214
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:31,500
domain like youtube.com here

2215
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,900
so

2216
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,900
um

2217
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:41,239
how how is that done here

2218
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,760
yeah I think you raised a very good

2219
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,760
question so the idea is you know here's

2220
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,980
a really you know probably the concept

2221
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:52,080
for the attribute based the network

2222
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,760
access control so we can add more

2223
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,840
attribute to to cover your use cases so

2224
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,699
yeah that's a kernel whatever you

2225
01:41:59,699 --> 01:42:02,940
thought I think yeah uh could be a good

2226
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:04,739
point actually where you can think about

2227
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:07,500
how to resolve this

2228
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,360
uh another

2229
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,420
I want to respond to Robo yeah this also

2230
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:16,139
be discussed in net model so there's one

2231
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:18,540
another proposal ACL extension in

2232
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:23,639
nanomotive so for time uh related uh

2233
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:26,820
uh attribute could be you know be

2234
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:29,580
generalized in ACL extension model so we

2235
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:34,219
can reference from there yeah

2236
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,239
thank you

2237
01:42:39,239 --> 01:42:42,420
okay next step Michael please quickly go

2238
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:45,199
some uniforms

2239
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,980
three minutes

2240
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,179
this is the right slide

2241
01:42:57,179 --> 01:42:59,100
um so you see these documents a bunch of

2242
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:02,159
times over the to maybe two three five

2243
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,619
eight twelve years

2244
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:07,099
um next slide

2245
01:43:07,739 --> 01:43:10,320
um and we had a bunch of conversations

2246
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,320
we tried to adopt some of them last year

2247
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,080
um and uh didn't really get adopted

2248
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,000
together it was weird

2249
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,360
um so the major loudest suggestion from

2250
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,219
Carson vorman and I'm not really sure if

2251
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:25,619
it was consensus in the end

2252
01:43:25,619 --> 01:43:28,500
um was that this solution to the problem

2253
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,900
of these documents being not exactly

2254
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:33,540
standards truck and not exactly really

2255
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:36,780
being able to be ietf control was to

2256
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:39,060
extract the piece that required a

2257
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:40,679
standards track which was the part that

2258
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:42,900
creates the registry

2259
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,940
and put in a new document and so there

2260
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:48,239
it is Richardson Ops a wgb cap link type

2261
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:51,019
next slide

2262
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:54,060
um it's really boring document it

2263
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,940
consists of uh the part on the right for

2264
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:59,699
about uh 12 Pages

2265
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:00,960
um I talked to Ayanna about whether

2266
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,659
they'd like this an XML file format and

2267
01:44:03,659 --> 01:44:05,820
they said oh yes please

2268
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:08,340
um and that's really all it is um part

2269
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:10,139
an important part on the left that you

2270
01:44:10,139 --> 01:44:12,239
can see is that there is a ionic

2271
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,159
consideration specification cards first

2272
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,320
come first served and we have some

2273
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,600
numbers as private use

2274
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,760
um it's actually um sometimes a 32-bit

2275
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,500
field but there are implementations

2276
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,280
where it's a 16-bit field like in netbsd

2277
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,619
um so that's why we keep in that but

2278
01:44:28,619 --> 01:44:30,540
there are actually extra bits in most

2279
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,340
implementations if someone thinks that

2280
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:35,699
65 000 is not enough for the end of the

2281
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:39,000
world we're only at about 290 right now

2282
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,440
okay

2283
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,940
um and that includes a whole generous

2284
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:44,880
amount of uh also private uses in the

2285
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,580
lower numbers plus local uses and stuff

2286
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:50,460
and then I would say over half of these

2287
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:53,340
are probably dead in various formats

2288
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,619
forms but it's impossible to really know

2289
01:44:55,619 --> 01:44:57,960
next slide please yeah

2290
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,420
uh so the the short of it is please

2291
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,520
adopt this document

2292
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,800
um the pcap document then you could we

2293
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,420
could publish it in any way we like

2294
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:09,060
including ISE 80 sponsored through the

2295
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,340
working group I recommend we publish it

2296
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:12,659
as historic

2297
01:45:12,659 --> 01:45:15,179
okay uh yeah there's lots and lots of

2298
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:16,739
use of it but nobody should be writing

2299
01:45:16,739 --> 01:45:19,380
new code against it the pcapp NG and

2300
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:21,360
gosh I hate the word NG in everything

2301
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,940
but that's where it is

2302
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:24,900
um

2303
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,940
um we could publish it as informational

2304
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:29,460
it potentially could have a 2.0 at some

2305
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:32,219
point or is that a 3.0 I don't know

2306
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:34,619
um or we could do it as informational

2307
01:45:34,619 --> 01:45:37,500
um in the normal not in our control

2308
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,000
um and both will reference P kaplink

2309
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,920
type registration and that's probably

2310
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:44,159
the last slide next slide

2311
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:46,440
yeah and I just said that oh and we had

2312
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,520
another document remember already

2313
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,739
removed a bunch of stuff out of it that

2314
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:52,860
was um like there's a systemd block info

2315
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:55,260
and I said all those things already

2316
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:58,159
I think that's it

2317
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:11,520
all right so what about some uh so I

2318
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,600
think this is I don't know what has

2319
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,980
happened I think this is interesting

2320
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,360
work I think it'd be nice for the idea

2321
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,920
to publish this um so I think it's

2322
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,719
finally the right way to publish this my

2323
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:19,860
preference we've tried to get through a

2324
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:21,300
working group that's always good for as

2325
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,219
an idea because it's less work I'd

2326
01:46:23,219 --> 01:46:24,420
rather this go through the eye test than

2327
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,460
the ice e but if that has to if you're

2328
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,199
actually then fine but yes I think we

2329
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:29,100
should try and get this done because

2330
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,080
it's helpful for the community it's good

2331
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,820
to do I would rather just have this ring

2332
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:35,040
group adopt or clearly adopt all three

2333
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,260
documents and then specify them and I

2334
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:38,880
think we can move very quickly to

2335
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,800
working with last call that sounds good

2336
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,179
to me

2337
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:44,780
foreign

2338
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,420
welcome to the Ops area portion of your

2339
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:54,000
program uh with your hosts uh Warren

2340
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,760
Kumari and Rob Wilton I will be taking

2341
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,719
minutes

2342
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:03,920
sorry the Lord Warren Kumari

2343
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:06,900
able so just while we're setting up I'll

2344
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,000
make some quick comments

2345
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,219
um just to say that the Ops director

2346
01:47:11,219 --> 01:47:13,199
we've had a few people that have dropped

2347
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:15,119
out of that the Ops directorate reviews

2348
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,100
are really helpful for Warren and I when

2349
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:18,239
we're overloaded with work because

2350
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,100
people's opinions

2351
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,300
um and sort of comments on those

2352
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,100
documents help tell us whether we need

2353
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:25,500
to uh to look at these documents closely

2354
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,540
and review them closely or whether we

2355
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:29,280
can say no actually there aren't any Ops

2356
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,900
area issues that we need to worry about

2357
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:31,980
this

2358
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:33,480
um so if there's people who've got a

2359
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,159
good experience and are willing to help

2360
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:37,199
join that directorate that would be

2361
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,940
great to really appreciate that

2362
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,679
um so be really helpful and then the

2363
01:47:40,679 --> 01:47:43,260
other thing to point out is that uh the

2364
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:46,199
next non-com cycle is happening and so

2365
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:47,760
um again we've got three people up for

2366
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,800
uh the Ops

2367
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,020
um ad roll and again if you can provide

2368
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:53,580
comments back to non-com on the

2369
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,080
different candidates that helps them a

2370
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,880
lot in terms of sort of choosing

2371
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,800
candidates so please please provide me

2372
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,639
feedback if you can

2373
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,380
yeah what Rob said

2374
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:06,239
um also somebody can let me share slides

2375
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,100
that would be awesome

2376
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,040
um

2377
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,540
yeah Kyon run I think has the current

2378
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:15,060
slide share of nut

2379
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:15,960
um

2380
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,540
yes the upstart record stuff is

2381
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,400
incredibly helpful to us

2382
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,260
um it's also a nice easy way to sort of

2383
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:24,659
get your feet wet with with something

2384
01:48:24,659 --> 01:48:25,739
that's

2385
01:48:25,739 --> 01:48:27,619
um sort of provides leadership type

2386
01:48:27,619 --> 01:48:30,300
experience without the scariness

2387
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,860
and

2388
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,139
um is General driving the slides or am I

2389
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:35,520
driving this late

2390
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,460
um

2391
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,679
whichever people

2392
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:43,619
okay okay if you're sharing you can do

2393
01:48:43,619 --> 01:48:45,540
it

2394
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,159
um so I believe that this is being

2395
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:49,860
presented by tourless if sure this is

2396
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:52,040
about

2397
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,440
all right thank you just a quick um

2398
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,540
uh reach out to the operator Community

2399
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:03,540
coming from another area routing

2400
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:06,119
um this is kind of I take it on a draft

2401
01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:08,520
that we have but next slide this is

2402
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,440
really going back to

2403
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:10,980
um

2404
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:14,900
the fact that we did start a

2405
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,860
deterministic networking working group

2406
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:19,739
in the routing area to improve services

2407
01:49:19,739 --> 01:49:23,340
in networks um and it started out

2408
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,800
um really with use cases where a lot of

2409
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,960
operators and applications owners were

2410
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:30,239
coming in very early on that took a

2411
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,639
couple of years we got the problem

2412
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,400
statement these use cases which are a

2413
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,860
good subset of what we're now seeing and

2414
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:39,659
the architecture and then of course a

2415
01:49:39,659 --> 01:49:41,420
humongous number of

2416
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:44,040
rfcs to actually specify the forwarding

2417
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,460
plane in networks and then recently

2418
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,739
um this year we started to figure out

2419
01:49:49,739 --> 01:49:52,619
that we do see gaps in what we have

2420
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:55,440
achieved primarily also to critical

2421
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,659
things that we were suggested not to do

2422
01:49:57,659 --> 01:50:00,719
for the first few years right that up to

2423
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:03,239
now was um you you should really only

2424
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:05,040
use in the forwarding plane what we have

2425
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,719
because changing forwarding plane is

2426
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:09,179
always difficult so and that has been

2427
01:50:09,179 --> 01:50:11,940
added as a potential

2428
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:14,460
um option to the Charter now and one of

2429
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:16,080
the things that we primarily identify

2430
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,000
next slide

2431
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,719
is that oh wait a second no there is one

2432
01:50:21,719 --> 01:50:23,639
one more slide of a summary for those of

2433
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:26,460
you who haven't been to that net more

2434
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:29,100
recently so what what that net does

2435
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:29,880
um

2436
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,119
in my view right is uh any subset of

2437
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:36,659
services for traffic for customers

2438
01:50:36,659 --> 01:50:40,320
um that guarantee bandwidth for flows

2439
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,080
um which is a per flow setup by a

2440
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,239
controller the maximum guaranteed end

2441
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:47,400
latency of traffic flows which can

2442
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,500
leverage you know whatever Qs can

2443
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:50,699
support this at this point in time

2444
01:50:50,699 --> 01:50:52,800
that's one of the big gaps it can only

2445
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,440
leverage technologies that are primarily

2446
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,260
driven from IEEE layer to TSN

2447
01:50:58,260 --> 01:50:59,580
um and

2448
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,860
um then and that's another uh of the big

2449
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:03,840
components a reduction of loss in the

2450
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:07,139
network through use of routing for a

2451
01:51:07,139 --> 01:51:09,300
diverse path duplicating traffic and

2452
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,040
merging the duplicates on the receiver

2453
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,080
side right so these are kind of the

2454
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,000
three big building blocks throughput

2455
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,900
latency

2456
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,639
um and a reduction of loss and then of

2457
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:22,739
course all the components uh needed to

2458
01:51:22,739 --> 01:51:24,840
operationalize that in the network OEM

2459
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,540
and the controller plane uh via young

2460
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:30,360
models for these Services right so now

2461
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,580
back to next slide

2462
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:35,580
what I wanted uh to talk about so where

2463
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:37,199
are these gaps and obviously you know

2464
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:39,300
one way is to reflect it back to to you

2465
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,219
and that's really what what what I hope

2466
01:51:41,219 --> 01:51:43,500
to do the Outreach here for

2467
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,900
um when we started to look into it and

2468
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,820
I'm going to go into more detail from

2469
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,920
the next slide we felt that there was a

2470
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,020
lot of things that that net can do very

2471
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:55,020
nicely in the networks where people who

2472
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,480
came in uh had the background from which

2473
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:00,119
is industrial networks campus networks

2474
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:02,880
where TSN is working in where customers

2475
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,380
have just been asking we don't only want

2476
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:06,179
to do layer 2 switching we also want to

2477
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:08,880
have that working on IP But ultimately

2478
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,100
you know when we looked into

2479
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,900
uh what are the forwarding planes we

2480
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,420
have a lot of components we built are

2481
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,400
only available right now in mpls in the

2482
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,920
data plane and there has been much less

2483
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,199
resistance to even do small uh changes

2484
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:23,100
so

2485
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,719
um a good amount of what we want to

2486
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,340
achieve is not available on the IP

2487
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:28,380
forwarding plane so that's one limit

2488
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:30,360
even for that but the primary limit is

2489
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,820
that especially us vendors were looking

2490
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,980
at a lot of the design and thinking this

2491
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:38,100
will not scale to large area networks

2492
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:41,940
um in uh um sorry wide area networks and

2493
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:44,520
high-speed networks next slide

2494
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:48,420
and so that's how how we came together

2495
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:50,460
um vendors and and operators started to

2496
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,500
write problem statement explain these

2497
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,760
problems

2498
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,340
um and uh so from the vendor perspective

2499
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:59,880
uh I'm working for for uh Huawei

2500
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:00,719
um

2501
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:02,760
the the um

2502
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:05,400
the cost of building routers that have

2503
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,739
these services at 100 gigabit or 400

2504
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:09,780
gigabit for Metropolitan access or

2505
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,760
larger networks it's really one of the

2506
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,500
concerns where we feel that we need

2507
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,780
better scalable uh cheaper to build

2508
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:17,760
Hardware infrastructure and then of

2509
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,920
course

2510
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:23,159
um also uh the the things where really

2511
01:53:23,159 --> 01:53:24,840
The Operators would would have a lot

2512
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,460
more experience which is what is the

2513
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:28,260
overall package that we need to build

2514
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,420
from that net so that this can be

2515
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:32,280
reasonably operationalized and sold

2516
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,860
right so we think we've seen in the last

2517
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:37,440
few years quite a few potentially really

2518
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,300
interesting uh high value applications

2519
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:41,280
that could make you know that net the

2520
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,040
new VPN services so to speak

2521
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,219
um at least them are not going to uh uh

2522
01:53:46,219 --> 01:53:49,679
enumerate them all but uh then uh the

2523
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:51,119
question is always what's the complete

2524
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:52,739
ecosystem what are the kind of first

2525
01:53:52,739 --> 01:53:56,219
services that the U.S operators feel uh

2526
01:53:56,219 --> 01:53:58,860
could uh help you to introduce a dead

2527
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:01,320
net hype services and then you know what

2528
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,119
are you missing to do that right and so

2529
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:04,980
that's basically the Outreach right come

2530
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:07,380
to that net the um

2531
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:09,719
problem statement the requirement draft

2532
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:12,000
that we have I think may be good part a

2533
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,040
good document to start revisiting and

2534
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,920
and add what's missing next slide

2535
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:20,219
so what we currently have is a key

2536
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:23,040
aspect such as reduction of the

2537
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,719
requirements for clock synchronization

2538
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:27,239
networks whether to reduce the cost or

2539
01:54:27,239 --> 01:54:28,980
completely eliminate that that's been

2540
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:31,260
one of the core problems that we've seen

2541
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:33,960
coming from the TSN side if you're in a

2542
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:35,940
in a Rand you'll see that you have a

2543
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:37,920
clock requirements in the front hall but

2544
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,480
luckily not in the back hole and

2545
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:42,000
expansion of that customers don't need

2546
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,280
support of course four wide area

2547
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:45,619
networks

2548
01:54:45,619 --> 01:54:49,260
with a large propagation of links that

2549
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:51,239
is not supported by the current uh

2550
01:54:51,239 --> 01:54:53,159
queuing mechanisms then of course the

2551
01:54:53,159 --> 01:54:55,500
overall cost of doing things in the 400

2552
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,659
gigabit router as opposed to 10 gigabit

2553
01:54:57,659 --> 01:55:00,480
campus router large number of flows

2554
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,100
because you have many customers the

2555
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:04,199
aggregation needed for that

2556
01:55:04,199 --> 01:55:06,600
um and then of course also the operation

2557
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,880
of a large Network which has a lot more

2558
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:11,460
failures interruptions recoveries also

2559
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:14,580
how to keep the service easily running

2560
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:16,260
across those

2561
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:18,659
um then at the core of the latency the

2562
01:55:18,659 --> 01:55:20,280
better scalable cheaper to implement

2563
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,860
queuing mechanisms and the explicit path

2564
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:25,260
selection where we have of course now

2565
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:28,080
since quite a while the segment routing

2566
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,960
architecture with mpls or isrv6 is one

2567
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,699
of the preferred mechanisms to do that

2568
01:55:32,699 --> 01:55:36,300
in networks um that also given more view

2569
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:38,760
in that net so that that we can well

2570
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:40,320
support them and that list is even

2571
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,880
incomplete

2572
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:42,659
um

2573
01:55:42,659 --> 01:55:44,340
and uh

2574
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,440
yeah so I think we would really love to

2575
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,960
see you know also an ability to

2576
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,119
prioritize these things based on what

2577
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,920
takes the longest to get done in terms

2578
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,480
of you know anything that requires new

2579
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,639
hardware I'd like to if you know know

2580
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:59,400
that early on whereas everything that

2581
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,139
we're missing in Yang models to

2582
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:03,060
operationally organize things may be the

2583
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,580
most important to you but given how you

2584
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,080
know we may have the hardware dependency

2585
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,739
first we can always uh you know do that

2586
01:56:09,739 --> 01:56:12,780
more timely then right so that's a

2587
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,880
little bit kind of um my overview on

2588
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,739
that next slide

2589
01:56:16,739 --> 01:56:19,020
yep and so that's what I was was here

2590
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:21,000
for right so if if you're if you're

2591
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,100
thinking there could be as an operator

2592
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:25,980
of uh especially large-scale network uh

2593
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,420
interest for you and that net again

2594
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:29,580
given that we have uh achieved you know

2595
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:31,619
a good round one and are now looking for

2596
01:56:31,619 --> 01:56:33,840
things more for your type of networks

2597
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,119
please come to that word uh contact the

2598
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:38,699
authors or the net mailing list so I'd

2599
01:56:38,699 --> 01:56:40,880
be really happy to see uh you know

2600
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,980
reinvigorated uh participation from new

2601
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:47,000
folks here thank you

2602
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:50,060
great

2603
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:52,139
I'm just going to say thank you very

2604
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:53,400
much for coming and presenting

2605
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,800
appreciated

2606
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,679
and we have about four minutes left

2607
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,659
which I guess is the

2608
01:57:00,659 --> 01:57:03,480
Ops area open mic session

2609
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:06,000
um if anybody has any

2610
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,940
UPS area open mic question statements

2611
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,159
you wish to throw tomatoes and rocks at

2612
01:57:11,159 --> 01:57:14,480
us please do so now

2613
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:18,960
no tomatoes

2614
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:22,080
fruits and vegetables

2615
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,060
okay well

2616
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:26,159
um thank you everyone very much again

2617
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:28,679
also another reminder please join the

2618
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:31,139
Ops directorate it's actually quite

2619
01:57:31,139 --> 01:57:33,239
interesting and Incredibly helpful and

2620
