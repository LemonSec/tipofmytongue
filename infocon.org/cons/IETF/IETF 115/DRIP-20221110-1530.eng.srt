1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,860
foreign

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,660
foreign

3
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,680
I guess that we can we can start

4
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,360
okay

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,620
so

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,020
hi everyone

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,739
um so this is the drip working group

8
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,360
um that

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,160
um

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,879
I'm chairing with Med

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,100
um

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,680
if you haven't seen the note well since

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,200
the beginning of the ITF I would be a

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,840
little bit surprised but

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,119
it's part of the rules so if you have

16
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,100
any questions

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,340
um just come back to the chairs or any

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,180
person from any chairs or any AD and it

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,680
will be happy to respond to your

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,979
question

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
um so

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,140
I guess you know the rules but um so if

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,080
you're using um I mean we we ask you

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,860
to use um mitiko to go into the line

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,340
uh even though you're in person

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,680
um so you have to click

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,500
to to go into the queue of the meteco so

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,540
that everyone knows who you are who is

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,720
speaking who is asking a question

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,560
um usually we ask you not to

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,280
use the video but um if you I mean if

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,500
you're speaking not on site remotely

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,119
then

34
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,399
um you you can use the video otherwise

35
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,380
if you don't speak make sure the audio

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,519
is mute

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,500
um if you want to speak and it's really

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,140
recommended that you have some

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,060
headsets

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,700
um that's going to make your um

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,700
I mean your words more comprehensible

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,360
um

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,379
for everyone

44
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,860
so this is the current agenda for today

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,520
um

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,420
so we have a little bit of a I mean this

47
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,180
is the introduction and um

48
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,340
then we have some administrative here

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,060
which is um how we liaise with um other

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,180
organizations to get some um Sam cut

51
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,739
points

52
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,300
um

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,879
I guess Stu is probably going to clarify

54
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,340
that for us

55
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,080
um

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,040
then we have a some um some active duck

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,739
around the working group is focused on

58
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,500
now and just for a reminder

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,780
um the one we're putting all our effort

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,319
is the authentication draft

61
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,640
um and then

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,220
um we have the Registries so these two

63
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,560
are um

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,060
I mean the main focus of the working

65
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,540
group then we will have um a point from

66
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,580
Andre on um

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,920
what are the implementation the current

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,840
implementation

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,900
um so Andrea and Adam

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,480
and then um closing uh we will close

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,580
that session with um anything you want

72
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,140
to say

73
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,620
um is there anything that anyone willing

74
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,140
to raise anything regarding this agenda

75
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,540
so document status

76
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,019
um we have two documents that are at the

77
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,319
ASG we're basically waiting for the

78
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,019
authentication draft

79
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,200
um to be completed so that we we assure

80
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,420
the three drafts are equivalent between

81
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,140
each others

82
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,380
um we expect that to be done

83
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,199
relatively soon so yeah just then you're

84
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,180
just in the previous slide please if you

85
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,060
can just yeah so uh

86
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,520
as as mission is flies so we have the um

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,440
there was a lot of work which was done

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,960
for the the drip architecture and the

89
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,000
the read specifications so there's a lot

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,740
of discusses that we received during the

91
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,240
Azure review that were that were

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,759
resolved and as an outcome of that of

93
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,720
the discussion there's another

94
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,300
individual draft that was edited in the

95
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,780
APC the work group and it is now it is

96
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,600
sponsored by Roman so Bob if you can

97
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
just give us an update of the the other

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,100
draft which is a sponsored by Roman do

99
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,840
you think that's this will be progressed

100
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,580
along the uh the read

101
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,060
Bob

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,660
yeah okay so that one is is there so for

103
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,180
the authentication so this is not

104
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,040
mentioned in the slide so this is the

105
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,660
second working of last call we have for

106
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,880
this for this document we used to have

107
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,259
the first one where you see the fair

108
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,880
amount of comments

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,680
um there was some commitment during the

110
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,720
the previous ATF meeting for people to

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
review and we didn't receive the four

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,340
people that committed to to do that but

113
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,380
received at least if I remember two or

114
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,820
three of them

115
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,979
um and then we launched the second

116
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,020
working class call there was Major

117
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,360
modification in the specifications we

118
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
hope to see more eyes on this document

119
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,639
uh so far we only have the the working

120
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,380
of chairs who will review the document

121
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,360
and we are doing this as a courtesy for

122
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,759
the work group but we would love to see

123
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,400
more eyes on this one so please even if

124
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,740
it's the working op is closed there is

125
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,440
time so that you can share your comments

126
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,539
on this one before we decide to send it

127
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,560
to uh to to our Ed so there is we also

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,660
requested the the early their expert

129
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,460
review views two of them are really

130
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,139
positive the one about the gene art and

131
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,060
the security

132
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,820
directorate the one I was hoping to see

133
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,440
was from the operational directory

134
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,820
because there's a lot of aspect there

135
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,320
about the provisioning which are

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,419
important we didn't receive any news

137
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,120
from them we really contacted them so

138
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
that we can send us the review but we

139
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,139
didn't hear from them so

140
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,319
um please get into this document and

141
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,180
share with us in the commentary app so

142
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,080
Daniel peace

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,699
okay so do you do we want to make a call

144
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,380
of people committing to review

145
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
I think that's the idea no need to to

146
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,039
have commitment for this one but I think

147
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
that the message is shared so let's

148
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
let's hope to see some more yeah

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,780
okay right so these are the miners the

150
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,460
milestones

151
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,220
so

152
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,220
um

153
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,160
so the authentication

154
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,120
um

155
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,120
is sent to the IHG two months ago so

156
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
we're I mean uh we we need to

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,060
to make sure that um it happens by the

158
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,220
end of the year

159
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,500
um so this is why it is important that

160
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,259
we get some additional reviews so we we

161
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,300
confident we we're going to reach that

162
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,800
goal

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,900
um and same for Registries

164
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,699
um

165
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,280
um we would like that to be sent by the

166
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,960
end of the year

167
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,080
um I guess we will have some ad words

168
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,060
but um

169
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,780
um

170
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,740
well the idea is basically that um

171
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,860
all the Don all the work is we will be

172
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,160
done by the next ITF that's um we don't

173
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,160
want to meet for the next ITF

174
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,660
um I think that should be the message

175
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,240
um but uh now I'm maybe giving the floor

176
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,080
to Eric

177
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,599
yeah so everything the responsibility

178
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,880
for this just wanted to say a few words

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,680
in addition to the image sent by the

180
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,720
chairs of end of September

181
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,479
as you know the Arc in Rhythm are

182
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,400
approved from calculation for changing

183
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,699
and going through everything I know

184
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,620
addressing this case takes time thank

185
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,840
you on this

186
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,300
I am waiting like we said that the old

187
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,340
progress to be sure that they're all in

188
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,620
saying because we need to be coherent so

189
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,860
good news for the arch I will request

190
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,580
another iitf-wide last call because

191
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,440
there's been two important change to it

192
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,200
that are not editorial right in section

193
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,820
402 3 there's been added blockchain in

194
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,040
addition to DNS so which is a major

195
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,940
change

196
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,800
and the other one another major change

197
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,420
was replacing DNS over TLS which

198
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,959
provides only privacy by DNS SEC that

199
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,600
provides authenticity and integrity

200
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,700
right so that's major change

201
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,440
so we request another Last Call on this

202
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
I don't expect anything bad

203
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,940
for read by the way I would need to send

204
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,500
an email on the mailing list because I

205
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,660
saw that in Section 5 when we do the

206
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,000
reverse DNS the canonical format is not

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
used so two IPv6 addresses or it can end

208
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,279
up in the same name which is of course

209
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,080
not really what we want anyway detail

210
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,880
um and I think we will talk and get some

211
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,220
news about the code points that I owed

212
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,420
right

213
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,459
I'm not sure we can go and progress to

214
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,560
the IG without those code points

215
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,140
and we may need to do some document

216
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,899
surgery or whatever

217
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,700
um I'm there to help but I'm kind of

218
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,120
helpless though on this one yeah

219
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,820
Eric about the um the

220
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,160
the last call that you plan to to issue

221
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,180
for the

222
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,459
um for the arch when do you think that

223
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,360
that's

224
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,880
um that will happen oh it will I mean it

225
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,200
will happen

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,300
whatever happens to oldness if all

227
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,760
progress right within one month or two

228
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,019
months I will shift together because

229
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,580
it's easier for the people doing the

230
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,040
review right getting the edge simply for

231
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
this for for their Leisure let's say for

232
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,440
their comfort

233
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,380
if nothing moves on old and right

234
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,180
which I think is a bad scenario I will

235
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,240
move those two forwards oh then and wait

236
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,779
thank you

237
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,160
okay so um

238
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,300
this slide is a focus on the Registries

239
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,820
so as you know there is a proposal to um

240
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,740
to split the the content of the current

241
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,899
Registries we have into various spaces

242
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,360
so that people can easily digest and

243
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
also grasp the uh the specification it

244
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,440
is really I would say for me it's a good

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,420
risk fraction of the content is really

246
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,360
more important for I would say uh to

247
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,700
structure this aspect but it is up to

248
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,140
the working to decide whether we

249
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,940
maintain the current structure or we go

250
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,399
to this account proposal if we go for

251
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,160
the split there is the um

252
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,019
um I would say two questions arise there

253
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,000
is that we need to make sure that we

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,860
will put in this document are fully

255
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,980
aligned with our drip Arch document and

256
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,600
this is something that I think it is it

257
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,779
is today but uh the editors need to to

258
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,220
be aware about about this and not

259
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,839
deviate from what we have at least agree

260
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,180
so far and the other point that we'll

261
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,500
discuss also during this lot of

262
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,779
registration is we need to decide where

263
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,700
to uh to send the other documents

264
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,980
because they don't believe to belong to

265
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,920
to the drip working group so there is

266
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,600
some I would say some Logistics to be to

267
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,100
be figured out and you will discuss that

268
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,680
during the Adam's laws there's a third

269
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,140
point which is really procedural but we

270
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,000
will depend on the you will need an

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,640
approval from Eric is to uh to change

272
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,220
the the status track of the registration

273
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,620
from proposed standard into

274
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,420
informational but this is something that

275
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,940
we can we can discuss

276
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,360
Daniel

277
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,560
okay

278
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,579
um so a steam I I can contact so we send

279
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,079
an email

280
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,800
um and um to contact us uh

281
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,019
um organizations

282
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,600
um but I think um

283
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,800
um Adam or Stu did some follow-up so

284
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
um

285
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,060
I I think I think it might it might

286
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,260
clarify

287
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,480
Where We Are

288
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,500
and

289
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,440
um and uh what are the next step to to

290
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,700
be done

291
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,820
um

292
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,899
foreign

293
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,980
okay

294
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,480
so

295
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,540
um

296
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,420
so I'm basically going to talk about

297
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,760
things external to ietf that drive or

298
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,560
otherwise interact with our work

299
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,500
so so I don't have the slides for

300
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,060
um

301
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,060
for um ASTM did you have some specific

302
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,320
ones

303
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,839
yeah I I had just like three slides

304
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,560
which I um um had uploaded and I think

305
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,380
Med has approved them yes so if you can

306
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,540
uh pull them from the data tracker or

307
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,040
whatever

308
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,779
okay

309
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,019
because I have the implementation I have

310
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,079
there's one called externality

311
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,959
no I don't I can't see those

312
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,018
um

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,260
um well I'll start talking while he

314
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,220
looks

315
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,420
um yeah

316
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,120
so I'm gonna grab my own laptop as notes

317
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
okay so there's um essentially uh three

318
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,120
externalities there are uh what are The

319
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,980
Regulators you're up to and what are the

320
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,000
other standards development

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,300
organizations up to and uh uh what are

322
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,920
the early adopters doing

323
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,660
so we've had

324
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,000
um several interactions between the

325
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,220
regulators and the external standards

326
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,480
development organizations that have

327
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,959
affected drip since IHF 114. in July

328
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,899
ASTM published

329
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,120
f-3411-22a it explicitly acknowledges

330
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,459
drip in the section that talks about

331
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,800
session IDs there used to there used to

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
be three types of IDs now there's four

333
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
the fourth type is called a specific

334
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,000
session ID it has two sub types subtype

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
one is listed as the ietf Drone remote

336
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,019
identification protocol identifier

337
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,839
and f-3586 means of Compliance Document

338
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,899
was submitted by ASTM to FAA So This

339
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,120
only affects the United States but it

340
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,480
describes how uh

341
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,579
f-3411-22a can be used to satisfy the

342
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,339
FAA regulations

343
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,779
um and that was

344
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,420
um mostly approved by the FAA but they

345
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,440
added a couple of additional

346
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,420
requirements

347
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,720
um in August the FAA said yeah we like

348
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,940
that means of compliance but um you need

349
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,100
to have tamper resistance and there's a

350
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,420
lot of um pain uh surrounding that one

351
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,639
um the reason being how do you do tamper

352
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,779
resistance with something that can be

353
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,899
sold profitably for 49 at Walmart

354
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,940
um in September uh unmanned aircraft

355
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,680
system manufacturers began filing

356
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,220
Declarations of compliance based upon uh

357
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,620
that means the compliance standard and

358
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,500
the notice of availability thereof I

359
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,480
filed a comment now I normally don't use

360
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,820
the first person singular pronoun in a

361
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,560
context like this but I made it very

362
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,920
clear that I was speaking for Stu card

363
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,260
but informed by work with my employer

364
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,139
ietf drip the Air Force blah blah blah

365
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,440
um and uh pointed out that if you run

366
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,260
the drip extensions to ASTM f-3411

367
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,180
you're going to have a private key store

368
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,680
on board the aircraft and if you have

369
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,300
tamper reactive Hardware you can simply

370
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,980
wipe that and that will achieve the

371
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,440
faa's purpose more effectively and at a

372
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,000
lower cost than putting the thing in a

373
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
titanium can

374
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,160
also in October

375
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,600
representatives of the FAA

376
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,940
agreed with the need for authentication

377
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,880
which goes beyond f-3411 requires you

378
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,500
know what we're doing in drip or or what

379
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,660
the IEEE is doing is the other specific

380
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,060
session ID subtype

381
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,640
um and they unofficially expressed their

382
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,679
appreciation of what we're doing uh in

383
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,559
drip drip really needs participation

384
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,119
from folks outside the United States and

385
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,500
notice the whole first half of this

386
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,419
slide is what's going on with the FAA

387
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,099
and many of you

388
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,959
shouldn't care what's going on with the

389
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,419
FAA so we really need some help from

390
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,839
from uh you folks outside the U.S

391
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,359
um we're going to need probably a means

392
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,860
of compliance

393
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,620
um addendum or something like that

394
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,020
showing how to use drip in addition to

395
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,860
ASTM f-3411 to more fully satisfy the

396
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,660
requirements because as I mentioned when

397
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,360
the FAA said yeah we like the ASTM thing

398
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,160
it was with a yeah but you have to do

399
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
these additional things

400
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
um presumably our basic drip document

401
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,100
set consisting of requirements uh

402
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,919
architecture the identifier which is

403
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,799
Bob's riddraft the authentication

404
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,900
formats and protocols which is atoms

405
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,240
major draft and at least the

406
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
architecture of the Registries if we go

407
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
ahead with that that restructuring

408
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,679
interestingly there are folks with

409
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,080
really urgent needs for remote ID and so

410
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,600
before we have FAA or any other caa's

411
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,960
blessing of any rfcs or indeed any rfcs

412
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,460
actually beyond the requirements which

413
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,539
is the only one that's been published so

414
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,620
far

415
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,179
um dtn working group is considering

416
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,600
whether our hips uh fit their node and

417
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,220
endpoint identify our needs for at least

418
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,919
some cases and some U.S agencies which I

419
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,419
am not at Liberty to name but they are

420
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,919
big ones with a lot of money and a lot

421
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,200
of aircraft are conducting field trials

422
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,940
that are intended to rapidly become

423
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,340
actual deployments of drip Daniel could

424
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,360
you put up the next slide please

425
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,840
okay how do these Drive our work well

426
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,179
the asdm document and the rules of the

427
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,820
different cias already drove our

428
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,220
requirements which drove our

429
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,039
architecture which is really closing in

430
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,440
on publication as an RFC which then

431
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,200
points to and introduces

432
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,940
um the identifier the authentication

433
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,640
formation protocols and whatever our

434
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,860
Registries document structure proves to

435
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,240
be and I'll leave that to Adam to talk

436
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,320
about next slide if you would please

437
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,220
Daniel

438
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,360
okay so um some other interactions

439
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,140
um

440
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,539
somebody in ITF I'm not sure who I'm not

441
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,240
sure whether it's ESG or IAB wants

442
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,640
points of contact from Iko and istm to

443
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,900
make sure that this whole thing isn't

444
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,960
just bobbing me ranting and

445
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,640
um they are willing in principle to you

446
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,200
know to provide those uh points of

447
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,520
contact

448
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,460
UM Iko wants what they call an observer

449
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,200
which is actually a full participant but

450
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,299
with no voting rights in their new trust

451
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,160
framework panel which is for all of

452
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,260
Aviation unmanned aircraft manned

453
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,419
aircraft Airline operation centers Air

454
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:46,860
Traffic Control Towers the whole nine

455
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,480
yards right

456
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,860
um they've already adopted the a variant

457
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,919
of the drip identity entity tag as one

458
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,500
of their identifier formats

459
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,900
um so Bob and Stu Bob and Stewart

460
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,580
already on the panel uh and the first

461
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,900
meeting will be in Montreal and we

462
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,539
really need somebody to represent ITF or

463
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,720
ITF drip not be Bob not me

464
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,760
um ASTM wants Iko to act as the

465
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,100
registrar for remote ID types and code

466
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,799
assignments fortunately our drip entity

467
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,840
ID is already burned right into the

468
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,000
standards document itself and it's been

469
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,620
said that when this registry is stood up

470
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,919
entry number one will be drip

471
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,720
um and then the specific authentication

472
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,120
methods there's going to be several

473
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,539
subtypes and we need at least three but

474
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,900
there's no process yet uh in place to to

475
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,760
register those

476
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,080
um each of these organizations has

477
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,640
procedures for establishing official

478
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,679
Liaisons but

479
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,380
um those procedures take time and we're

480
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,419
not so much trying to establish you know

481
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,220
ongoing broad organizational

482
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,780
relationships or trying to address the

483
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,020
specific issue of getting our Sam codes

484
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,240
and so ASTM has

485
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,919
um drafted a letter which is still in a

486
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,660
STM legal review that's going to go to

487
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,480
Iko to officially request that Iko be

488
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,820
the registrar for that Iko has

489
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,700
unofficially said yes already

490
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,820
um as soon as those documents are

491
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,620
mutually signed so that there is a

492
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,020
registrar we will immediately file our

493
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,299
registration paperwork with them

494
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,700
um we've had to identify

495
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,059
some informal interim points of contact

496
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:28,320
So Adam uh for drip because the

497
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,059
authentication draft is where those stem

498
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,280
codes get used

499
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,740
um Salo de Silva who's a very highly

500
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,400
placed individual at Iko headquarters

501
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,919
and uh Gabriel Cox who chaired the ASTM

502
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,240
working group that developed the remote

503
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,700
ID standard f-3411.

504
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,500
to identify an appropriate DNS Apex

505
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,600
we've been talking with the uh

506
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,000
appropriate people and to identify an

507
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,340
appropriate IP prefix we've been mostly

508
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,140
talking amongst ourselves but informed

509
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,179
by the um assignments that were

510
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,820
previously made for hip and hip B2 so

511
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,580
anyway um to summarize

512
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,760
um even though drip drafts are mostly

513
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,039
drafts and not yet rfcs we've already

514
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,120
got enormous momentum beyond the iatf I

515
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,460
mean there are people who are

516
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,020
sending these things into the field

517
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,460
based upon the drafts

518
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,059
did

519
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,000
for the equation yeah please yeah just

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,280
please stay there

521
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,260
for the first line right just to clarify

522
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,900
a little bit maybe a little bit fuzzy

523
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,840
there's yet in general the ieb is in

524
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,640
charge of all the liaison

525
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,919
right this is the thing and typically

526
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,100
the isg will require in the evaluation

527
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,159
that all those check has been done so

528
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,740
you get all the piece together

529
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,900
with somewhere we say it's formal yeah

530
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,000
we have a process but it's simply an

531
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,059
email in the case of the ATF IAB so

532
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,820
uh you can say hey Eric blah blah it is

533
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,460
enough right so very simple stuff yeah

534
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,919
right and and we do in fact have emails

535
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,380
from Salo de Silva saying yes I will

536
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,020
serve for now as the iko's point of

537
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,780
contact with ietf and we've got an email

538
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,419
from Gabriel Cox saying yes I will serve

539
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,780
as ASTM remote ID uh work Group contact

540
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,559
with iatf yeah just yep before can you

541
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,880
just please send it to the church

542
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,320
because we have contacted these people

543
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,179
and if you received any reply from them

544
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,460
so if you can just forward them that

545
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,720
would be really cool for we have a

546
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,460
record yeah I'll ping them again yeah

547
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,100
and also to to answer to the first point

548
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,799
you have in the slides it's us as a

549
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,720
chairs who try to to get this license

550
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
because we have a problem with the

551
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
authentication draft if we don't have

552
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
allocations we cannot send them to uh to

553
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,140
to Eric so that's a real problem in the

554
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,100
process if you want to have

555
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,980
interoperability and we need to fix this

556
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,380
anyway so Jim please yeah generally just

557
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,080
a random Bozo on this particular bus

558
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,340
um I think the points were made earlier

559
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,500
are quite valid too that we probably

560
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,480
don't need to have a formal liaison

561
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,700
relationship set up between the ITF and

562
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,280
these other organizations perhaps as you

563
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,020
say a non-voting subject matter next but

564
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,659
see a designated ITF expert to

565
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,280
potentially serve nuts committee and I

566
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,960
think something as simple as Eric

567
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,940
appointee or stuck key with probably the

568
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,860
best mechanism for that and let's not

569
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,320
get too tied down ideas setting up a

570
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,299
formal reason channel that might be

571
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,620
something for further down the line if

572
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,640
there's going to be a long-term

573
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
relationship there thank you Jim Eric

574
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,380
Derek zinc again and

575
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,659
like you who to partially answer you but

576
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,760
you answer yourself to what you said so

577
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,440
we don't need there are two steps for

578
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,260
liaison liaison manager which is some

579
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,000
guy which is there for many years and

580
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,440
then don't see everything we have

581
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,380
different 3gpp I3 poly it's not the case

582
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,140
here I don't think so uh so since simply

583
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,120
liaison statements it's simply an email

584
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,280
that is kept forever in one specific

585
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,899
place in the web that's what

586
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,299
yeah I mean um I mean uh I don't think

587
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,299
we would have that discussion if

588
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:04,140
they would answer to our email

589
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,020
this is my view I mean we are not we're

590
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,140
not trying to build something heavy

591
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,559
um actually we just want to get yes we

592
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,360
agree on that

593
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,480
yes we will have those count points but

594
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,740
currently

595
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,200
when we're trying to contact them

596
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,260
with an email we don't get any response

597
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,320
we haven't seen any response so

598
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,320
um well I really know

599
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,240
show this in the in the in the meeting

600
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,220
notes or anything but um one of those

601
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,679
guys had a very recent change of

602
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,260
employment which has

603
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,659
um muddled things a little bit and the

604
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,059
other one uh just defended his PhD which

605
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,860
has kept him rather busy but uh I'll

606
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,080
ping him again just one final point on

607
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,640
this to meet again

608
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,919
um whoever is going to serve not trusted

609
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,559
that that Fremont panel thing you were

610
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,240
talking about before this they will not

611
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,580
be speaking for the ITF or representing

612
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,500
the ITF they're just someone from the

613
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,840
ITF who can advise and give information

614
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,320
yeah just one final question before we

615
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,880
wrap up on this one you have mentioned

616
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,620
that the echo our client to answer to

617
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,840
the STM about their their plan to uh to

618
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,460
have their history do you have an idea

619
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,440
about this scheduling or just something

620
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,419
which well I told him I wanted it before

621
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,279
today and they said I'll hopefully get

622
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,980
it in December December

623
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,039
okay if it's December it's it's fine

624
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,658
okay thank you thank you still for

625
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,500

627
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,159
um

628
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,020
let me try to yeah

629
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,720
I already have slides Dan already up

thanks to Matt so you should be okay

631
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,159
all right so I'm going to attempt to

632
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,299
Blitz through

633
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,640
the small stuff and then we have

634
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,740
discussion where do I point this

635
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:07,980
here

636
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,460

637
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,340
I I click nothing happens it is sad okay

638
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,840
well I think Med did that

639
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,700
useless okay

640
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,740
um so just a quick update to touch back

641
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,960
on that ASTM and ik are working through

642
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,419
the process to set up the registry for

643
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,120
the uh code points for the Sam types the

644
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,760
formal letter is to be sent I contacted

645
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,940
Gabriel earlier in the week it's through

646
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,820
their legal processing so it will be

647
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,240
going out of ASTM soon to get to Iko

648
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,980
um once Iko gives the official

649
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,039
confirmation they should be ready and we

650
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,220
can just send the email through uh Eric

651
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,900
or Matt or Daniel to Iko requesting what

652
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,460
they need to be like are you going to

653
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,980
give us code points a simple yes and

654
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,659
then we can move forward

655
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:01,919
um and those are the four code points

656
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,080
we're looking for link wrapper manifest

657
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,779
and frame and the Stu said we at least

658
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,760
need the first three

659
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,440
um so on the working group last call for

660
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,820
authentication

661
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,340
um there was no substantive reviews

662
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,539
medheads put some issues on GitHub for

663
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,520
me so thanks Med I'm going to be working

664
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
on those at the end of this week

665
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,360
beginning of next week so there should

666
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,840
be a dash 27 pushed out hopefully by the

667
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,640
end of next week after I've recovered

668
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,779
from traveling from London uh next slide

669
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:31,980
all right so we're going to talk about

670
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,279
the hackathon very quickly next slide

671
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
um it was really successful

672
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,140
um I had a good discussion with the Liu

673
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,320
students from Andre they were all remote

674
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,779
we found some issues I did a very quick

675
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,960
just interrupt bash things seem to be

676
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,539
working just barring a few knits they're

677
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,039
going to be working on the changes

678
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,840
hopefully during the week so maybe Andre

679
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,419
will give some updates on that at the

680
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,299
end of the meeting we had two physical

681
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,740
attendees

682
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,500
um Philip and Marius they produced the

683
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,299
first open source implementation of

684
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,880
endorsements which is part of the

685
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,460
registry draft so and that will

686
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,740
hopefully end up on the working group

687
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,539
GitHub I'm gonna have to talk to Med

688
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,400
about how that's going to work but

689
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,279
there's a fork through there and that

690
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,899
will be lovely

691
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,640
um so thanks to both Philip and Marius

692
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,000
for their work uh Saturday and Sunday uh

693
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,100
we presented a hack demo happy hour and

694
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,620
showed it off and it was working with my

695
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,299
closed Source implementation

696
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,940
all right so right into the registries

697
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,159
you can just one two

698
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,919
next slide

699
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,159
okay so the current status was the

700
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,440
registry document has kind of sat since

701
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,120
114.

702
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,919
um I did I think a small update push

703
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,559
right at the end or right after but

704
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,539
there was the a general agreement of a

705
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,240
concept in 114 but it wasn't formal of

706
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,760
doing a split as we've been discussing

707
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,820
but a dry run was requested so I split

708
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,320
the documents through them in an email

709
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,480
threw them to the mailing list

710
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
nothing happened I think for like a

711
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,360
month I waited and then Bob said drafts

712
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,700
are free put them in the data tracker

713
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,919
under a personal draft so I threw them

714
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,240
in his personal drafts into the working

715
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,120
group uh there were no comments from

716
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
either set of pushes other than I think

717
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,640
Bob plus wanting it very early on

718
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,100
um the my live prototype is fast

719
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,220
tracking these documents it's live in on

720
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,080
the Internet it's using DNS it's doing

721
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
all of its good things so I want to

722
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,460
focus today solely on the discussion of

723
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,159
this you know splitting of the documents

724
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,159
and get consensus now

725
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,600
um next slide

726
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,299
so this image is probably familiar to

727
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,240
you from 114 it's a bit parsed down and

728
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,779
not as wordy uh and has color this time

729
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,720
um so this is the general architecture

730
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,840
the detm architecture and each one of

731
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,779
those arrows represents a draft that is

732
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,220
currently pushed there are five

733
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,080
documents the denim architecture the DPA

734
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,720
HTTP document the registry HTTP document

735
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,360
the registry Epp document and the DIA

736
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,240
rdap document and you can see on this

737
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,460
image where they're located in the whole

738
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,760
architecture stack next slide

739
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,860
so the datum Arch is the primary

740
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,380
document that's going to I think affect

741
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,580
the working group

742
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,820
it replaces the registry document that

743
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,799
we have now it becomes goes from

744
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,380
standard to informational maybe I'm not

745
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,880
quite sure we're gonna have to talk to

746
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,100
Eric and get working group consensus on

747
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,320
it but it's the primary architecture for

748
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,140
the registration and lookup it rips all

749
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,820
of the implementation details out and

750
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,799
says these are in other drafts we just

751
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,120
talk high level models roles components

752
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,080
for the system that is it

753
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
um next slide

754
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,399
uh as I said it's a copy of the

755
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,960
Registries document with the following

756
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,299
changes the terminology I can confirm

757
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,159
lines up with the current version of

758
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,380
architecture it happened at the end of

759
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,260
work 14. I made sure that everything was

760
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,779
lined up if it isn't lined up it's maybe

761
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,299
one word here one word there that just

762
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,559
missed a control uh find replace if

763
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,299
that's what I did

764
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,740
um there were some additional sections

765
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,720
explaining the logical components added

766
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,179
I updated the attestation to endorsement

767
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,279
again uh the changes uh for

768
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,659
definitions it's also been moved to the

769
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:37,860
main body

770
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,840
implementation details have been ripped

771
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,480
out we may need to tweak text here and

772
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,760
there that might be broken based on that

773
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,039
but for the most part it read fairly

774
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,559
cleanly at least to me

775
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,299
um and then there was a new Ayana

776
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:54,120
registry put in for some value stuff for

777
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,059
registration data per um some comments

778
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,559
from Stu

779
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,940
now

780
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,039
overall this makes it easier to parse

781
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,520
and modulize as Med said earlier so I as

782
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,159
the author and I believe the editor of

783
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,320
the document believe that this is a

784
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,380
great move because it was a hard time in

785
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,260
114 of the guys from info networks it

786
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,059
was so much

787
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,279
it was a fire hose to them and they just

788
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,799
couldn't grok anything and it took hours

789
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,960
and hours and hours to get them up to

790
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,919
speed

791
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,059
and that was just horrible so hopefully

792
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,480
this fixes a lot of the problems uh

793
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,600
let's go to the next slide

794
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,539
so this is the next biggest important

795
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,279
draft that probably stays in the working

796
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,880
group it's the uh drip provisioning

797
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,820
agent uh document and it's the if we

798
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,740
looked back at the previous diagram

799
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,299
which you don't have to go back to we

800
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,100
might go back to later it was the red

801
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,559
arrow and this is just the interface

802
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,760
between clients and the dime

803
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,399
inputs the formatting all that good

804
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,659
stuff

805
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,159
um I hope that this working group

806
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,580
document gets adopted or the document

807
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,219
gets adopted by the working group but if

808
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,560
we have to focus on datum alone that's

809
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,960
fine next slide

810
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,659
same thing with the DIA HTTP this is

811
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,000
another document that defines a

812
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,780
interface for the rdds

813
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,239
it's currently HTTP based it could be

814
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,139
else other things that may depend on DNS

815
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,179
Technologies and where exactly we're

816
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,179
deploying again another document that I

817
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,859
hope would be adopted because it's I

818
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,219
think a core but it isn't the pressing

819
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,480
issue the pressing issue is the

820
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,119
architecture uh next slide

821
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,219
finally the documents to move to the

822
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,239
working group these are the ones that

823
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,699
I'm not really sure where they go uh the

824
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:54,599
registry to http Dia rdap and registry

825
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,500
Epp they seem to be better suited into

826
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,580
the registry extension working group

827
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,680
but it's an argument of do we give it to

828
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,740
them and they work on it and I travel

829
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,900
with the documents to give guidance for

830
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,579
the use case and they are the primary

831
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,980
authors or we leave them here

832
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,680
and bring primary authors to here I'm

833
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,800
not quite sure how this is handled and

834
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,660
where the work lives so we're probably

835
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,200
have to discuss this uh next slide

836
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,700
all right so these are just some open

837
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,460
issues that are left the apex of the DNS

838
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,820
tree as Stu pointed out encryption key

839
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,920
management which is kind of a stretch

840
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,359
goal in a way it ties into Bob's

841
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:41,640
uh personal draft on operator privacy

842
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,720
which privacy which has expired but I

843
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,300
know based on my work that's the next

844
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,859
big item I have to work on

845
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,140
implementation wise

846
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,640
um serial numbers for non-drip

847
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,320
participants this is something that's

848
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,300
been knocked around by the authors a

849
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,579
little bit and then finally endorsement

850
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,180
just definitions uh they're in Json

851
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,520
right now which is terrible I'm going to

852
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,200
convert them to cddl so this is more

853
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,820
just an action item for me and to

854
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,940
remember uh next slide

855
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,420
okay so this is the discussion so those

856
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,099
are the big major questions do we

857
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,140
proceed with this restructure do we have

858
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,579
any problem with the names and the

859
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,000
Scopes what do how do we adopt denim

860
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,920
Arch if we're going to is it just a

861
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,260
rename of the Registries document is it

862
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,540
just a push of the Registries document

863
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,820
with the content completely changed I

864
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,720
don't know

865
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,599
personally I don't care as long as we

866
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,160
agree to what we want to do and what

867
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,140
makes it life easier for everyone and

868
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,359
then finally what documents stay

869
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,020
um

870
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,380
so I opened the floor to anyone and

871
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,599
everyone to give their opinions and

872
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,460
their input hopefully we can reach

873
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,200
consensus

874
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,819
by the end of the hour

875
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,839
Moskowitz Adam from the slides it's not

876
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,740
clear to me will you put the endorsement

877
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,140
evidence

878
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,540
um definitions the endorsement dividends

879
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,700
definitions are in the detm architecture

880
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,040
so the architecture document it is

881
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,619
Section 8 I believe of the personal

882
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:20,940
document

883
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,560
and that's where they're defined the

884
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,380
structures are defined and uh just

885
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,540
generally what goes in the evidence

886
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,200
what is goes in evidence is defined in

887
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,140
other documents the the actual formats

888
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,260
the formats though are defined in the

889
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,859
drip the datum architecture okay I may

890
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,020
have a little bit of a problem of how

891
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,880
much information is in the architecture

892
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,760
other than saying these things exist

893
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,560
but in terms of the definition of

894
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,500
content that may be problematic having

895
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,200
that in in architecture I'll have to

896
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,420
look and review it be careful here

897
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,339
because our because that may be getting

898
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,440
a little bit too much detail in

899
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,079
architecture so the only thing where

900
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,960
those where there's well-defined what's

901
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,839
in the evidence is the predefined

902
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,320
structures that we have selected

903
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,400
self-endorsements broadcast endorsements

904
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,740
concise endorsements that's the only

905
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,540
thing that's very specific in that

906
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,579
document but everything else gets kicked

907
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,680
out yeah defining what they are and why

908
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,020
they are belongs in in architecture and

909
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,359
that is there now okay defining their

910
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,520
Continental what's in them even

911
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,980
um just describing the elements all that

912
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,400
belongs elsewhere elsewhere okay that's

913
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,640
that's my view of it that's fine with me

914
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,260
as long as we find the home for the

915
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,640
pieces

916
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,579
yeah Jim Reed back again to claim I'm

917
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,020
just speaking for myself

918
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,060
in general I think this is a great step

919
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,400
forward and breaking down the existing

920
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,200
documents along the lines you suggested

921
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,540
Adam is a good idea it's much more

922
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,420
modular it's easier to understand and

923
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,920
it's easier to figure out how the bits

924
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,240
are going to try to fit together so I

925
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,800
think going down this way is probably

926
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,359
the right thing for the working group to

927
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,020
do

928
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,820
the other comment I had to do is about

929
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,060
the potential for an Epp extension I

930
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,740
think we would do should do this work

931
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,619
here because we'll be better placed to I

932
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,720
know what the requirements might be and

933
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,099
then eventually when we've got something

934
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,619
that's reasonably well baked chuck it

935
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,359
across the road to the to the regex

936
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
group to ask them for any final comments

937
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,140
but since all we're going to lightly be

938
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,180
doing is adding another piece of XML to

939
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,920
the schema I don't think it'll be a big

940
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,300
problem there

941
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,119
I figured as such but

942
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,880
floating the ideas up everything is the

943
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,339
ad uh I'm afraid they're really

944
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,680
paraphrase or repeat what Jim said

945
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,839
indeed it looks like it's better for

946
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,660
Martin easier to swallow so cool and for

947
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,900
the extension 2p spirit is only an XML

948
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,480
extension stayed here right the only

949
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,800
thing we will do the working group last

950
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,640
score forward it to the regex okay and I

951
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,619
think it's important because the

952
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,720
architecture document was well the

953
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
original registry document was so big so

954
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,660
convoluted that we had everyone me Bob

955
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,380
Stu everyone had a hard time

956
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,180
deconflating things we kept putting

957
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,740
things in buckets that we shouldn't have

958
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,079
and I think this will clear it so now

959
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,660
it's just like we thought oh Epp we have

960
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,180
to change everything now we can

961
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,119
yeah yeah the only point I would make as

962
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,280
a chair is that we cannot I would say

963
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,900
carry all these pieces in parallel

964
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,040
because of the limitation of the

965
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,980
resources we have so I

966
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,839
and I need to discuss this with Danielle

967
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,579
we are not planning to adopt any other

968
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:36,900
documents rather than the dim

969
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,820
architecture itself so that we can have

970
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,079
some negotiations really I would say

971
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,480
stable and then we if we have a

972
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,040
sufficient energy in the working group

973
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,900
to work in the other pieces we will not

974
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,200
kick them but not in parallel that is

975
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,839
find with me that's I have no issue with

976
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,720
that next hi uh ajbl Naval Postgraduate

977
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,560
School

978
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,480
um just kind of looking through the the

979
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,000
architecture and the mailing lists uh

980
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,560
repo that's there there's not really a

981
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,359
specification there is some RF link that

982
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,520
advertises this

983
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,380
um and I don't think it belongs in the

984
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,119
architecture to specify it but I was

985
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,359
wondering if the uh F you know the FCC

986
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,700
or equivalent International bodies have

987
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,000
said what RF frequency oh this would

988
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,640
advertise on Okay so

989
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,079
hahaha

990
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,579
Stu's laughing

991
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,560
um that is not defined here it is

992
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,680
defined in ASTM

993
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,500
oh yes FAA defined it and then ASTM used

994
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,820
it

995
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,420
yes that's true correct yeah so it's FAA

996
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,200
side FAA said it has to work on

997
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,359
why don't you answer that because I'm

998
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,400
going to fumble and just drown and it

999
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,099
will be sad

1000
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:49,859
right yeah well the architecture says

1001
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:51,300
someone on a cell phone picks it up

1002
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,220
that's a

1003
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,500
yeah uh where this came from is it the

1004
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,780
faa's aviation rulemaking committee

1005
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,119
strongly recommended and the FAA adopted

1006
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,800
that

1007
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,740
um any media to be used for this should

1008
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,980
be license free media that are readily

1009
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,300
available to any citizen ASTM then said

1010
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,780
that means Bluetooth 4 Bluetooth 5 Wi-Fi

1011
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,720
neighbor awareness networking and 802.11

1012
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,500
Beacon and others as we may add later

1013
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,480
okay great thank you yeah if you want

1014
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,400
more context or whatever

1015
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,859
find the two of us and we will talk your

1016
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,880
ear off till the end of time

1017
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,280
oh boy

1018
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,040
alcohol just make it slurred and nasty

1019
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,400
okay so we kind of look up okay so

1020
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,320
unless there is any objection we can we

1021
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,720
will proceed with it with this plan so

1022
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,040
yeah it is time to speak

1023
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,859
once again okay

1024
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:55,740
thank you thank you all right uh I will

1025
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,440
get with the two of the uh uh Eric and

1026
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,300
Matt I will get with you directly after

1027
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,880
this let me know what I need to do well

1028
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,040
if I have to submit what whatever you

1029
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,079
want let me know and I will push it

1030
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,480
through probably either later tonight or

1031
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,940
Friday so that it's done before we even

1032
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,339
leave London okay thank you thank you

1033
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:17,960
thank you all right thank you guys

1034
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,680
Andre you're next

1035
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,020
can you hear me yes love don't care

1036
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,160
good

1037
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,940
um

1038
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,339
so I'm happy to present uh experiment

1039
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,619
update on behalf of

1040
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,960
myself and our students at Lynn Champion

1041
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,980
University Sweden next slide please

1042
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,380
we have implemented this reference

1043
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,900
architecture which is partly compatible

1044
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,180
with what rippers doing at the moment in

1045
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,420
terms of broadcasting messages from the

1046
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,040
Drone and receiving it at the

1047
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,680
application and we also have alternative

1048
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,079
implementation of registry now which is

1049
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,660
based on blockchain which might be

1050
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,700
something interesting for working group

1051
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,099
in future if you have energy to

1052
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,859
specified and maybe put it in separate

1053
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,060
draft

1054
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,380
but next please

1055
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,200
so as Adam mentioned we had very nice

1056
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,119
preparation for this IDF in terms of

1057
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,400
testing our mutual implementations our

1058
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,099
open source Adams's proprietary

1059
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,819
so we had also some success in hackathon

1060
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,819
in the in the Sunday to to identify some

1061
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:37,380
issues between our

1062
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,760
different implementations in our Android

1063
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,020
phone and also in the drip broadcast so

1064
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,819
mostly they are compatible but we

1065
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,740
identified some issues which are now

1066
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,200
being resolved so I think it was very

1067
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,599
nice and thanks Adam for for joining by

1068
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,160
the hackathon

1069
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,000
next please

1070
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,640
um as you know Bluetooth 4 is currently

1071
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,400
mostly used but it has limited range so

1072
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,119
and Bluetooth 5 can provide reception up

1073
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,520
to like one kilometer from from a flying

1074
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,180
drone so it's we are working on

1075
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,640
also adding both to five support which

1076
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,619
is a bit challenging in Raspberry Pi 4

1077
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,960
because some drivers are not so up to

1078
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,619
date

1079
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,619
so we also tried some external dongles

1080
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:29,819
that we can connect and then uh try to

1081
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,700
to add this support and also in

1082
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,099
Bluetooth 5 in so-called new unit of

1083
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,560
computing which is Intel which we

1084
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,079
already like operating and testing but

1085
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,660
Raspberry Pi is still in in progress

1086
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,618
next please

1087
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,260
and our application for for Android for

1088
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,099
receiving direct data is uh in progress

1089
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:54,300
also

1090
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,880
uh so we used open drone ideas as a

1091
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,160
starting point but the problem it was

1092
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,500
requiring Google API key which is

1093
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,020
requiring credit card and so on so we

1094
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,300
could not really publish ready packages

1095
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,119
but now we switch to open street maps

1096
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,960
version which is free so now we have on

1097
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,079
the trip application page we have ready

1098
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,240
APK and also we are in progress to

1099
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,280
Publishers

1100
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,200
Google Play app which unfortunately

1101
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,359
requires a lot of questions and answers

1102
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:27,420
and and still in progress but we hope to

1103
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,940
finish it within a few days

1104
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,599
next

1105
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,020
next slide please

1106
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,240
um so Hardware we use the

1107
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,880
Phantom 4 drone as a starting point with

1108
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,300
Raspberry Pi 4 and then this battery on

1109
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,260
the left side as well as GPS receiver

1110
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,440
so we just put it all together

1111
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,240
um and then

1112
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,520
as always when you start doing things in

1113
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,140
recover some funny stuff like for

1114
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,680
example the

1115
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,599
antenna was completely messing up the

1116
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,400
Drone system so we had to actually

1117
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,220
remove it but um

1118
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:08,880
um

1119
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,980
if you put the next slide

1120
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,359
we actually got it flying as you see on

1121
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,480
the left the Phantom drone in in a bag

1122
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,700
carrying the complete drip operational

1123
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,599
transmitter which has a GPS support and

1124
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,420
Bluetooth 4 and Wi-Fi

1125
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,359
and as you see on the application you

1126
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,119
can get the data about

1127
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,440
host identity tag of a drone and also

1128
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,819
the coordinates

1129
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:42,420
and on the right side you can see our

1130
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,900
back end which is a again not compatible

1131
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,660
with current registry draft but it's

1132
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,240
like what we produced so it's some kind

1133
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,720
of registry where you you can register

1134
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,859
your drone ID if the public key and so

1135
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:02,579
on which can be used like uh remote for

1136
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,680
remote queries

1137
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,260
see like what is the public key of a

1138
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,660
drone and then verify the

1139
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,099
a veteran identity and actually it's

1140
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,680
Backward Compatible with current

1141
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,540
standard which is not secure prone ID

1142
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,520
because

1143
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,380
it's uh kind of based on it

1144
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,160
text please

1145
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:29,099
um our next experiment uh

1146
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,339
area was using this so-called new unit

1147
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,579
of computing which is basically a normal

1148
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,260
PC but it's like small factor and it's 8

1149
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,480
86 architecture which makes it a bit

1150
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,900
easier because Raspberry Pi is Arm based

1151
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,720
so it's easier to get like more

1152
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,380
up-to-date drivers on this um uh this

1153
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,940
nuke device

1154
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,020
and as you see here on the Matrix

1155
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,400
digitron it actually integrates fully

1156
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,220
with a drone in terms of API so it gets

1157
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,359
a power from a drone GPS data and other

1158
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,359
stuff so it's a bit

1159
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,119
less Hardware let's say even than using

1160
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:15,119
Raspberry Pi on Phantom

1161
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,680
also has 5G modem on the top and nice

1162
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,359
thing about this nuke it has the

1163
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,339
Bluetooth four five five so we could

1164
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:26,520
hold a test that together

1165
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,160
next slide

1166
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,819
so we have this nice big public demo

1167
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:36,300
event in Sweden by valenberg Foundation

1168
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,819
where we could fly this drone and

1169
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:42,240
actually test the range of ID that we

1170
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,000
could think at that time we had only

1171
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,180
Bluetooth four variables so we could

1172
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,300
have less than 200 meters range but as I

1173
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,339
mentioned in other tests in Bluetooth 5

1174
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,680
we could have about a kilometer so which

1175
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,660
is much better

1176
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,079
and as well we

1177
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:05,160
um contributed to open Chrome ID patch

1178
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,700
developed by Intel to have GPS support

1179
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,579
for them and check that we are kind of

1180
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,740
Backward Compatible so that we can have

1181
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,540
both secure and

1182
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,780
insecure drone ID received on this on

1183
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,180
the same app and same same device

1184
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,599
so it's work working well

1185
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,500
excellent

1186
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,599
also we were analyzing this drip

1187
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,680
protocol with a tool called Tamarind or

1188
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,079
uh any errors in

1189
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,480
security specification

1190
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,780
and while in general we found that drip

1191
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,839
protocol is all secure except we

1192
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,059
identified some risk for replay attacks

1193
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:51,559
which we plan to communicate to draft

1194
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:54,240
coffers to see if there is anything that

1195
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,980
we need to fix

1196
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,859
but in general I guess it's a good

1197
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:01,559
sort of support for protocol going

1198
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,780
forward as we know with TLS latest

1199
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,900
version we had also full verification

1200
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,420
with turmering next please

1201
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,859
and as we know drip is using a host

1202
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:19,740
identity protocol for generating IDs and

1203
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,260
we are supporting open source

1204
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,599
implementation of it so there is a

1205
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:26,880
patches needed to implement latest draft

1206
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,380
such as hierarchical heat support

1207
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,500
new crypto like hudiak and so on and

1208
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,839
also we likely implemented Docker

1209
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,240
support so that it's easy to for example

1210
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,500
test on

1211
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,700
Mac device or any any other

1212
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,140
windows or device which doesn't have

1213
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,119
full Linux support so

1214
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,180
welcome to download it and try on your

1215
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,200
your own device next

1216
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,240
so one of the challenges we had is that

1217
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,180
uh now there is new openssl 3.0 and the

1218
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,720
old SSL free one one one is going to be

1219
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,579
duplicated in a year which was pretty

1220
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:09,720
big change

1221
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,680
in open Heap code so we have the to you

1222
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,040
know change many things and uh the

1223
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,720
current status is that the code is

1224
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,880
compiling but it's still pretty Alpha so

1225
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,480
it needs more testing and

1226
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,160
um more verification but since

1227
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,980
type of priority thing due to

1228
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,260
duplication I hope we'll

1229
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,140
get it get it done before before the new

1230
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,240
year and then

1231
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,420
they also like tested not traversal and

1232
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,359
and some other stuff

1233
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:48,780
which might be useful for drip as well

1234
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,240
so let's that's it if you have any

1235
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,460
questions comments we'll be happy to

1236
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,819
take it

1237
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,180
foreign

1238
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,780
I have one for you before to get to the

1239
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,940
mic yeah so

1240
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,440
you have mentioned for for the last one

1241
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,460
that there is something that's going to

1242
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,440
be I would say broken for that part is

1243
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,780
there something that can be I would say

1244
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,940
fixed or this is not something that you

1245
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,819
have you have in mind so far

1246
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:31,319
yeah

1247
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:34,319
well to to fix replay attacks you need

1248
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,900
some kind of freshness freshness and

1249
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,940
nonsense and

1250
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,880
well if uh if a drone just let's say

1251
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,420
broadcast hait it's a lot of you know

1252
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,640
hard to just record it and broadcast it

1253
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,460
somewhere else right so so you need some

1254
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,920
kind of maybe what

1255
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,760
query report protocol it's you know Adam

1256
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,339
had this picture in his slides about

1257
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:01,740
sending a message but nobody can reply

1258
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,839
to it right so it's okay

1259
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,040
same kind of thing

1260
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,520
are you yes

1261
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:21,119
yes Daniel we don't hear you

1262
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,740
Andre is still here

1263
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,720
um the formal analysis that you're

1264
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,500
undertaking is that on the protocol or

1265
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,819
on the implementation

1266
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:35,160
it's mostly on the protocol so we tried

1267
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,540
as you see in this picture to follow the

1268
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,099
protocol as close to as possible

1269
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:43,500
including all their drafts and the

1270
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,079
Registries and so on so it's

1271
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,400
in the protocol yes

1272
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,400
so I understand the replay attack

1273
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,520
being mostly ignorant to the use of

1274
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,819
broadcast

1275
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,670
[Music]

1276
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,900
yeah just because anybody can record

1277
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,640
HIV and property and then send it

1278
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,299
somewhere else right

1279
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,119
right but probably I'm up with my time

1280
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,079
so thanks

1281
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,880
thank you Andrew

1282
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,000
and still grew a really good gray bird

1283
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,339
for this idea

1284
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:37,819
thank you

1285
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,059
Andre

1286
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,599
so

1287
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,339
so now we are

1288
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:52,200
the last part of the open mic I don't

1289
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,339
know if you have any comments or any

1290
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,859
questions to uh to the chairs or do you

1291
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:58,200
the Ed or for the working Queen General

1292
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,279
you can get to the mic

1293
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,700
okay if there's no commentating that we

1294
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,140
can we can adjourn here so thank you

1295
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,760
thank you for attending and see you next

1296
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,020
time in the um next drape session and

1297
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,980
thank you all for your work

1298
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,399
foreign

1299
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,259
foreign

1300
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,780
it was kind of

1301
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,780
things
