um today's group is about

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,400
30-ish people it seems remote plus local

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,120
commands

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,000

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,880

um thank you so much for attending this

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,500
session uh the grow working group

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,540
concerns themselves with operations of

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,620
the global internet routing system

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,460
um and these days we also spent a lot of

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,180
time on BMP the bgp monitoring protocol

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,420
uh today's session will be uh mostly

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,899
split between focus on BMP and a novel

16
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,960
proposal uh about describing bgp

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,780
communities in a Json format

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,920
Chris

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,059

um

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,420
let's start with the first slide deck

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,799
would you mind pulling that up Chris

23
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,220
foreign

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,860
we had chair slides you want to cover

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,340
this first

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,860
please pay attention to the note well

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,479
the note will outlines expectations uh

28
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,479
about behaviors and processes

29
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,939
uh but I think by now at the end of the

30
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,000
week most of you have seen this slide

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,140
multiple times

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,979
next slide please

33

here's an overview of the resources

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,659
related to The Grow working group uh our

35
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,140
agenda is available online everybody

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,579
submitted their slide deck for today's

37
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,259
session

38
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,720
um and you can find those online

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,360
we have a mailing list that is open for

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,000
everybody to participate in if you're

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,280
interested in routing operations on a

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,280
global skill please consider subscribing

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,500
to our mailing list

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,459
next slide please

45
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
the blue sheets no longer is a sheet but

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,060
a QR codes the QR code was at the entry

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,379
point into this room make sure to scan

48
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,360
the QR code and log in with the data

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,680
tracker login this helps us with

50
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,000
planning the next session in terms of

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,540
room size

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,280
um minutes taker

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,440
we need somebody to uh keep notes of

54
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,260
what was said and processed in this

55
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,879
proceeding

56
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,280
is anybody willing to volunteer to be

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,480
our minute taker today

58
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,340
well if nobody is volunteering I

59
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,980

excellent news we have a minute taker

66
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,540
uh the jeopard stripes task is to keep

67
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,700
an eye out on the chat room and if

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,819
questions emerge

69
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,379
we try to make sure that they are

70
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,879
handles

71
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,120
oh it's it's zulip these days

72
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
um I'll keep an eye on on sulip

73
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,280
agenda bashing

74
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
um can we skip to the next slide for

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,319
that Gemma

76
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,080
uh we're gonna talk about documents in

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,180
Flight uh Paulo is going to give an

78
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,760
update on EMP tlv

79
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,880
um Ebates progress

80
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,440
we have an update on BMP High

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,540
availability data collection

82
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,180
uh and updates about the bgp young model

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,620
and finally uh BMP path marking is there

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,120
anything that should be added to this

85
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,580
agenda oh wait I see that Martin tells

86
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,840
us uh

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,720
item didn't make it into the slides our

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,900
last item is smart and Pals on a

89
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,479
mechanism to describe HP communities in

90
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
adjacent format

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,040
so I think with that we'll we'll need

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,500
roughly an hour

93
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,520
next slide please

94
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,680
all right

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,520
um

96
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
let's kick it off hello would you mind

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,500
stepping forward to the stage and uh

98
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,600
sharing with us your thoughts and

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
insights on that

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,060
the bmpe bits and tovs

101
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,060
okay

102
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,440
yes

103
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,400
all right

104
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,699
you want me to do it you got it thank

105
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,500
you

106
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,740
foreign

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,680
can you hear me yes

108
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,860
so um actually I have uh three items to

109
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,280
to talk about two are the

110
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,940
microphone

111
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,719
yes this

112
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,199
wow that close okay

113
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,900
fantastic really close

114
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,080
um so I have three items uh it's uh the

115
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,340
tlv the ebit plus this uh new brand new

116
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,500
idea that all of you is going to love

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,160
not like love so next slide please we

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,500
start with the tlv

119
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,180
um

120
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,820
next slide already because this is just

121
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,800
a problem statement you remember it from

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,100
from the past uh it's just to make sure

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,280
that there are tlbs in every uh BMP

124
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,800
message and we were missing that for

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,280
root monitoring and for uh peer down

126
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,319
um so what happened since uh version

127
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,440
seven we skyrocketed to version tank

128
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,800
first of all and there are there are

129
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,620
there has been a lot of minor fixes but

130
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,060
the two main things are uh first that

131
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,000
um so we are ex we are extending the

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,039
root monitoring message with the tlds

133
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,139
and I think in a protocol it's important

134
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,240
to be consistent to something else that

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,639
happens in the protocol so

136
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,699
um until the previous revision of the

137
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,600
draft we were being consistent to peer

138
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,020
up peer down uh to let's say init and

139
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,500
tournament messages but actually uh you

140
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,319
know that was a kind of a sub-optimal I

141
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,020
think Jeff was the very first to notice

142
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,120
that you know you have to parse the

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,520
whole pdu in order to skip then to the

144
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,280
tlbs and the tlvs they may convey in

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
some characteristic about the PDO so it

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
was like a not so nice and beautiful but

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
let's say overall we got through the

148
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,479
revisions with the you know comments

149
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,280
like the one of Jeff but saying okay

150
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,520
it's not nice but it's okay right

151
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,880
um I would say finally I did take this

152
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,800
decision that you know we should be

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,360
consistent to something let's be

154
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,940
consistent to the root root mirroring

155
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,419
message which is entirely TLD so now we

156
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,080
have a bgp message tlv and the pdu is

157
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,319
part of the bgp message TLP so now you

158
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
can do whatever you like you can

159
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,259
really put it this bgp message tlb you

160
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,000
can put last first you can sandwich

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,460
between other tlbs and things like that

162
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,340
I think it makes sense and it's much

163
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,759
more beautiful than before

164
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,599
and based on team events feedback uh on

165
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,639
the list

166
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,699
I did introduce the group TLD Group tlv

167
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,520
is because uh Team said like we can do

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,640
essentially want to we can model

169
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
one-to-one like

170
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,700
um

171
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,520
tlvs to angle arise we can do one to one

172
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,159
because there is the index 0 meaning it

173
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,560
applies to everything but then we can do

174
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,779
not do M twang right kind of

175
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,420
relationship so I said you know let's do

176
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,620
the group tlv and essentially we just uh

177
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,560
yeah and I don't know it it can get

178
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,600
complicated but

179
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,060
um it it is one of the way forward of

180
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,459
course on all of this I very deeply

181
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,440
appreciate your feedback if you have any

182
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,760
next slide

183
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,420
right and um what is the status I would

184
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,660
say that the status is simply that there

185
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,360
is a little bit more feedback from Tim

186
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,060
Evans that I have to process actually I

187
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,279
am in weight instead I mean waiting for

188
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,279
some answers from him on the list

189
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,260
um and I would say like

190
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,140
um uh yeah I this is the status and

191
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,360
probably there will be more changes uh

192
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,660
coming up in the next uh

193
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,060
um version of the draft so this is it

194
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,060
for the tlb draft I don't know if uh

195
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,220
there is any comments if you want to

196
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,740
make them now

197
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,940
nothing

198
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,740
share

199
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,080
remote chair

200
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,580
no

201
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,540
all right next slide

202
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,860
so this is about the ebit uh uh next

203
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,160
slide

204
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,260
and next slide again because I just

205
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,480
recap the problem statement for the ebit

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,100
but you already know from previous

207
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,180
version so what happened is that first

208
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
the document was adopted by the working

209
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,000
group thank you so much and to be honest

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,860
with you I mean there have been only

211
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,980
really minor updates updates to the to

212
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,600
the document

213
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,959
um nothing really worth mentioning maybe

214
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,779
I removed a little bit of text and word

215
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,779
because they were repeated from the tlv

216
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,240
draft and then I said instead of you

217
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,980
know repeating all of this let's just

218
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,000
refer to the uh to the other draft

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,040
um I have still one open question I

220
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,779
don't know if anybody has any thoughts

221
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,660
on it and whatever like the ebit so far

222
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,320
we do apply it to the informational tlvs

223
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,360
and things like that but of course we

224
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,279
have a stats message we have a

225
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,680
statistics message and I was very much

226
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,440
wondering and that is in a tlv format so

227
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,399
I was wondering three would the ebit

228
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,339
apply to the stats message as well if so

229
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,920
a little bit of text should be added and

230
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,860
I am really looking forward also on this

231
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,380
aspect to feedback if there is any I

232
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,959
think it makes sense but um you know

233
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,079
open to your thoughts

234
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,680
um and with this I'm finished on the

235
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,480
ebit as well

236
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,160
any thoughts comments

237
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,100
cool next next slide please

238
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,779
thank you

239
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,120
um so this is

240
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,660
um like an idea uh that we have a little

241
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,800
bit discussing with Camilo as well

242
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,440
um which is a logging of routing events

243
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,899
in BNP right

244
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,940
um so what is the idea next slide please

245
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,420
what

246
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,740
ah okay Chris I I never sorry Chris

247
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,459
um

248
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,700
um so what is the basic idea here

249
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,220
um the idea is that like we have a state

250
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,120
synchronization with the root monitoring

251
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,399
meaning that we it is mandatory that we

252
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,440
have an initial flooding of data and

253
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,260
then we get all the rest we have

254
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,480
debugging with the root mirroring okay

255
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,420
and with the root mirroring we should

256
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,000
send the verbatim copy High very high

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
fidelity of what's going on

258
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,380
and then we have a you know session data

259
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,480
and we have stats and all of that right

260
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,420
but what we are really missing is a

261
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,839
message type that is Event Event driven

262
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,300
right so um I don't know you have a

263
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,639
policy that policies uh I don't know

264
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,720
blocking uh or denying uh prefix uh then

265
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,180
uh you know we want you know to be

266
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,639
notified let's say or for example there

267
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,440
is some sort of validation taking place

268
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,899
on the router uh I don't know replica

269
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,579
validation or some sort of other

270
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,620
validation we want to know that

271
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,300
something didn't validate and things

272
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,160
like that right so all of this so far uh

273
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,320
as I was saying it doesn't exist also

274
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,860
the unchanged um so the um unchanged

275
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,440
analysis I mean you have to do really a

276
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,300
differential analysis for example

277
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,600
address being a pre and post policy you

278
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,180
have really to go like and scan the

279
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,760
whole pre-policy all the POS policy and

280
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,860
then you should derive what change

281
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,740
change it there right but you could also

282
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,779
have you know some sort of notification

283
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,620
like again these specific prefix didn't

284
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,139
make it to the post policy and and

285
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,180
things like that

286
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,180
um so this is the intuition uh it kind

287
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,880
of makes sense to me uh I hope it does

288
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,639
for you guys as well super duper looking

289
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,980
forward to your thoughts

290
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,200
um next slide please

291
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,420
and

292
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,700
um so that was the intuition this is the

293
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,060
execution so what essentially we did is

294
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,240
um we again uh did a message body that

295
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,279
is consistent with the root mirroring

296
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,120
again so it's all tlv we have a bgp

297
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,639
message pdu

298
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,720
um bishoping massage tlv that includes a

299
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,260
pdu with the so-called event subjects

300
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,560
event subjects would be nlri okay and

301
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,860
then the indexed informational tlv are

302
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,560
the event attributes right and so far

303
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,620
the only tlv that I did Define was the

304
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,779
event racing right so why we are

305
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,579
reporting something so essentially now

306
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,440
you can say that at the third the

307
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,959
angularri of this bgp update message

308
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,060
that of course is an artifact it doesn't

309
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,360
exist it didn't exist it's just a way to

310
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
convey the information uh that for

311
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,760
example it was policy denied or it was

312
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,060
not valid or something like

313
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,600
why I choose to go for a bgp pdu right

314
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,240
to convey this information because I

315
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,000
thought like uh we already have a code

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,519
to encode and to decode this kind of

317
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,980
information so I really wanted to be a

318
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,380
little bit low touch you know it is an

319
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,480
artifact I could have invented something

320
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,240
totally new uh and things like that but

321
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,519
it kind of didn't make sense to me right

322
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,579
uh but again super duper looking forward

323
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,480
for feedback uh lasting it's a tiny

324
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,480
detail uh in the flags we have something

325
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,579
that tells us whether it's pre or post

326
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,639
policy something I just removed that

327
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,639
flag because it still following an

328
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,839
intuition uh the the you know the the

329
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,720
event happens between a pre and post

330
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,820
policy right so it's in between

331
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,399
something is happening and it's

332
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,220
generating this kind of event

333
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,680
super duper again looking for feedback

334
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,699
next slide please

335
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,720
so status uh I am super duper conscious

336
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,079
that the draft uh need to be still

337
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,440
worked upon uh it's incomplete probably

338
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,860
uh there are also some errors in it and

339
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,720
things like that it was really a work

340
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,079
done in rush but I wanted to make sure

341
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,779
to present it here so to collect

342
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,360
feedback in person other than the

343
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,639
mailing list also it's a very humbled

344
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,399
down uh proposal so far like it only

345
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,759
applies to before V6 IP prefixes

346
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,420
um Can it can it apply to something else

347
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,899
than just IP prefixes right and also so

348
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,480
far I'm just saying that the bgp update

349
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,779
is enclosed in the bgp message tlv but

350
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,500
can we maybe report on different uh bgp

351
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,000
messages right so I am here uh crucifix

352
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,119
me throw me Tomatoes I mean I am you

353
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,959
know

354
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,260
looking for feedback thank you uh first

355
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,599
up is Jeff

356
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,059
and after that I am relaying a question

357
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,880
from the audience sure yeah Jeff is we

358
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,619
shall I crucifix you because you know

359
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,439
you would not be able to type so well

360
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,599
um

361
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,339
so you you have reached a magic point of

362
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,140
popularity you know with a protocol when

363
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,160
you know that you're trying to throw

364
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,860
everything into it so this is a good

365
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,179
time

366
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:33,919
um

367
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,480
the wisdom I would share with you is

368
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,520
that uh when you reach that point

369
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,500
there's a lot of discussion about should

370
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,059
you do this

371
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,100
yeah you're at the borderline right now

372
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,140
of you know you know have interesting

373
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,580
things you wish to report you have a

374
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,919
good mechanism that can carry it you

375
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
have some use cases that this may make

376
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,600
sense for you are heading down the road

377
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,880
very quickly to a generalized streaming

378
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,179
Telemetry mechanism that other things

379
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,400
may be trying to attach to and you

380
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,580
probably went to as grow figure out what

381
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,039
that line ends up being and try to keep

382
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,900
the lines nice and crisp

383
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,360
your overlapping spaces that you have to

384
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,280
worry about are you'll work out of like

385
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,840
netconf or uh streaming Yang extensions

386
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,280
uh you have gnmi coming out of

387
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,600
openconfig

388
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,500
so these are all good things uh

389
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,380
specific to BMP the thing I would

390
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,480
suggest you is the same thing I'd give

391
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,820
for the streaming Telemetry feedback

392
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,980
this is critical data that you're trying

393
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,740
to use the more things you put into you

394
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,360
know the drinking straw that's carrying

395
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
the fire hose you know the less you're

396
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,880
able to carry through quickly so you're

397
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,380
you're starting to get to the point

398
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,700
where you're looking for additional

399
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,799
channels that carry the same type of

400
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,559
information same protocol but perhaps

401
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,900
don't overload it on the same session

402
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,320
okay

403
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,039
uh shared matcha how can I

404
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,419
um

405
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,480
I want to Echo some you know impart what

406
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,419
what Jeff said which is uh if we're

407
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,220
going to have different bgp messages and

408
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,860
stuff be you know be reported

409
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,059
um I mean BMP is largely uh just the bgp

410
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,200
on The Wire

411
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,260
in a wrapper and so the ability to pass

412
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,299
through the MP and you know what other

413
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,419
whatever other stuff it is there uh and

414
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,880
then you know back on the uh you know

415
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,660
kind of the specific monitoring piece

416
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,840
is the vision that the router that you

417
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,400
would configure in the routers or the

418
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,799
b2p speaker the things that you would

419
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,559
want it to highlight to The Collector or

420
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,760
is that something that would happen in

421
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,080
The Collector it sounds like that would

422
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,240
be you know in the router exactly that

423
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,299
it would highlight it yeah and then you

424
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,340
know that that

425
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,320
makes a lot of questions about you know

426
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,460
then you're sticking that in an

427
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,039
ephemeral database on the router or is

428
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,919
it that live it live in the permanent

429
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,860
configuration store etc etc right

430
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,539
um which

431
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,580
you might want both and then that gets

432
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,160
back to the you know is this you know is

433
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,840
this analysis should it just be done

434
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,419
offline uh after the fact and that's

435
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,919
that's the way we've done it is we're

436
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,480
just taking all the data and we're

437
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,660
processing that uh after the fact out of

438
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,520
the routers

439
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,299
um

440
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,039
and just getting that mirror that

441
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
basically the mirror copy of all the

442
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,280
information so

443
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,660
um you know how much do you want to

444
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,539
build the alerting

445
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,600
mechanism into that

446
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
and have that be integrated in the

447
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,960
routers and I think having the routers

448
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,880
alert on that is a

449
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,120
very dangerous and slippery slope

450
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,660
yeah I I see to be honest with you um

451
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,440
like uh yeah uh what I found out is that

452
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,620
like if you want to find a difference

453
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,440
like a pre-policy to policy you have to

454
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,780
mine a ton amount of data at The

455
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,940
Collector just because you are fine

456
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,720
trying to find one tiny bit but you know

457
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,320
if the router is denying a prefix for

458
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,960
example for some reason I mean the let

459
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,940
me put it in between quotes the router

460
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,980
already knows

461
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,700
um so it just seems a more I don't know

462
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,340
efficient process although I see that

463
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,679
then you know you may be

464
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,760
um let's say uh uh yeah uh you are

465
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,919
overloading maybe the router

466
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,059
um on another

467
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,460
um aspect I that I wanted also to say I

468
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,179
mean this is uh similar I mean the Rel

469
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,940
naming it doesn't come out of nothing I

470
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,760
mean it comes from a Nell the netflow

471
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
event logging so I was kind of thinking

472
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,280
you know uh we are building a super

473
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,100
similar mechanism but tailored to bgp

474
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,199
something like that I don't know if

475
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,940
I think next up is ahmed's

476
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,080
El Hassani

477
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,799
this is more related from swisscom so

478
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,200
this is more related to the tlv uh draft

479
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,720
and I noticed that you bombed the

480
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,280
version from three to four for all

481
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,480
messages

482
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,820
which even for the messages that are not

483
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,640
touched by the draft uh the bars that

484
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
have to be updated and you have to do

485
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,760
something different

486
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,400
I'm wondering why not just change the

487
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,960
name a bit to indicate this is actually

488
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,520
new version that's coming up and maybe

489
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,679
bundle some of the other changes with it

490
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,480
as well since we are probably changing

491
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,919
the version anyway

492
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,799
changing the name of the that draft

493
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,039
oh make it more clear that there is a

494
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,780
new version coming up

495
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,880
um

496
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,600
okay thank you yeah I I will think about

497
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,080
that yeah

498
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,020
you said you wanted to relay something

499
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,000
from the yeah I wanted to relay a

500
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,919
question from Jared Mauch but then he

501
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,419
walked through the microphone and asked

502
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,600
questions

503
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,340
thank you so much Carlo yes thank you

504
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,840
uh next up BMP High availability data

505
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,820
collection my

506
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Lin

507
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,640
how do you pronounce your name would you

508
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,799
mind sharing that

509
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,200
um it's Joya

510
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,760
thank you

511
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,100
take it away please

512
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,410
okay

513
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:48,900
[Music]

514
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,220
um

515
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,740
my name is Julia Lin and I'm a master's

516
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,960
student studying in a global Polytechnic

517
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,200
in Paris and I'm happy to introduce to

518
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,900
you the high availability in vnp data

519
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,059
collection which is a project that I

520
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,700
have done in Switzerland for the past

521
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,940
six months from March and next slide

522
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,559
please

523
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,380
the goal of this project is to

524
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,919
guaranteeing and is to achieve BMP data

525
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,520
High availability and also do possible

526
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,020
load balance for other natural

527
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,740
telemetric data wire nuts why not

528
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,919
bringing a lot of data duplications and

529
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,960
nowadays as the network going larger

530
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,720
it's more and more important to uh to

531
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,780
network monitoring so we are so Network

532
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,480
Telemetry is very important and the

533
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,400
network Telemetry protocol we're using

534
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,799
in these projects is the BMP which is

535
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,799
based on bgp and BMP can provide us

536
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,960
access to different reps as well as

537
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
skipping being kept update about the bgp

538
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,960
events happening in the network

539
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,620
um

540
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,140
and this all this data is crucial for

541
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,020
monitoring networks the page the BMP

542
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,960
works as following it will have one bgp

543
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,380
router in the bgp network to export BMP

544
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,860
data to an external BMP stations

545
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,159
but as the network going larger it might

546
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,100
not be enough uh with it might not be

547
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,520
enough to have only the the single one

548
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,220
BMP one router and one stations

549
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,679
architectures so we want to introduce

550
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,080
more collectors and next slide please

551
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,620
for Prototype designs we have used two

552
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,559
collectors in the systems each collector

553
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,980
will expose it no sorry each router will

554
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,419
expose this BNP twice to to the to the

555
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,640
collectors means that both collector

556
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,000
will maintain bmp's uh identical BMP

557
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,279
sessions to guarantee BMP High

558
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,980
availability also with this architecture

559
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,380
it's also it's possible to do low

560
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,299
balance for other network telemetric

561
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,179
data for example ipfix but it's not

562
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,600
further discussed here and then since we

563
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,620
are having BMP data in both sides if we

564
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,200
dump all if we dump both of them to the

565
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
database we might bring a lot of

566
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,919
duplications so at the end of uh dumping

567
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,919
the the BMP data in the collectors we

568
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,020
have designed a share internal logic

569
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,480
Across The Collector to guarantee that

570
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,220
the BMP data is only forwarded once but

571
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,539
cached twice

572
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,539
and next slide please

573
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,179
the design is the following we will make

574
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,820
the collector to work in active standby

575
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,440
States and this active standbys uh why

576
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,559
only the active active collector will be

577
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,620
thumb paints BMP data and the standby

578
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,539
collector will not talk but still

579
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,520
keeping the BMP sessions

580
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,640
the active standby feature is decided by

581
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,159
its timestamp the timestamp is set at

582
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,220
the establishment of BMP sessions and

583
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,100
the time step will be set to the will be

584
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,279
sent to redis as a key and in this case

585
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,279
The Collector The Collector can exchange

586
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,340
it about their uh about their Works Day

587
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,880
by by The Key by the by the timestamp

588
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,779
kids

589
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,080
and redist and also signals are used for

590
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,179
maintenance purpose since we also want

591
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,520
to manually configure the active standby

592
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,980
States during runtime next slide please

593
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,640
since redis is using key value form 2 or

594
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,419
to sort records the timestamp keys sent

595
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,840
to redis is designed as the following to

596
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
include all necessary informations to

597
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,520
identify the collector and the session

598
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,520
so we have included the clustering and

599
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,940
cluster IDs and the cluster here

600
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,360
includes all the all the collectors in

601
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,500
the system in this in the previous

602
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,419
introductions we have two collectors so

603
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,520
in the cluster there will be two

604
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,580
collectors so the questioning and

605
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,620
cluster ID will be used to identify

606
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,260
which one is this and the core processes

607
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,720
core process name is used to identify

608
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,179
which session it is since we might have

609
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,240
different network Telemetry sessions and

610
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,460
this records these kids will be sent

611
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,760
with a two seconds time up what so it

612
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,980
needs to be kept refreshing and if it's

613
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,260
not refreshed then it will be time it

614
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,020
will be expired and deleted after two

615
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,140
seconds and then every seconds The

616
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,840
Collector the program PMS Mississippi

617
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,360
running in the collector will list all

618
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,480
the timestamp it gets from redis

619
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,260
and set the damp flag accordingly if the

620
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,419
down flag is true then the collector

621
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,120
will be active and if it's forced then

622
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,179
it will be stand by it and there are the

623
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,940
following four possible conditions if

624
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,299
the if if if in redis there is only

625
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,580
collector Ace timestamp then a will be

626
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,000
active and uh while the the state of B

627
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,120
will be unknown because if for B radius

628
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,960
is available it will it will not be it

629
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,059
will not be aware of the existence of

630
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,240
other collectors so it should be set to

631
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,480
it which it should be set to active to

632
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,520
make sure that the collector won't lose

633
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,200
any data

634
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,399
and uh if in the radius collector a has

635
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,380
the smallest tangent then it should be

636
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,620
active and B should be standby and if a

637
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,539
has not the smaller timestamp then n

638
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,880
should be standby and B should be active

639
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,260
next slide please

640
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,159
since we're using uh pmcct in the

641
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,020
collectors it's easier for us to

642
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,320
implement this sure internal logic BMS

643
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,220
CCT is a powerful set of it's a powerful

644
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,460
network monitoring too

645
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,940
with pmscity we can simply Implement uh

646
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,580
the the the software logic at The

647
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,559
Dumping process and The Dumping program

648
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,379
of the BMP data so it can

649
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,159
um so it can

650
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,880
so we can and Implement our implement

651
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,179
the logic uh easily next slide please

652
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,799
there are two uh there are two workflow

653
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,460
for the for the projects for a regular

654
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,179
workflow we should first uh the system

655
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,760
will write collectors timestamp key to

656
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,399
redis with a two seconds time out and

657
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,020
then they will get all the timestamped

658
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,279
from redist so that it can be uh be

659
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,840
aware of the work states of other

660
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,940
collectors in the cluster and then it

661
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,980
will make a comparison a month or the

662
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,779
timestamp and set the template

663
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,700
accordingly

664
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,799
um more specific key the forward

665
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,940
conditions that I have mentioned before

666
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,220
and at the end they will sleep for one

667
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,279
seconds and repeat the whole workflow

668
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,340
and but if we want to manually configure

669
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,960
the states we can put it into

670
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,360
maintenance mode by sending a signal 34

671
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,520
for example

672
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,559
signal 34 is used to refresh the

673
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,779
timestamp and if this signal is called

674
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,659
it will set the collector will set the

675
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,899
timestamp to current times and the right

676
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,899
is ready New Testament to reduce

677
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,440
since it has now the larger timestamp we

678
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,919
will definitely become standby

679
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:45,779
immediately but for the other collectors

680
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,919
they will be aware of the change of the

681
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,399
of this change by getting by getting

682
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,100
time stamps from ready so there might be

683
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,620
some delays and this delay will be

684
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,240
maximum two seconds

685
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,380
next slide please

686
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,299
we have mentioned before that only the

687
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,940
active collector will dump but for the

688
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,880
uh but the standby collector will not

689
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,520
export any metrics to the database but

690
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,860
he will kept receiving BNP data and BMP

691
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,039
rips BMP events in

692
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,500
um in the local cache for two seconds

693
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,279
this is to avoid that if a flip if a

694
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,340
failover happens for example if it needs

695
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,039
to switch from standby to active uh

696
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,320
since there is a delay there without we

697
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,679
do not want to lose any data so the the

698
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,580
new receipts BMP events will be cached

699
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,100
in the local buffer for two seconds and

700
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,620
once there is a failover happens the uh

701
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,840
the data that's in the buffer will be

702
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,960
dumped firstly and the failover magnets

703
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,360
work as following assume that there are

704
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
two collectors A and B while accepting

705
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,480
and B standbytes if collector a has

706
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,559
crashed and has crashed and for example

707
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,679
it has been shut down the

708
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,840
then the braid is then the key in the

709
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,299
radius will be timed out in maximum two

710
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,000
seconds because we don't know that if

711
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,760
it's been shut down by sending signals

712
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,899
or

713
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,880
um or shutting down the shutting down

714
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,440
the collector if we shut down the

715
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,820
collector then we need to wait until the

716
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,299
um until the key expired itself and only

717
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:36,659
after the key in the

718
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,559
the key in red is expired then the the

719
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,240
other collector can be aware of the

720
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,480
change of this collector and let's say B

721
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,600
is now the collector uh who has the

722
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,059
lowest timestamp so it will naturally

723
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,059
become active and then it will for what

724
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,039
it would do is to firstly send the local

725
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,799
cache to the database and then it will

726
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,820
work in no normal workflow to send all

727
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,460
the BMP traffic that they have received

728
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,480
to the database next slide please

729
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,480
for testings we have designed two demand

730
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,699
setup and three demand setup the three

731
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,760
demand setup is used to prove that this

732
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,040
project can also be applied for multiple

733
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,239
collectors

734
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,199
next slide please

735
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,940
uh we don't have animation here so we

736
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,739
can see that there are two pictures and

737
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,080
the first one is the results of two

738
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,599
demon setup and the second one is three

739
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,320
demand setup for the two demand setup if

740
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,300
we look at the first picture of BMP

741
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,879
metrics we can notice that even there's

742
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,580
there are two collectors maintaining BMP

743
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,500
sessions there will be only one

744
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,960
collector dumping to the database so

745
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,379
it's only there is only one line

746
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,800
uh at the uh at the same time

747
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,680
but at uh on the right on the right side

748
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,320
there are two pictures of ipfix loads

749
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,740
received from uh the two the two demons

750
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,060
so ipfix is always received and uh uh

751
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,960
from from both sides and it will not be

752
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,320
influenced but since here we uh we we

753
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,460
use uh we try to simulate the failover

754
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,339
by shutting down the collector the ipfix

755
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:29,520
flow received from these two sites will

756
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,460
be slight difference so I prefix

757
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,119
received from a uh will be slightly less

758
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,400
than that from B since we have shut down

759
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,020
H to make the active failover to be and

760
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,780
for the three demons setup we can also

761
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,720
notice that there is only one a month a

762
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,300
month three demons there is only one

763
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,040
um one one demon dumping the BMP data

764
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,460
and but however ip4 is always received

765
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,000
from all three uh all three collectors

766
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,760
so it works for both two and three

767
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,460
demons even for more and if we want to

768
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,040
add more demons it's just a matter of

769
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,920
configuration and it's easily to add

770
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,119
next slide please

771
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,359
to sum up this the goal of this project

772
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,400
is to

773
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
um the most important goal is to ensure

774
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,099
the high availability of BMP data and in

775
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,960
the other hand we also want to do a

776
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,420
possible load balance by introducing

777
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,599
more collectors to the systems for other

778
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,200
network telemetric data

779
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,720
however we don't want to

780
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,640
introduce data duplications since we

781
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,099
have more collectors maintaining

782
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,880
identical BMP data so we have designed

783
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,460
assistance to make sure that BMP data is

784
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,820
cached twice in The Collector but or

785
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,220
only forwarded once to the database to

786
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,020
help in scalability

787
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,480
and let's forward the introduced

788
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,680
introduction thanks and for backup uh if

789
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,020
uh if we go to next two slides there

790
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,900
will be the the state machine of The

791
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,480
Dumping process and the data queue and

792
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,640
that's all for my introduction thank you

793
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,940
so much

794
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,380
thank you so much for sharing uh these

795
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,280
insights and outline of the designs who

796
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,920
establish High availability in data

797
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,240
collection

798
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,180
um I think we have two people that want

799
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,839
to ask questions

800
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,119
let's go with Chris Morrow first as he

801
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,980
was the first one to indicate on zulup

802
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,140
that he has a question

803
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,579
I think actually Jeff has the same

804
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,800
question so I'll be easier with him in

805
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,940
the room I think okay we go to Jeff

806
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,920
this is Jeff has thank you Joel for your

807
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,260
presentation

808
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,000
I had first one question about your time

809
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,980
stamps then a comment about your

810
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,060
methodology

811
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,160
what time stamp exactly are you

812
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,780
collecting what what is the trigger

813
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,579
event is this coming from the DMP

814
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,560
protocol or is this messages that are

815
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,180
coming from The Collector receiving a

816
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,420
thing no it's just the current time it's

817
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,960
uh it's the Unix timestamp

818
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,579
Unix timestamp of The Collector

819
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:21,960
receiving a message

820
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,260
uh no the the Unix timestamp of the

821
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,460
start time of the collector

822
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,839
okay

823
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,880
so this goes into my comment about

824
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,040
methodology I think

825
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,200
so one of the problems that you'll have

826
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,320
for BMP is that uh with your displayed

827
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,440
slide here collector a and collector B

828
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,300
receiving from the same router

829
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,540
there is no guarantee that they will

830
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,820
receive the same messages

831
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,780
um in some cases bgp

832
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,240
suppression of no route change may cause

833
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,520
different messages to show route orders

834
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,940
may be different and other such things

835
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,700
so one of your challenges is for

836
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,380
deduplication

837
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,200
that there may be different reasons why

838
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,839
the collectors are not in the same point

839
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,320
of synchronization with a a router

840
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,079
learning its state from bgp

841
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,420
if the routers go quiet and the state

842
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,400
converges at The Collector the final

843
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,920
State should be the same

844
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,020
but there's no guarantee that during

845
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,300
learning State especially during High

846
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,640
degrees of churn that the state will be

847
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,140
identical

848
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,220
have you accounted for this

849
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,680
since is since the BMP session is

850
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,400
established from uh from 1 pm from one

851
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,579
bgp router it's just about configuration

852
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,800
so we have configured the router to

853
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,960
stand identical BMP session to The

854
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,460
Collector

855
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,520
I understand your configuration what I'm

856
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,440
telling you is that in such a

857
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,780
configuration there is no guarantee that

858
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,780
data is the same uh the eventual

859
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,599
converged state will be the same so to

860
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,460
give it easy example

861
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,140
you know presume that collector a

862
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,859
receives prefix 10 8 no from Pure a

863
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:18,000
and much time goes by and you know

864
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,800
collector B eventually could receive the

865
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,000
same state

866
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,060
or maybe 10 8 has changed at some point

867
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,520
as well and collector B is instead

868
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,140
getting the most recent thing while

869
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,700
collector a has yet to receive the

870
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,420
recent update so eventual consistency

871
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,720
shall happen but incremental consistency

872
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,720
is not there this is a common problem

873
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,480
with uh distributed computing type

874
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,380
things

875
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,500
so my suggestion to you is as part of

876
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,859
your uh continuing work uh maybe

877
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,240
consider how you would want to address

878
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,460
this in the database

879
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,700
yes we have we have discussed this uh at

880
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,859
the beginning but since this is just for

881
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,960
Prototype we have skipped this we have

882
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,960
considered to also think the BMP data

883
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,520
that you have received from the router

884
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,579
to uh to redis so that we can make sure

885
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,160
that they are working synchronously but

886
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,320
since this just the first day we have

887
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,560
skipped this and we by default consider

888
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,420
that they are receiving identical BMP

889
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,900
data and uh in this way uh if we ignore

890
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,640
this we can

891
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,180
um

892
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,640
we can just implement the active standby

893
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,820
feature but but you're right this will

894
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,820
be the next step to do uh that we need

895
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,300
to sync the BMP data that it receives

896
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,260
okay thank you

897
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,760
any other questions comments remarks

898
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,160
Chris

899
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,280
yeah so first off I also would say this

900
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,900
looks like pretty cool work I appreciate

901
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,700
you presenting it

902
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,800
and it wasn't clear from the slide deck

903
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,900
that you're sort of in still the

904
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,760
discovery phase of how this all works

905
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,859
but I or how it's going to work I should

906
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,240
say uh

907
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,700
I think the point Jeff was making I also

908
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,400
had the same question about which what's

909
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,079
sort of the primary key that you decide

910
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,900
you got the same message at both places

911
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,579
it's not it seems like that's hidden in

912
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,280
your redis custom key comment so

913
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,020
I think if you

914
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,380
skip down the road later you'll come to

915
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,500
the same state where you say oh wow

916
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,240
the BMP

917
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,579
uh collection isn't necessarily

918
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:33,960
guaranteed to be guaranteed to be

919
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,520
synchronized in time that's sort of

920
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,859
Jeff's comment and that you'll have to

921
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,440
figure out which nlri which be it which

922
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,320
bgp message in BMP is the same

923
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,300
to tell which one is which collector has

924
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,820
you know you want to to use here and it

925
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,320
may be that you don't even care so much

926
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,380
about primary and and backup State you

927
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,240
just care about getting a single stream

928
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,920
out the back end

929
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,079
so anyway I appreciate your your

930
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,020
presentation it was super nice thanks

931
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,800
thank you

932
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,020
yeah this is Sarah and Ellsberg from

933
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,540
Austin University I have like a question

934
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,599
about you talked a lot about redis so

935
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,579
has have you also thought about like

936
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:17,819
introducing an intermediate service to

937
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,220
um not only safest timestamps into your

938
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,420
radius and KV but also like in other

939
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,220
technology like memcache D or something

940
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,640
like that

941
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,160
uh could you repeat the main cached it I

942
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,160
because I never heard about that before

943
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,400
yeah I think it can can be like makes a

944
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,200
lot of sense if you have like this

945
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,839
intermediate service to just use also

946
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,180
another technology not only redis I mean

947
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,160
of course that is maybe the the major

948
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,680
one but uh maybe another company that

949
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,359
does not use already so you would have

950
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,180
like a lot of uh advantages when you

951
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,880
introduce like this intermediate service

952
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,619
yeah

953
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,260
the the reason why I'm using redis is

954
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,079
that we have we are the swisscom is

955
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,020
already using pme CCT to uh to the

956
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,480
network telemetric in The Collector and

957
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,760
where this is naturally supported in PMA

958
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,579
CCT and if I explore the timestamp to

959
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:18,000
read this since uh PMA CCT is already

960
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,160
years across the collector then it's

961
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,420
easy for them to exchange but uh so I

962
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,960
would say this design is is highly based

963
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,500
on the uh pmsicity which is already used

964
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,859
in the collectors then but if we want to

965
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,560
play for other companies and need to um

966
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,280
who is not using pme CCT then it will

967
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,780
need to decide another solution probably

968
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,660
all right okay makes sense thanks

969
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,099
thank you

970
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,859
Sufferin would you mind emailing uh the

971
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,280
presenter a pointer to memcache

972
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,440
because I heard absolutely I will have

973
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,780
an offline talk with them thank you

974
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,020
thanks

975
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,480
all right thank you so much for your

976
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,740
presentation

977
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,020
thank you so much

978
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,400
move on to the next item

979
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,339
Camilo

980
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,339
Cardona

981
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,440
I always get nervous here

982
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,780
really yes no need to be nervous we're

983
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,640
all friends here

984
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,640
my first time was Soulful so

985
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,920
okay

986
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,440
so a couple of updates for a couple of

987
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,480
drafts we have currently running on the

988
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,480
working group first of all is the update

989
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,599
on the BMP and module next one please

990
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,359
um so this is a short one so

991
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:53,160
uh compared to the latest version we we

992
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,460
presented in the latest ITF we had a few

993
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,280
a few differences so first of all Tom

994
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,800
patch went full young doctor to the

995
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,920
model I can only thank him enough uh he

996
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,480
made multiple comments we tried to

997
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,680
address them all uh we have still yet to

998
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,440
change the names of some containers and

999
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,800
identities we had attending we will do

1000
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,780
it Jeff has of course always checks the

1001
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,880
model and he's very helpful I also again

1002
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,640
can only thank him for his observations

1003
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,940
uh for the more midi stuff uh since the

1004
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,220
first email that's about the first time

1005
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,200
we introduced the model team Evans

1006
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,359
mentioned that he would like to have

1007
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,599
initial delay on back of timers uh that

1008
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,599
doesn't hurt so uh initial delay we

1009
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,540
added um back of timer is actually part

1010
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,560
of the BMP RFC so we try to model that

1011
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,920
in the Yan module uh if anybody can take

1012
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,900
a look I personally

1013
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,560
check if there was any exponential back

1014
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,440
of this container somewhere in the ITF I

1015
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,940
couldn't find it so I mean we did it

1016
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,060
from scratch that's it for the more

1017
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,000
controversial part yeah

1018
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,599
um

1019
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,640
uh jimin Chen I think I mentioned this

1020
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,520
briefly the latest ITF he mentioned a

1021
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,619
news case in which he would like to send

1022
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:16,020
specific prefixes to the station to the

1023
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,980
VMP station uh this goes very well with

1024
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,920
our thought or what we have presented

1025
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,900
previously in which we would like to

1026
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,300
have a very flexible but very accurate

1027
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,040
way of defining what to send to the

1028
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,680
station because not all of us have ways

1029
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,839
of ingesting 50 million packets every

1030
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,079
minute and so having a way of this of

1031
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:39,359
selecting exactly what you want could

1032
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,260
help and extend adaptability adoption of

1033
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,880
BMP so he jimin actually also mentioned

1034
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,099
that there was this routing policy model

1035
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:52,200
already available in the ATF already

1036
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,599
standardized so we're using that

1037
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,780
uh the relative policy model even though

1038
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,880
simple is still powerful enough that

1039
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,520
maybe there can be some some stuff that

1040
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,160
makes no sense for BMP like if you mash

1041
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,800
or filters on like an attribute maybe

1042
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,540
that makes no sense but uh but we'll see

1043
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,880
I mean we'll check it out how it works

1044
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,480
uh but but we added it yep next one

1045
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,660
please

1046
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,880
uh that's it uh the call for adoption I

1047
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,640
don't know if it got a bit orphaned

1048
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,720
cheers I don't know what happened there

1049
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,819
but we'll continue working on it on on

1050
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:29,220
this because I think we need it

1051
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,040
I will double check the status and uh do

1052
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,599
the needful thing thank you for the

1053
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:34,859
reminder okay

1054
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:39,200
that's it any questions or comments

1055
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,780
let me see there's no

1056
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,040
let's see what's your path marking one

1057
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,279
now

1058
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,780
Camilla but what you want your path

1059
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,400
marking deck now

1060
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,700
yeah let's do that no questions about

1061
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,220
parking you're up again okay so for the

1062
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,240
next one

1063
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,400
um

1064
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,000
so uh this is a another draft that we

1065
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,740
introduced previously even a couple of

1066
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,599
years ago

1067
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,220
um just an update on this one next one

1068
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,140
please so this is the path status steel

1069
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,300
beat

1070
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,760
um so just as an overview uh what this

1071
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,480
DLB does is to as to convey the pets the

1072
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,140
path status of a path in a tlb optional

1073
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,240
what is a path status whether the path

1074
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,400
is installed whether the path is a

1075
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,960
backup whether the path has been

1076
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,960
rejected or filtered uh whether parties

1077
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,880
have not passed where the path is for

1078
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,400
forwarding like this sort of thing uh

1079
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,260
and there's an optional reason field if

1080
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,200
you want to go crazy and convey also why

1081
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,839
the status happen like if it's filtered

1082
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:57,240
because of local prefer oh sorry if it's

1083
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,680
installed because of local preference or

1084
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,480
I mean if you can do that then there's

1085
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,119
an optional result field for that

1086
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,280
um it depends on the tlb draft power

1087
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,020
already I mean this that's getting

1088
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,540
progress so it's getting mature so we

1089
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,040
were more confident about this also

1090
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,560
about with the ebit

1091
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,819
um I don't have to follow the a bit

1092
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:16,680
where I will just introduce it so thanks

1093
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,720
to David basically every company could

1094
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,760
do their own uh their own status right

1095
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,760
so I mean if they have a property way of

1096
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,980
status then they can use David and

1097
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,240
convey it

1098
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,078
and next one please

1099
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,480
um so there's no much difference on this

1100
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,540
draft compared to the latest version uh

1101
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,819
so in small editorial changes we added a

1102
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,040
few more examples some bad status

1103
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,560
so here's the thing in the draft we

1104
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,660
actually don't want to standardize any

1105
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,280
path status we want that to be done

1106
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,920
somewhere else I think I I always get

1107
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,319
lost I don't know if it's Indiana or I

1108
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,000
get lost where where this sort of thing

1109
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,640
gets standardized uh but I still I

1110
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,740
really well this is me I really think

1111
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,140
that uh without the examples it's very

1112
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,660
hard to understand the draft so uh but

1113
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,880
maybe with this is a bit more clear so I

1114
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,339
do not know whether uh whether I mean

1115
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:09,839
just to make an expression without the

1116
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,839
examples of bad status and just continue

1117
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:15,960
doing it like that or keep it there for

1118
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,700
a while so to make it clear for the

1119
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,520
people that read it or I know uh

1120
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,319
reference a previous version which I

1121
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,940
don't know if you can do that so that's

1122
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,859
a general question I I do not know how

1123
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:29,339
to do that so or at least I maybe we can

1124
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:30,599
discuss it later

1125
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,680
uh next one please

1126
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,520
okay so uh again uh why this is

1127
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,319
interesting

1128
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,619
um uh in our first use case

1129
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,059
um

1130
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:46,859
it will be for instance interesting to

1131
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,980
know uh when a path is being filtered uh

1132
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,319
right now yes we can do that we can take

1133
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,859
the pre in the post in compare it uh

1134
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,980
it's a lot of work and uh and and this

1135
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,480
is interesting information if you can

1136
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,520
achieve obtain it directly from the

1137
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,800
router uh and if you can know the real

1138
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,200
well the reason or the status like maybe

1139
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,180
a path was filtered because of a policy

1140
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,859
maybe a path was filtered because it has

1141
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,079
an invalid graph I mean this sort of

1142
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,180
thing can be useful because if we have

1143
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,880
data other data additional data from the

1144
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,040
network or historical data then we can

1145
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,480
know if maybe it's hunting is wrong

1146
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,900
before somebody calls and complains uh I

1147
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,599
mean that's like a low hanging fruit uh

1148
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,040
again we can do that already but

1149
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,220
comparing pre and post in can be very

1150
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,440
painful if you have a lot of messages or

1151
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,020
a big routing table

1152
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,900
um you know in a more com I mean complex

1153
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,319
cases but it's still useful at least

1154
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,700
both co-authors of the wrap at some

1155
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,700
point careers we're working in a system

1156
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,440
that uh

1157
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,460
that basically would like to offer

1158
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,819
what if scenarios for networks and of

1159
00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:58,920
course nobody wants to do bgp Simulator

1160
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,880
for that but if the router somehow can

1161
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,960
send

1162
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,680
what paths are backup then you can let's

1163
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,500
say cheaply do some what if a scenario

1164
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,420
analysis like okay if this fails then I

1165
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,280
already know the backup it might not be

1166
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,980
perfect but it's better than nothing so

1167
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,740
that's for instance one other example

1168
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,480
and also if you have a very diverse

1169
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,660
environment with a lot of a lot of paths

1170
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,859
then you're getting from the local group

1171
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:28,680
for instance then you might be able to

1172
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,940
know which parts are being is for

1173
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,859
forwarding or not and I mean you can

1174
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:35,579
have different use cases for that uh

1175
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,540
um okay next one please

1176
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,260
um the status of these from what you

1177
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,000
understand but I need to visualize

1178
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,660
Huawei already supported we have uh I

1179
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,940
mean I I I

1180
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,960
model this in escapee and against pmsgt

1181
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,700
and it's already showing it so at least

1182
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,579
there's or there that the wire format

1183
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:59,819
looks good enough uh so there's a bit of

1184
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,500
implementations I mean we probably need

1185
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,359
to officialize that so to move this

1186
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,280
forward but if anybody has any more

1187
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,260
questions or comments please let us know

1188
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,400
or I mean ask here

1189
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,000
and that's it

1190
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,500
thank you so much

1191
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,119
any questions comments

1192
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,980
all right thank you Camillo I would say

1193
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,079
this was a smooth presentation thank you

1194
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,619
for your time

1195
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,380
uh next up we have Martin Pell's

1196
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,180
for

1197
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,940
uh a topic that is not yet an internet

1198
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:43,020
draft but perhaps uh

1199
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,359
beautiful things will come out of this

1200
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,640
take it away oh and make sure to point

1201
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,400
the microphone at uh

1202
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,940
your mouth

1203
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,500
say it's okay

1204
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,040
no maybe just hold it all right here we

1205
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,180
go

1206
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,040
um so yeah as job mentioned this is not

1207
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,880
a draft yet uh could be maybe I just

1208
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,800
wanted to throw this at the group

1209
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,680
to see if there's uh interest for it

1210
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,759
next slide

1211
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:19,559
so the basic idea is

1212
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:20,880
you're gonna have to get closer to the

1213
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,700
mic you're just barely audible yeah you

1214
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,200
have to actually speak directly into the

1215
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,420
front of the mic so hold on your hand

1216
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,280
and your yeah great pretend you're 50

1217
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,380
Cent okay

1218
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,480
um so yeah it's another draft uh it's

1219
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,980
just an idea I wanted to throw out the

1220
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,660
group

1221
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,760
um and the idea is to uh to Define uh

1222
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,040
BHP communities large communities

1223
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,720
extended communities in a Json structure

1224
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,240
uh why would you want to do that first

1225
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,440
of all

1226
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,800
to have a standardized way for

1227
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,740
publication right now

1228
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,859
isps published their bgp communities on

1229
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,180
their website

1230
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,020
or in their autumnum objects in the irr

1231
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,000
but it's all uh

1232
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,700
plain text and if you want to do

1233
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,500
anything with it you're going to have to

1234
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,079
figure out what they actually want and

1235
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,740
how to parse that

1236
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,500
uh so yeah that's the second reason uh

1237
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,079
if I wanted to do this is if you have

1238
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,880
tools that want to look at bgp

1239
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,900
communities

1240
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,680
uh such as uh looking glasses then it

1241
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,720
becomes much easier if we have a

1242
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,880
structured way to describe them

1243
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,960
next slide please

1244
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,260
so an example tool that could use this

1245
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,900
is a Looking Glass

1246
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,619
um

1247
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:50,400
so I'm a part of uh you know knock and

1248
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,940
uh here we run a Looking Glass that

1249
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,640
that we recently uh

1250
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,400
modified to display descriptions for bgp

1251
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,660
communities and this is basically a

1252
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,280
self-compiled text file with communities

1253
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,839
and descriptions

1254
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:09,300
and yeah if you want to change anything

1255
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,880
to that you have to

1256
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,300
go in and modify text file

1257
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,780
yeah which is not really a nice solution

1258
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,220
uh next slide please

1259
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,500
so uh I made some examples of how what

1260
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,559
this could like look like first example

1261
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:34,559
is based on the RFC 8195 this describes

1262
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,420
a way to use bgp large communities

1263
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,099
and sets up a structure with

1264
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:47,099
ASN a function and a parameter so it

1265
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,020
divides the community up into three

1266
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,099
fields

1267
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,220
and then the RFC also gives a couple of

1268
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,640
advantages examples

1269
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,220
such as uh defining Community for uh

1270
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:06,720
to instruct an ISP not to export a route

1271
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,300
through a certain as

1272
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,380
next slide please

1273
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,559
so how would that look in adjacent what

1274
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,020
could it look like

1275
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,319
um we would have a template for the

1276
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,660
community in this case I'm calling it

1277
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,200
RFC 8195 and there we defined the two

1278
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,099
custom fields that this community has

1279
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:34,619
function field and the parameter field

1280
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:37,520
next slide please

1281
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,000
and then based on this we would have a

1282
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,099
large BHP community

1283
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:47,900
in this case advertise

1284
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,720
instructing a

1285
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,319
as64497 not to export to as6551

1286
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:58,200
and there we uh indeed again take the

1287
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,359
two Fields the function field we set it

1288
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:03,119
to four which in the previous slide was

1289
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,420
uh was set through no export

1290
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,299
and as a parameter we take the as of the

1291
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:13,500
beer that we do not want to export to

1292
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,660
and of course we also have the global

1293
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,460
administrator field that we filled so

1294
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,380
that's the Azam

1295
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,579
uh next slide please

1296
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,380
another example is uh

1297
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,260
for an RFC 4384

1298
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,319
this defines HP communities used for

1299
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,700
data collection

1300
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,160
and that can be used to tag your

1301
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,960
prefixes

1302
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,720
with a for example a region or a country

1303
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,119
code to show where they were originated

1304
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,260
next slide please

1305
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,559
so here we do a similar thing we have

1306
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,359
fields for the region

1307
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:57,720
uh this RFC also has a satellite field

1308
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,780
which is one or zero and a country code

1309
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,040
which is uh encoded in a bit stream

1310
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,000
next slide please

1311
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,720
and again then we would have an uh an

1312
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,240
instance of this community which would

1313
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,880
Define routes originated in the

1314
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,980
Netherlands which would have a

1315
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,440
particular region EU this is the

1316
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,400
bitstring defined by this RFC for you

1317
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,280
uh satellite set to zero and the country

1318
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,920
code for the Netherlands encoded

1319
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,200
according to this RPG

1320
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,160
next slide please

1321
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,359
so yeah this is all just a rough idea

1322
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,520
I would like to hear some comments if

1323
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,980
this is interesting and if there are

1324
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,359
people that

1325
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:50,460
would like to work on this

1326
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,540
please come talk to me

1327
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:01,920
all right Jairus was Jarrett was first

1328
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,559
in the queue so um let's start there

1329
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:10,559
so I think

1330
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,020
this this could be interesting I think

1331
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,559
there's a couple concerns I have

1332
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,140
um which mostly can be solved so for

1333
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,660
example that uh there is the Ayana

1334
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,660
registry for example that has all of the

1335
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,180
well-known b2p communities in there

1336
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,700
uh and so I don't know if we would want

1337
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,319
to look to that for some of the

1338
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:32,940
formatting and stuff because they do

1339
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,940
already have an XML format I know Json

1340
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,460
is the current sexy thing until we all

1341
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,000
moved to seabor or something else

1342
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,740
um you know or whatever is in the future

1343
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,319
but we may want to just look to that for

1344
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,839
for some of this because uh there is a

1345
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:52,260
lot of ranging here the other thing is

1346
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,400
uh

1347
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,079
having been involved in a different

1348
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,760
discussion earlier today about regular

1349
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,160
or this week about regular expressions

1350
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,980
and how to define those a lot of us have

1351
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,839
bgp communities that match regular

1352
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,059
Expressions that we would maybe not want

1353
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,920
to specify all of the things but be able

1354
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,500
to drop a regex in rather than expanding

1355
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,059
the entire thing because it's going to

1356
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:14,339
be very large so we need to think about

1357
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:16,920
how we would encode either regexes or

1358
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,500
ranges

1359
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,420
um with some of which is done there I

1360
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,099
think the other thing is we want to also

1361
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:26,040
be a little cautious about this because

1362
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,200
uh there have been efforts in the past

1363
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,940
to try and Define

1364
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,839
a number of uh new

1365
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,660
softly well-known bgp communities like

1366
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,940
same country or country codes and stuff

1367
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,619
like that and trying to standardize that

1368
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:44,280
across the industry as well and so

1369
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,859
um we we should be conscious as we're

1370
01:02:46,859 --> 01:02:49,559
doing this and then the last piece is

1371
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:51,660
the same as many other things like

1372
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,540
geofeeds and such is how do we discover

1373
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,440
where to find the list of them so if I

1374
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,240
is

1375
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,980
Akamai or Aya's you know you use

1376
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,559
coloclue you know have a list of those

1377
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,339
you know where is how do you discover

1378
01:03:07,339 --> 01:03:09,960
where they're well-defined and well

1379
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,480
documented list is is that something we

1380
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,760
want to have in scope

1381
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,160
so that's a couple of my thoughts on

1382
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,420
this

1383
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,400
I don't know I don't know if you have

1384
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,299
any

1385
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:23,299
feedback on that

1386
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,520
uh thanks that's a very good feedback on

1387
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,900
the last one

1388
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,119
um Europe actually suggested maybe we

1389
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:32,700
could do something with the RP API to

1390
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,339
publish and publish them there

1391
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:40,700
but uh good feedback and thanks

1392
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,380
hey Camilo Cardona from NTT uh I would

1393
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,280
just say

1394
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,559
um I mean this is not a anything against

1395
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,619
I'm just saying consider also doing it

1396
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,420
in yank or doing it in junk and making

1397
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,059
Jason a Jason a schema from it I mean

1398
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:55,680
I'm not going to say no to Jason's Kim

1399
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,119
it's also fine I'm just saying that

1400
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,420
maybe for the Machinery of the ITF you

1401
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,040
will fight at some point somebody that

1402
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,380
says why not Young

1403
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,359
uh well I I maybe a structure is simple

1404
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,400
enough I think there will be nothing no

1405
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,799
problem doing it there that's it I mean

1406
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,559
just consider doing it in junk

1407
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,180
and I think you can compare that to Json

1408
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,660
schema easily from there so that's it

1409
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,020
okay

1410
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,319
files

1411
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,819
I've been having a flavor of this

1412
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,380
discussion three or four times with

1413
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,180
different people including with job and

1414
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,160
you know Jared and a few other people so

1415
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,700
the thinking is in the right ballpark so

1416
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,020
this is a good idea I I think you know I

1417
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,099
would suggest taking a number of

1418
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,960
different directions but what also just

1419
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,059
directly is I'm happy to directly

1420
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:46,920
collaborate on this one because I have a

1421
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,079
large wish list and suggestions on how

1422
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:50,880
this can move forward if if you're

1423
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,119
interested but the easy ones are you

1424
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:56,940
know Yang schema to model the thing and

1425
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,500
then at that point you have many places

1426
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,780
that you can transfer the data including

1427
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:04,079
seabor the thing you're going to find is

1428
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,619
high level problems uh Jared hits the

1429
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:10,079
point of we don't want to try to be too

1430
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,339
normative about how people use

1431
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:13,500
communities mostly what we're looking

1432
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,020
for is a way to allow for communities to

1433
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,780
be described and allow that to be

1434
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,000
consumed by routers for informational

1435
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,260
purposes or config purposes

1436
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:26,280
that moves us into the problem of how

1437
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,559
you distribute the thing you know rpki

1438
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:29,880
is an example of how you would want to

1439
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,380
maybe discover these sort of things or

1440
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,260
at least where to pull the data from

1441
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:35,280
signing the data you know from the

1442
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,520
provider falls into the same place and

1443
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,319
finally these the speed at which you can

1444
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,119
consume these things you know Json is

1445
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:45,119
not a it's not the worst format ever but

1446
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,099
it's pretty darn close

1447
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:48,299
um

1448
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:52,460
and you know you're going to find

1449
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,660
yeah it could be xdr or something like

1450
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,460
that

1451
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,920
um but uh being able to consume the

1452
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,599
things fast on the routers would

1453
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:01,980
probably push us through something more

1454
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,599
long lines like Seaboard we're starting

1455
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,280
to get good experience across multiple

1456
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,380
vendors with that is a nice binary

1457
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,540
format for fast consumption of

1458
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,839
structured data so a lot of comments

1459
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:14,339
good idea

1460
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:16,380
thrilled to collaborate if you want that

1461
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,819
much appreciated thanks

1462
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:25,980
from swisscom very interesting for sure

1463
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,420
um just a few things I would like to

1464
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,500
point here I'm not sure if you think

1465
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,720
about it before or not but

1466
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,280
um you know right now we have collectors

1467
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,140
like the MCT which is collecting a

1468
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,760
little bit traffic and then push it back

1469
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,079
to uh

1470
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,420
for further analysis in some kind of

1471
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,420
message bus and they look at the bgp

1472
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,780
messages and then transform it in

1473
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:47,700
non-standard way to another format Json

1474
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,260
or outdoor or something like that and

1475
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,000
would be nice to look at this use case

1476
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,859
in general uh it's very interesting use

1477
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:54,299
case because you know most of the

1478
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:55,740
analytical programs on top of these

1479
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,260
things will not consume the wire bgp

1480
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,819
it's not only about the community but

1481
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,160
maybe we should start to consider like

1482
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,760
what other type of applications in the

1483
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,859
network automation mode that will need

1484
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:10,260
to understand the B2B messages as they

1485
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,000
come from the router but they don't want

1486
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,220
to deal with parsing visually messages

1487
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,359
because

1488
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,579
that you have it's kind of complicated

1489
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,920
and you don't want to have it everywhere

1490
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,960
just FYI

1491
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,579
thanks

1492
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:27,680
uh rudiger folk is remote

1493
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,220
can you

1494
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,619
say okay maybe

1495
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:48,960
I okay I think I'm being hurt now uh

1496
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,420
uh kind of interesting stuff

1497
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:59,940
when I inch when I got around to work on

1498
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,119
the large communities for my

1499
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,619
uh

1500
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:07,200
policy definition and configuration

1501
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,020
generator system

1502
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:14,099
um I invented something and got it

1503
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,738
implemented that I called Community

1504
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:18,859
registry

1505
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:21,238
uh actually

1506
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:24,920
I think uh almost all

1507
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,520
uh points that Jared was mentioning

1508
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,640
uh were covered

1509
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,620
uh actually there is even the

1510
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,100
documentation in our uh internet draft

1511
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,600
form but uh I have been told uh the

1512
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,060
complexity of the whole system

1513
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,439
and to a specific application

1514
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:52,500
uh is really confusing so that internet

1515
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,040
draft form cannot be really used to

1516
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,000
share

1517
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,839
uh the main characteristics of the

1518
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:03,140
community registry

1519
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,479
are

1520
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:09,560
the presentation instead of doing Json

1521
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,219
is uh it looks a little bit like uh say

1522
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:15,738
domain name

1523
01:09:15,738 --> 01:09:19,920
uh notation or similar stuff where you

1524
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,439
can put in symbols and parameters into a

1525
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,060
structured string

1526
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,259
and you have an XML definition

1527
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:37,439
of how the community feels uh

1528
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,399
uh are defined

1529
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:45,500
and you can put you can uh even

1530
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:50,460
uh generate the regular Expressions used

1531
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,500
in vendor

1532
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,140
uh policy languages

1533
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,360
for matching

1534
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,860
uh

1535
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:02,640
simple communities or sets of

1536
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,719
communities or communities with some of

1537
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,739
the used parameters wildcarded

1538
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:11,400
um

1539
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,020
and

1540
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,679
as far as I can tell I think that is

1541
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,179
still working

1542
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:22,920
and about the only major thing that has

1543
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,739
been mentioned in the discussion uh

1544
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:27,420
right now

1545
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,900
uh that I think uh has been missing

1546
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,560
in

1547
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,960
our work was that yes we did not address

1548
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,800
uh how to make a a system for Global

1549
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,800
access to definitions uh thou in fact

1550
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,239
uh kind of that would probably fairly

1551
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,159
easy

1552
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:59,159
easily uh fit into the XML that Ariana

1553
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:03,120
is using for its registry

1554
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,080
um

1555
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:12,320
uh I'll try I'll try to uh pull out uh

1556
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,600
some easy

1557
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:20,580
uh stuff from the old documentation and

1558
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:23,060
share that and people who are interested

1559
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,300
uh uh probably should bother me in

1560
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,520
private email

1561
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,600
um

1562
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,320
uh yeah well okay just as a report so

1563
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,100
far though no Jason would happen or did

1564
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:42,780
happen in that that was XML based uh and

1565
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,860
uh

1566
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,620
uh

1567
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:49,800
uh yeah well okay so much uh to tell

1568
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,440
thanks

1569
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,420
all right thank you uh we would

1570
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,820
definitely be interested to uh to look

1571
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,500
at that to see if we can learn from it

1572
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,800
and not reinvent uh the wheel or make

1573
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,380
mistakes that maybe were made there

1574
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,860
thanks

1575
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,460
sorry it's Chris Morrow

1576
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,219
Google uh I have a question

1577
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:15,960
have you looked at I mean the

1578
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,360
community's Json thing is interesting I

1579
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,060
think ahmed's point about perhaps the

1580
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,840
larger bgpe message as some standardized

1581
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,320
form other than binary bgp data would be

1582
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,300
useful as well

1583
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,239
we ingested all of the route views data

1584
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:34,800
and put it into bigquery and in that

1585
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,920
process converted it to Json kind of

1586
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,199
on our own I don't know that we picked a

1587
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:43,260
particularly terrific format for that

1588
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,420
but if there was a standard format we

1589
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:46,860
could just go

1590
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,080
redo it to make it useful our point

1591
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,480
where our project was really to make the

1592
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,400
data available to researchers

1593
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,980
uh in a fashion that didn't involve them

1594
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,960
having to download it all

1595
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,820
parsed into something and then do

1596
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,320
something else with it

1597
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,420
so

1598
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,100
some

1599
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,100
more General conversion would be helpful

1600
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,600
I think also if it was standardized

1601
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,140
would be helpful

1602
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,580
okay thanks for the presentation too

1603
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,480
Jeff

1604
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,820
Jeff is hey Chris just as a follow-up to

1605
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,260
your point

1606
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,840
I I don't no I don't think it's quite in

1607
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,040
the scope for what we're looking at

1608
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,159
specifically for this presentation uh so

1609
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:30,420
what you're sort of talking about is

1610
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,340
it'd be sort of nice for

1611
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,840
things like you know like the prior

1612
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,179
presentation redis Costco know what pick

1613
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:37,699
whatever your bus happens to be for

1614
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:40,500
throwing bgp State at something that

1615
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,480
needs to catch it of having consistent

1616
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,340
naming for the fields uh it would make

1617
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,620
you know like even MRT parsing program

1618
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,120
is a little bit nicer that sort of thing

1619
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,400
so that all the schemas can be folded

1620
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,239
together

1621
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:53,940
this is sort of an interesting related

1622
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,340
piece there which is once you have

1623
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,500
parsed out components like communities

1624
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,620
or as numbers or whatever having a

1625
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,199
consistent uh mapping component where

1626
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:06,659
something says here's what this means

1627
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,159
you know as numbers you can point to

1628
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,560
like the who is Data or what they claim

1629
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,000
their network name means and I'm sure

1630
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,380
you probably fold that stuff at the back

1631
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:16,080
end yourselves so this is the same sort

1632
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,179
of thing of you know what would you do

1633
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:19,560
with a

1634
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,360
operator to find thing like a community

1635
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,980
extended Community especially for like

1636
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,659
VPN context

1637
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:25,860
um

1638
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,600
some of the best stuff that we're seeing

1639
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,760
you know in terms of uh user-defined

1640
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,880
data having a more generic format to try

1641
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,400
to unfold that into a user printable

1642
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,659
component

1643
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:37,980
uh

1644
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,500
I think if that's your goal as well and

1645
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,800
this impacts the discussion here is part

1646
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,320
of the challenge will be

1647
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,520
internationalization components to this

1648
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,820
so if you say here's a definition file

1649
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,580
for communities uh part of the

1650
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,320
requirements discussions I've had with

1651
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,300
other people and other contexts is how

1652
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,000
do you provide multiplicity for some of

1653
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,280
the fields like a description so here's

1654
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,560
the English version of this string maybe

1655
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,719
you want this also in a native language

1656
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,219
now for the operator as well

1657
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,980
thanks

1658
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,080
Jared do you want to take a mic over

1659
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,040
so it seems there is a good amount of

1660
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,800
interest to explore their space and

1661
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,739
everybody has opinions on

1662
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:40,040
almost every aspect of

1663
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,620
this proposal

1664
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:46,560
which to me means this this is a good

1665
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,880
candidate to to take on uh as as work

1666
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,260
with the goal of making it a working

1667
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,360
group document

1668
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,320
um

1669
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,420
sorry

1670
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,300
exactly that small detail

1671
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,520
I'll make the logo you guys do the

1672
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,620
internet draft

1673
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,420
um no but really uh Martin I would

1674
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,640
encourage you to to write an internet

1675
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,260
draft and submit it to the working group

1676
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,480
for consideration and

1677
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,780
um I I think the time is ripe to to try

1678
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,300
to standardize mapping Community Values

1679
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,199
to

1680
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,179
human readable text

1681
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:22,500
um

1682
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,199
cool thank you thank you

1683
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,719
and with that we have almost reached the

1684
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,420
end of our growth session uh I noticed

1685
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:36,300
that I forgot a small agenda item uh I

1686
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,820
was going to go over uh drafts that are

1687
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,800
in flight but then I didn't actually go

1688
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,840
over those

1689
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,679
um

1690
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:47,460
we have one ongoing uh call for working

1691
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:50,719
