1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,979
huh

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,520
okay

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,178
now ask me for sure

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,320
you're ready to go

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,939
all right after a two-minute launch

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,880
today we are ready to rock and roll uh

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,980
let me welcome Kevin uh who will be here

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,660
with us in the room to represent project

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,520
Callisto an extraterrestrial

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
collaboration with webrtc and everyone

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,660
if you're in this room and you are part

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,640
of the RTC web working group raise your

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,860
hand

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,660
okay so several people

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,260
um

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,840
cool other codec and other friendly

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,960
people here take it away

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,539
thanks Ted uh it's an honor for me to be

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,820
here speaking to all of you uh esteemed

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,559
internet engineering task force members

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,539
thank you for having me I'm Kevin I'm

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,000
with Cisco and I wanted to share with

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,420
you a brief version of the story of how

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,360
we came to participate in Project

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,180
Callisto we partnered with Lockheed

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,080
Martin

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,880
together with other companies in the

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,780
industry like Amazon with their Alexa

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,840
Technologies and Apple iPad Technologies

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,880
um to try to solve the problem of

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,180
real-time or as real time as we can do

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,939
given the latencies communications in

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,860
deep space exploration

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,220
and I want to give credit to the the

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,560
folks who

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,960
worked on this implementation and uh and

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,220
built the original version of this

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,320
presentation

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,240
um I'm just here to share it with you

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,920
all

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,700
so what is Project Callisto it's a

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,060
technology package on board the Orion

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,200
spacecraft to test the viability of

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,540
commercial Technologies in space

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,860
exploration

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,439
uh and I mentioned those Technologies

47
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,320
already as WebEx by Cisco Amazon Alexa

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,459
an Apple iPad tablet mounted inside the

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,660
Orion spacecraft to allow future manned

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,520
or crude excuse me crude uh

51
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,180
space missions to collaborate in near

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,819
Real Time with folks on the ground

53
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,980
and Orion is the deep space exploration

54
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,260
spacecraft built by Lockheed Martin and

55
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,280
Artemis is this series of missions to

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,500
fly that spacecraft to the moon and

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,319
ultimately to land on the moon and to

58
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,260
perform Moon exploration and and

59
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,459
ultimately Mars uh exploration

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,060
okay sure thank you

61
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,040
um you can scan that QR code up at the

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
Top If you want to learn more or go to

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,940
that URL and sing tiny font up in the

64
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,140
top right hand corner Lockheed

65
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,239
martin.com

66
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,500
and find the Callisto page there

67
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,420
so Artemis one is the first of the

68
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,680
Artemis missions that will launch from

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,540
Kennedy Space Center now targeting

70
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,599
November 16th launch window at 1am

71
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,480
Eastern time that's 6 a.m here in London

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,860
for those of us uh that live here and it

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,379
will circumnavigate the moon and return

74
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,700
to Earth as a test flight of the system

75
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,400
we're all super excited and crossing our

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,200
fingers that that November 16th date

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,480
holds

78
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,420
they've been monitoring uh the uh

79
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,120
hurricane weather and there's they've

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,760
had a few uh resets on the on the

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,920
calendar but November 16th is the the

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,480
current scheduled launch date so we'll

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,440
see if that happens

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,580
and the challenge that we were asked to

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,780
solve is real-time video HD

86
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,700
collaboration in space

87
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,560
and there was as you can imagine a few

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
technical challenges

89
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,000
the first one is It's a Long Way to the

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Moon you know our industry standard is

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,459
300 milliseconds round trip for

92
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,680
real-time collaboration

93
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,080
uh with project Callisto we were asked

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,680
to engineer it to up to 20 seconds or 20

95
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,080
000 milliseconds round trip which is uh

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,880
awfully a long time in the world of

97
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,620
Video Communications as those of you who

98
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,360
work on video now

99
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,580
and if you want to see what

100
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,120
to 20 000 milliseconds looks like uh

101
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,160
oh this is not a build slide I lost my

102
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,720
builds because I converted it to PDF

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,600
never mind the PowerPoint version that

104
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
line draws out over 20 seconds so you

105
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,979
can kind of experience it

106
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,320
so obviously the questions are are we

107
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,880
going to have delays in the various

108
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,699
protocols not only at the video

109
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,759
bitstream layer in our av1 codec but

110
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,340
also in protocols you know setting up

111
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,639
signaling uh you know connecting the

112
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,199
Call Etc

113
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,020
and how effective are our error

114
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,600
resilience and Recovery techniques going

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,639
to be in the face of these huge

116
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,560
latencies and packet loss and Jitter

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,039
thank you

118
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,080
I've got seven seconds remaining

119
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,280
what does that mean

120
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,340
s

121
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,660
oh

122
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,539
thank you Ted okay thank you yeah do

123
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,740
that do that okay well there we go

124
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,720
so this is how long it takes to send a

125
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,100
video frame

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,320
from the Earth to the

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,440
moonlander and respond right

128
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,979
awesome thanks for the demo tape

129
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,400
so the second problem is the satellite

130
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,820
network has pacquelos and Jitter and

131
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,620
very low bit rates so it's an

132
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,340
asynchronous network of 200 kilobits per

133
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,580
second Upstream from the ground to Orion

134
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,400
and one megabit down from Orion to the

135
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,639
ground and of that 200 200 milliseconds

136
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,740
160k of that is video

137
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,240
and 40K of that is audio so you know

138
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,699
that's a challenge how do we get high

139
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,620
definition 30 frames per second video to

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,680
work at 160 kilobits per second

141
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
um and there's also pack of loss and

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,199
Jitter to contend with

143
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,100
the third problem is the first Artemis

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,460
Mission Artemis one is an uncrewed

145
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,539
flight there's no humans on the thing to

146
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,000
to touch the iPad and launch the app and

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,280
place the call and all of that stuff so

148
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,380
how in the world are we gonna solve that

149
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,819
you know how are we going to launch the

150
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,919
application how's the application going

151
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,800
to know when to join the call how you

152
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,300
know what happens if the app crashes

153
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,880
what happens if a pop-up gets in the way

154
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,560
of the application

155
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,220
um

156
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,639
and so there's nobody to touch it and

157
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,259
there's no you know we couldn't use

158
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,259
Audible commands either because our

159
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,240
system is the thing that is receiving

160
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,400
audio from the ground playing it out of

161
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,759
our speaker uh on the iPad tablet and

162
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,139
then you know we could try to Loop that

163
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,520
back into the microphone I suppose but

164
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,319
like what what we have we would have to

165
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,520
have a call up in order to have that

166
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,699
pathway established so like uh so we had

167
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,759
to come up with clever uh Technologies

168
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,919
for that our clever techniques to solve

169
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:47,940
that problem

170
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,800
so our solution

171
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,699
was to build a custom version of our

172
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,259
WebEx app

173
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,380
highly customized for this mission

174
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,979
and we built a new protocol translation

175
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,919
server that sits on a container

176
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,319
co-resident with our conferencing server

177
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,580
on the ground that we called the ground

178
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,560
control server

179
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,599
and we implemented a new UDP based

180
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,220
signaling protocol that gave us a single

181
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,620
round trip transaction

182
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,680
request response to join the call

183
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,960
eliminating all of the normal TCP and

184
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,900
TLS handshaking and multiple round trips

185
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,059
to get a call up

186
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,059
and that protocol converter simply

187
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,240
converted that new UDP protocol that we

188
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,580
implemented to the normal standard

189
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,700
webrtc HTTP websocket based

190
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,160
Communications protocol that we do

191
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,640
normally on our server for our normal

192
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,220
application

193
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,820
and we set up a simulated network of 20

194
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,560
milliseconds of latency and pack a loss

195
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,140
and Jitter and surprisingly it just

196
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,519
worked like out of the box we were

197
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,740
shocked except

198
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,680
uh h.264 video Codec kind of fell apart

199
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,019
at these low bit rates and looked pretty

200
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,040
bad

201
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
so we introduced ab1 into the project

202
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,899
which we had wanted to do but we tested

203
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,660
it with 264 before

204
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,220
moving forward with ab1 so we said yep

205
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,920
okay confirmed 264 is not going to work

206
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,839
let's let's go ahead and Implement

207
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,459
everyone

208
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,300
so

209
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,399
uh just a few words about ab1 I'm sure

210
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,380
many of you in the room are aware of it

211
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,600
uh and many of you I'm sure have

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,040
contributed to it

213
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,300
but av1 is a new video Codec designed by

214
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,160
the alliance for open media which was uh

215
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
sponsored by several companies but three

216
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
of those were Google Cisco and Mozilla

217
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
contributing our very our respective

218
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
video Codec Technologies into this

219
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,279
effort to produce a codec that would be

220
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,480
as good or better as h.265 while being

221
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,480
open source and royalty free and you can

222
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,519
read more about it at the uh you can

223
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,100
read more about our

224
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,720
contribution to that at that link down

225
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,779
at the bottom and I just want to shout

226
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,459
out Jonathan Rosenberg in the room here

227
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,279
for uh initiating and leading this

228
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,839
effort when when you're at Cisco thank

229
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,320
you Jonathan

230
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,580
um so we have our own implementation of

231
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,160
the Cisco av1 codec and that's primarily

232
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,380
because the aom version is not super

233
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,920
optimized for real time low latency

234
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,060
bi-directional video conferencing

235
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,459
real-time communication so we have our

236
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,700
own implementation of the av1 encoder

237
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,600
developed by colleagues in UK uh uh

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,300
Norway and China

239
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,680
and highly optimized for real-time

240
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,279
latency sensitive Communications for

241
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,320
decoding we use the open source davit

242
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
decoder from video land that was adopted

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,560
by aom

244
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,040
and that gives us these uh our

245
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,640
implementation gives us about 30 percent

246
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,519
uh better compression or 30 less bit

247
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,240
rate at uh the same complexity or the

248
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,820
same CPU consumption as our reference

249
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,320
open h.264 codec that we uh publish and

250
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,360
lots of other companies use

251
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,820
and we've integrated av1 into our WebEx

252
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,720
product in WebEx meetings and uh we also

253
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,820
implemented it into this custom version

254
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,519
of the WebEx app and the server the

255
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,339
conferencing server that we created for

256
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,540
this project callista

257
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,800
so what were the challenges and

258
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,500
solutions at the video Codec bitstream

259
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,000
level that we had to solve so first of

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
all it had to have great quality or at

261
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,440
least good quality at extremely low bit

262
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,660
rate 160 kilobits per second and to

263
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,040
solve that av1 itself has inherently uh

264
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,860
in it you know lots of tools and

265
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,839
techniques for getting pretty decent

266
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,420
quality at very low bit rates like quad

267
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,779
tree super blocks and context adaptive

268
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,940
entropy coding and various other

269
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,540
techniques so we employed all of those

270
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,959
Second Challenge is the huge latency up

271
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,700
to 10 seconds in each Direction so

272
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,140
obviously

273
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,399
uh packet loss requesting a keyframe uh

274
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,740
is not going to work so we just simply

275
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,660
ignore keyframe requests and we generate

276
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,240
keyframes periodically

277
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,399
um and then there's packet loss so we

278
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,740
implemented normally and I really

279
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,480
enjoyed Luke's presentation earlier

280
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,000
about quick over media

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,680
uh so if you guys attended that this

282
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,220
morning then you remember the IPP or IP

283
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,740
BP you know Gap structure that Luke

284
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,980
talked about so we implemented a a

285
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,660
broadcast like Gap structure with

286
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,019
discardable keyframes

287
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,019
and uh to make it more resilient to

288
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,779
pacalas and then the problem of

289
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,420
keyframes being traditionally very large

290
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,560
and subject to being just uh corrupted

291
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
by packet loss in in transit we

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,680
downscale have to half the resolution

293
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,839
then encode and then upscale on the

294
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,139
other end when we decode and and we also

295
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,519
allow the quality to kind of kind of

296
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,040
build up over several frames if there's

297
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,079
not a lot of motion in the video

298
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,779
and the server and the app switch

299
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,180
between normal mode and this error

300
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,500
resilient mode described on the right

301
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,200
hand side of the slide based on the

302
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,700
frequency of IDR requests so if we start

303
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,300
getting IDR requests we switch into this

304
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,160
resilient mode and then we switch back

305
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,720
out of it to try to increase quality

306
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,600
when IDR requests are not coming through

307
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,339
so we ignore them but we still get them

308
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,820
and we switch into this mode when as

309
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,180
needed

310
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,019
so uh lastly I'll just say that um the

311
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,800
no touching and no audio interface the

312
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,639
solution to that was a custom uh like

313
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,639
MDM like uh thing that's sort of like

314
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,399
just a URL that says you know push this

315
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,940
URL to the to the OS and it will launch

316
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,680
the app and then we just automatically

317
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,120
join a predetermined meeting URI so

318
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,620
that's how we solve the the no

319
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,300
interaction problem

320
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,220
and I just wanted to close with giving

321
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,339
credit to my colleagues who contributed

322
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,959
to this I was the director of

323
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,779
engineering at the time uh and Thomas

324
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,899
and Dimitri and Alex on our team worked

325
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,420
on this together with many other uh

326
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,320
Engineers uh at Cisco and our colleagues

327
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
at Lockheed Martin so just wanted to say

328
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,500
thanks to all of them for making this

329
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,600
reality and fingers crossed this thing

330
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,820
Launches on November 16th thank you for

331
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,860
having me

332
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:09,799
[Applause]

333
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,600
the cues are open so if you can please

334
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,100
use the tool I realized it was a little

335
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,740
bit hard for people uh because the

336
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,620
because of the URL uh problem on the

337
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,180
agenda

338
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,579
um but uh if you if you can't get into

339
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,079
the tool you can get in line and we'll

340
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,420
recognize you anyway but uh if you could

341
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,279
use the tool to to form a queue that'd

342
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,060
be great

343
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,500
uh Darren Dukes your first

344
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,579
yeah um so what was that what was that

345
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,820
user experience at 10 second delay you

346
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,339
know in One Direction is that going to

347
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,199
be a usable thing for when you tried it

348
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
in the labs we did yeah that's a good

349
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,160
question it is you know to be honest

350
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,320
it's a bit of a walkie-talkie kind of

351
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,940
mode

352
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,980
um you you certainly can't interrupt

353
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,199
each other uh like you can on a normal

354
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,320
video conference uh even in normal video

355
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
conferencing interrupting is you know

356
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,980
you can accidentally step on each other

357
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,600
because of the end latency here that's

358
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,940
just exacerbated right that you really

359
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,800
need to kind of wait and let them finish

360
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,800
talking and uh before you try to speak

361
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,180
over them

362
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,000
um but other than that it works great

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,100
and the uh it's not just video but it's

364
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,860
also real-time whiteboarding and and

365
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,300
content sharing I should have mentioned

366
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,579
that in the presentation so imagine you

367
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,440
know we could draw together it would

368
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,000
take a while for what you've drawn to

369
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,980
show up for me and what I've drawn to

370
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,100
show for you but it works conflict so in

371
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,540
those space movies where they've got you

372
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,040
know something's gone wrong and the

373
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
engineering team is figuring it out they

374
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
could like whiteboard the solution

375
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,680
exactly in somewhat slow real time yeah

376
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,500
exactly all right thanks thanks

377
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm sure yeah

378
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,740
uh I think that uh you you choose the uh

379
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,300
av1 over H2 264 is because it's very

380
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,459
efficient right yes yeah but H2 uh q65

381
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,280
is also very efficient so what's the

382
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,020
benefit

383
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,419
between everyone and yeah

384
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,240
yeah I think from our perspective and I

385
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,679
don't know that everyone in the industry

386
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,359
shares this perspective that from our

387
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,400
perspective at Cisco uh the challenge

388
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,059
with h.265 is the patent um okay uh

389
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,740
challenge right so

390
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,380
for us ab1 is is open source and free to

391
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,799
use and uh so it makes sense even if

392
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,600
they're roughly equivalent technically

393
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,439
thank you

394
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,660
Jonathan yeah I can't I've tried a

395
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,220
million times and I can't get on the

396
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,440
on-site queue so I apologize Jonathan

397
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,940
Rosenberg super happy to see this this

398
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,320
is awesome

399
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,660
um normally there's a trade-off for

400
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,220
video encoding between computational

401
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,039
complexity and bandwidth uh and so to

402
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,380
get the bandwidth down you know you

403
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,120
could do a lot more work on the encoder

404
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
side did you also have computational

405
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
constraints but it's computational

406
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,820
complexity leads to I guess weight or

407
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,160
power or something that are all

408
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,020
considerations in the moon so what

409
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,299
what's the compute environment here

410
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,740
uh that's a good question I don't know

411
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,039
the details of the Apple iPad uh because

412
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,559
it's a it's an Apple iPad mounted inside

413
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,360
oh I missed that it's literally an iPad

414
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,340
it's literally an iPad Pro I thought

415
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,760
there was something

416
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,860
then I withdraw my questions all right

417
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,419
thank you

418
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,100
hahaha

419
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,020
yeah it's a it's a very customized

420
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,940
version of our IOS app running on

421
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,299
uh Darren

422
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,600
uh yeah so just uh just maybe

423
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,740
um

424
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,740
one more with with the uh protocol that

425
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,500
you'd invented the the UDP based one to

426
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,360
get to the spacecraft uh do you see are

427
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,860
there any advantages to that did you

428
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,539
kind of discover anything interesting

429
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,640
with having to come up with that is it

430
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,960
usable outside of this use case

431
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,179
uh that's a great question actually that

432
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,919
I guess from our perspective we didn't

433
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,260
think that it was usable outside of this

434
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,620
very constrained use case because you

435
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,179
know we basically are doing you know we

436
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,900
disabled srtp we disabled TLS you know

437
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,480
so not the kind of thing we would

438
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
normally recommend you know customers to

439
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,660
do

440
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,380
um

441
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,380
so it was very like purpose Built For

442
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,960
This closed Network system

443
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,140
where confidentiality and and data

444
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,820
integrity and all that are less of a con

445
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,940
concern okay and it just there was a

446
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,820
previous uh group a boss that was in

447
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,500
where we were talking about you know low

448
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,059
power stuff and you know uh particularly

449
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,100
um things that were time sensitive as to

450
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,480
how much bandwidth was available and

451
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,520
whatnot it'd be kind of interesting if

452
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,020
you were to build up from what you got

453
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,320
to with that and minimally add back to

454
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,600
it what you'd end up with that could be

455
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,220
very low bandwidth but still have that

456
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,780
high quality in order to reach those

457
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,179
kind of rural areas yeah maybe on the

458
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,860
moon but yeah it made me feel like the

459
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,940
moon so it's an interesting question

460
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,880
yeah thanks yeah because I do think that

461
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,500
there's a huge opportunity there and

462
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,960
like you know remote farming communities

463
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,860
or or other places where you're yeah

464
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,480
near Earth orbit satellite networks and

465
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,960
being able to do really low round trip

466
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,940
transmission yeah Communications yeah

467
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,520
yeah I'm from more Northern ish Canada

468
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,980
not very Northern Canada but to yeah

469
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,840
once you get outside of the cell ranges

470
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
right there's not a lot of bandwidth

471
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,100
right yeah thanks okay

472
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,820
Alyssa

473
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,200
hi Alyssa hey nice to see you good to

474
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,460
see you thanks

475
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,760
um can you talk a little bit about the

476
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,700
the limitations in terms of the features

477
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,919
and conferencing like could you have two

478
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,600
people on the ground joining a

479
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,059
conference with the moon like like in

480
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,919
terms of our normal typical experience

481
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,780
of video conferencing like what's

482
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,840
available in this context versus what we

483
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,299
are accustomed to is terrestrial users

484
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,679
of WebEx I love that you ask that

485
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,820
question because I should have mentioned

486
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,799
it on the slide but because I lost the

487
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,919
build I kind of maybe missed some points

488
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:17,760
um

489
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,820
so on the ground they have normal WebEx

490
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,480
devices and like our board and our room

491
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,260
systems and our desktop systems like the

492
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,860
um

493
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,220
uh The Desk Pro for example and they're

494
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,200
they're all connected in a conference

495
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,980
with the Orion uh

496
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,340
spacecraft right so they can all have

497
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,080
you know be having a real-time meeting

498
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,440
and the application that I believe NASA

499
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,600
wants to use it for is to invite you

500
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,900
know students kids other people from the

501
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,299
public into

502
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,760
their Ground Control uh

503
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,100
facility to

504
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,740
experience this and actually collaborate

505
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,780
with astronauts

506
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,880
um which is pretty cool yeah yeah that's

507
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,340
awesome thanks

508
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,059
Juan Carlos

509
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,820
yeah so

510
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,419
I was curious because this is definitely

511
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,179
very interesting uh first use case and

512
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,940
looking into the future uh

513
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,400
we probably will face situations where

514
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,900
we will not have line of sight right

515
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,179
because this is the first time to the

516
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,440
Moon

517
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,480
the yeah it's right around the back side

518
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,520
go around and even further into the

519
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,140
future right you can think of Mars and

520
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,419
that's when normally Leo and stuff like

521
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,340
that right will come into picture when

522
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,799
so that we can

523
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
work when there are situations when

524
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,760
there's no line of sight in which cases

525
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,380
most likely there will be satellite

526
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,600
relays right so

527
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,580
have you thought or do you have any idea

528
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,900
in this case you showed that

529
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,140
architecture showing the proxy how you

530
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,659
simplify the the signaling uh onto the

531
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,080
space station but uh if ever we put more

532
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,240
relays or an Leo satellite network with

533
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,320
that

534
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,900
also work or have you guys thought about

535
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,580
that multi-hop

536
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,740
architecture that is a really good

537
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,960
question and and we didn't because we

538
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,580
didn't actually have a lot of detail

539
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,179
from NASA about the in in trick you know

540
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,159
the the inside details of how their

541
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,960
network works but it is a satellite

542
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,120
relay based Network which is why the

543
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,500
latencies are up to 20 seconds because

544
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,880
the average distance from the Earth to

545
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,500
the Moon is much less than 20 seconds

546
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,559
it's like three but they said you need

547
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,940
to engineer for up to 20 seconds and

548
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,020
that's because it's going to be bouncing

549
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,580
off these satellites when it's like on

550
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,500
around the back side of the moon it has

551
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,820
to hit a satellite before it comes to

552
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,280
the Earth and so forth so but I I'm not

553
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,980
as familiar with the you know the

554
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,320
underlying details of how that satellite

555
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,760
network works and what we could do to

556
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,039
optimize it further so okay so there is

557
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,500
already multiple relays yeah let's

558
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,360
extract the risk of release it goes from

559
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,299
their near-earth uh satellite Network to

560
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,760
their deep space satellite Network as as

561
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,940
it as it goes out further away to the

562
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,320
Moon I think it switches to their deep

563
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,640
space Network

564
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,679
but you don't know how many hops to to I

565
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,780
don't know how many miles no

566
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,299
yeah

567
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,100
yeah

568
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,840
thank you you just you got you just

569
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,100
answered my question because I was

570
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,320
curious how the 20 seconds do come into

571
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,720
place how they would decompose given the

572
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,860
architecture you showed in the beginning

573
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,559
yeah so so it's it's multiple realize

574
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,840
they are further out and and Bridge loud

575
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,880
distances and there's just no not an

576
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,400
easy shortest path yeah exactly okay

577
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
would there be any details on that

578
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,640
available at some point Sorry would

579
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,919
there be any details on that structure

580
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,140
available at some point let's just be

581
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,299
curious yeah we're super curious too

582
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,679
those details would have to come from

583
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,260
Lockheed and from NASA we were asked not

584
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,720
to I mean they didn't share it was sort

585
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,159
of like they shared with us what we

586
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,179
needed to know and and nothing more

587
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,440
okay understood and I had to get

588
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,720
permission to give this presentation

589
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,220
because even this amount of detail is

590
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,320
more than we had previously disclosed in

591
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,340
our uh you know respective marketing

592
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,080
announcements and stuff so I had to go

593
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,580
to them and ask for permission to share

594
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,640
this with you all right cool thanks yeah

595
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,480
oh yeah John Lennox like maybe you know

596
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,820
when your comment about that tells me

597
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,900
you know and someone asked me because

598
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,980
then I asked you've mentioned you

599
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,760
disabled all the TLs and srtp was that

600
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,380
just for practicality or was that a

601
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,539
policy like you know we want you know

602
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,860
people on the ground other people on the

603
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,179
ground people to watch it

604
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,940
live or no is they uh that's a good

605
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,100
question the disabling of TLS was for

606
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,020
practical reasoning out to eliminate the

607
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,000
rent multiple round trips and eliminate

608
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,100
TCP and go with UDP

609
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,200
um but for srtp that was simply a

610
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,580
convenience thing that's like well we

611
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,919
don't need it it's an enclosed almost

612
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,500
like a closed circuit television kind of

613
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,120
network you know it's not connected to

614
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,799
the internet at all uh they're only

615
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,360
wondering and if you had any

616
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,860
thought maybe this isn't directly what

617
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,880
you're working on we had any thoughts

618
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,679
like if you did need to encrypt it how

619
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,140
would you do keying when you have a 20

620
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,360
second latency yeah exactly and like

621
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,039
rollover counters and stuff like that

622
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,720
come into play right did you have any

623
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,100
thoughts about that or just you turned

624
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,960
it off yeah we just no we didn't think

625
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,220
through that very hard we're just like

626
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,960
oh we don't need srtp we'll just disable

627
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,580
it and then so therefore we didn't have

628
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,380
to worry about rollover counters you

629
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,820
know so so we'll point out that if we

630
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,020
were doing this super quick you could do

631
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,360
uh zero rtt resumption if you started

632
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,779
the sessions before they left the Earth

633
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,299
that then you'd always just be resuming

634
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,980
something that you already had

635
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,220
um uh set up with the tickets anyway um

636
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,620
oh uh sorry the something's wrong with

637
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,500
the um the in-room tools not letting a

638
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,900
lot of people in so uh yeah if I wasn't

639
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,340
clear about that if you can't get into

640
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,840
the tool you can't get in line it will

641
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,159
just recognize you from the line sorry

642
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,500
about that so um mosinati um just

643
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,059
wondering if uh so this was obviously

644
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,760
for Converse or for human to human use

645
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,400
but I assume that there's a lot of video

646
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,919
you know from you know Telemetry systems

647
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,200
coming back and maybe even you know

648
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,240
robotic control that's you know delayed

649
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,559
you know a lot of autonomous within 20

650
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,299
seconds but maybe human controlled

651
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,120
beyond that is this is some next steps

652
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,159
to maybe think about broadening this to

653
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,760
use this core real-time uh communication

654
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,279
technology to go across all the video

655
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,159
feeds all the or even any sensory feeds

656
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,900
not just the video but any kind of

657
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,760
sensory data that's streaming back to

658
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,980
ground stations and then maybe

659
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,779
something that has a 20 second you know

660
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,659
reaction time that could usefully

661
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,500
feedback and and change the sensory

662
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,179
systems is there any future work to look

663
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,580
at doing something like that I I don't

664
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,220
know we had speculated on some things

665
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,080
like that too like for example somebody

666
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,240
on the ground could say hey

667
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,640
um Alexa you know turn the lights on or

668
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,419
turn the music up or whatever

669
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:02,820
to the uh to the Alexa that's running in

670
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,340
the Orion spacecraft right

671
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,559
um and I don't know if this is true at

672
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,020
all this is a total rumor but uh I

673
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,120
thought that I understood that they also

674
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,520
had a GoPro mounted inside the

675
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,220
spacecraft pointing at the iPad so that

676
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,480
from the ground they could see what's

677
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,820
being displayed on the iPad so there are

678
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,860
other systems and then I don't know

679
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,799
about the actual spacecraft itself and

680
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,159
all of the Telemetry and instrumentation

681
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,840
and all of that on the spacecraft itself

682
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,279
I have known but this was a human to

683
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,440
human intent intended communication

684
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,340
right okay

685
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,500
um while you were talking I I wondered I

686
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,539
know some of these uh WebEx and things

687
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,880
have the ability to do

688
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,100
um closed caption real time do you use

689
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,779
the closed captioning in real time did

690
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,700
you try doing that because I think that

691
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,260
would be quite useful because of the

692
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,120
time delay being able to refer to the

693
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,380
text so

694
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,360
that that's a fantastic question and

695
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,220
there's a challenge with that which I

696
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,659
can't speak to authoritatively because

697
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,779
I'm not uh on the Amazon Alexa team but

698
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,000
they had the same challenge as that you

699
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,279
know normally the device is able to

700
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,200
interpret the Wake word

701
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,799
so but then all of the actual

702
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,760
um

703
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,799
you know automatic speech recognition

704
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,980
and all of that stuff is done back in in

705
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,080
the cloud well this system's a closed

706
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,059
system there is no Cloud there is no

707
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,460
back end so they had to build a custom

708
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,500
version my understanding is Amazon had

709
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,539
to build a custom version of Alexa to do

710
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,340
a lot of that locally

711
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,720
and we would have the same problem

712
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,120
within the WebEx app is for real-time

713
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
closed captioning and real-time

714
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,100
translation we rely on back-end systems

715
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,679
to do all of that ASR and text-to-speech

716
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,380
and natural language processing NLP and

717
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,200
so forth uh all of that would have to be

718
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,419
built into the app itself

719
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,760
or into the server on the ground and not

720
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,799
connected to the internet and you know

721
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,360
it's all of those dependencies would be

722
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,860
the the challenge that we would need to

723
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,899
solve

724
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,059
yeah

725
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,640
maybe in the future Mission they'll ask

726
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,720
us to to work on that

727
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,140
foreign

728
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,440
so um I'll take a moment then to thank

729
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,360
you again and I have to say uh I'm going

730
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,039
to reveal myself as very oh there's

731
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,919
somebody coming to the queue now

732
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,740
just just speak no worries okay sorry

733
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,299
um I just had a quick thought you said

734
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,299
that the terrestrial WebEx clients are

735
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,740
just normal ones right

736
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,320
so did you ever think about

737
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,779
um relaying the cloud processing through

738
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,760
those so that you can do all the

739
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,840
captioning of those kinds of extra

740
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,659
Services because those aren't in the

741
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,159
closed Network only I imagine they're

742
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,640
kind of fuel honed

743
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,919
so they are on the closed Network my

744
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,840
understanding so I think the entire

745
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,059
system is not connected to the internet

746
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,559
is what I

747
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,039
was led to understand oh uh so I think

748
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,200
it would still be a challenge to but but

749
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,419
yeah if you could

750
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,340
you know if those could be dual

751
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,799
interfaced with one leg and the NASA

752
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,720
Network and another leg connected to the

753
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,460
public internet then absolutely we could

754
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,899
do something like that yeah yeah

755
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,260
okay uh all right

756
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,700
I'll remember whether it was in your

757
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,919
slides but do you sort of look at FEC

758
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,500
for uh some of your Transmissions

759
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,659
because it seems like a

760
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,820
kind of useful thing you're right you

761
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,520
can't do arq for yeah you're right

762
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,740
that's a very good question and and we

763
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,559
should have we did not use FEC just for

764
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,600
this simple fact that we didn't

765
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,520
implement it in that custom version of

766
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,960
the app but you're right in normal WebEx

767
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
we absolutely use FEC and we also use

768
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,260
now RTX re-transmission uh and in

769
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,860
combination so like we can dynamically

770
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,299
switch between Forward Air correction

771
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,059
and RTX re-transmission and we can

772
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,340
protect the RTX packets so that the

773
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,100
re-transmissions have a higher chance of

774
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,380
getting through but we didn't have all

775
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,000
of that in this custom version of the

776
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,500
app so

777
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,779
but yeah maybe a future version of it if

778
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,000
if NASA asks us to be a part of Artemis

779
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,279
2 or Artemis 3 maybe we want to do that

780
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,840
because right effect would definitely be

781
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,779
useful I guess it's sort of to drive

782
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,640
that potentially one it might be useful

783
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,520
to understand what the loss patterns are

784
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,020
around the um

785
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,880
transmissions and what drives those

786
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,080
whether it's solar storms or uh weather

787
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,240
yeah or some other kind of space weather

788
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,340
that then you could maybe pull to the

789
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,980
level of FEC they're using depending on

790
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,720
whether there's a sunspot or something

791
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,980
like that yeah

792
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,140
yeah right yeah okay

793
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,120
okay uh so let me let me say thank you

794
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,700
and let me also say this is a wonderful

795
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,919
Blast from the Past for me my very first

796
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,640
ietf I was here is a representative of a

797
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,100
contractor to NASA um helping out with

798
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,500
uh the very very early days of the web

799
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,279
so uh seeing this work come here uh and

800
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,200
get talked about picking up some of the

801
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,779
work that was done here in webrtc uh

802
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,460
some of the work that uh many of the

803
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,019
companies here have contributed to an

804
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,019
ab1 and aomedia it's really great

805
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,419
um to see how far we've come and how

806
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,700
close it looks like uh the experience

807
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,559
they'll have and Artemis two and three

808
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,840
when they become crude missions uh to

809
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,880
what we can give our customers so that's

810
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,080
great thank you very much for coming

811
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,799
thank you Ted

812
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,019
all right

813
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:03,440
that was great thank you very much

814
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,780
well it's been a long time since I've

815
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,859
had to fight with lawyers
