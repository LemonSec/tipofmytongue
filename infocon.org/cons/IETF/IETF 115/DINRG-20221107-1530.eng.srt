1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,860
foreign

2
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,740
I think it's his time let's get it

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,980
started so uh this is a

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,220
King research group meeting

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,520
decentralized the internet

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,380
infrastructure

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,340
and uh

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,379
yeah I think I participated in the last

9
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,899
one this is actually my second thing RG

10
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,100
meeting

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,340
and uh we'll move on to the next one

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,820
um up front we will have some matters

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,180
yeah

14
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,079
maybe this is better

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,360
speakers can take off the mask

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,780
temporarily which is good um

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,140
so uh that's your role we're gonna first

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,200
go through a few who are not well

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,799
um

20
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,380
notifications so this is the RTF follow

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,580
the ietf intellectual property right

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,640
um by participating in the irtf

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,400
you follow those uh processes in the

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,420
policies

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,240
contributions if it's covered by the

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,079
patents you need to inform

27
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,159
the community

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,619
yeah and the file such as APR

29
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,200
disclosures in a timely manner

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,960
in the arkf prefers the most liberal

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,299
licensing terms

32
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,920
um you can look at the RFC 5378

33
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,240
and 8179 for more details next slides

you you can read as

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,880
as clearly as I could just read them

36

myself right personal informations you

37
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,379

attendee you agree to work respectively

41
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,160
with other participants

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
and

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,580
she's overseas for the code of conduct

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,040
next slide please

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,040
go for artf is a focused on the

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,620
longer-term research issues like this

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,340
one we're not really making standard but

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,599
uh

49
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,800
looking to uh addressing

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,340
you know Mara long-term

51
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,180
challenges

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,739
the RTF can publish informational

53
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:00,739
experimental documents in the RFC series

54
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,180
we're not going to produce a standard

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,019
making document next slice

56
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,040
so just the Turk and I are chairs of

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,800
this group and Turkish remote online I

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
think people can see him there

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,519
this meet meeting Note Taker so Dirk I

60
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,580
think we hired one volunteer or we still

61
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,620
need to get one

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,640
yes um so kindly Raymond has volunteered

63
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,860
um so Raymond are you in the meeting

64
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,920
um

65
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,640
what's what's her name I lost or

66
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,360
can we uh just get that one more

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,500
volunteers for note taking

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,099
anyone

69
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,299
yeah it looks like Raymond is not in not

70
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,819
in the meeting so um no I guess it's his

71
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,179
first time

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,480
thank you

73
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,879
we'll give one minute for everyone to

74
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
think about

75
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,140
whether you're willing to help

76
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
interesting so many people are

77
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,060
interested in attending but not

78
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,720
yeah okay

79
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,139
we got one volunteer I couldn't see the

80
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,320
name

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,180
okay let's move on

82
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,639
that's great thanks um if you if you

83
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,340
like you could take notes in the Hedge

84
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,860
talk document and there's a link in the

85
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,600
chat if you don't know whether it's

86
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,900
so uh this is just recap of what

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,440
happened at ietf

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,100
uh Philadelphia where

89
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
uh we put the pointer there for whoever

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,340
wants to uh refresh your memory all the

91
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,460
materials of that meeting over there I

92
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,020
think that essentially

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,500
I give a report on this Workshop thing

94
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,300
RG conducted in June 2021 uh

95
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,460
and I think

96
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,120
the two major points

97
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,220
we extract out from that very

98
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,080
interesting Workshop

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,800
is the following that is the really two

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,960
major factors

101
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,720
We Believe

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,900
that have driven to this internet

103
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,259
well driven the internet from previously

104
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,419
more or less uh

105
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,340
I would say decentralized the

106
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,560
infrastructure into where we are today

107
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,560
is is largely centralized

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,759
I think one is economy of scale that no

109
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,120
one can deny that the cloud

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,860
services

111
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,860
really benefited from that factor

112
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,440
but we also believe from the workshop

113
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,340
discussions that another factor it's

114
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,400
it's about equally played equally

115
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,199
important role

116
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,979
in the internet centralization is

117
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,160
the lacking of effective Security

118
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
Solutions

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,919
and that have driven people

120
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,100
into the clouds so that with the thick

121
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,780
uh

122
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,280
walls of the castle people somehow you

123
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,740
know put their web services and other

124
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,979
services into the clouds because

125
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,660
individually

126
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,539
one doesn't really have the power

127
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,319
to mitigate like the scale

128
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,419
uh and then the

129
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,020
the strengths of today's deny of service

130
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,020
attacks

131
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,280
of course this is just from the workshop

132
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,020
discussions uh further discussions will

133
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,919
be needed and then the next main point

134
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,620
we took away from the last meeting is

135
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,819
that uh

136
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,680
that the people

137
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,380
by the large agreed

138
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,800
we can use the visiting RG

139
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,539
as a forum uh to other focal points to

140
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,599
collect the future inputs and

141
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,960
um run discussions so that it's more or

142
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,120
less

143
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,880
organized more better organized effort

144
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,780
as opposed to previously we have a long

145
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,680
list

146
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,460
of Internet drafts around this area this

147
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,220
challenging topic but uh you know

148
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,460
scattered in different places as

149
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,280
individual submissions I think drg now

150
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,360
would agree to uh be the host of those

151
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,479
the home for those discussions next

152
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,580
slides

153
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,479
so moving forward uh since the

154
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,860
Philadelphia we received multiple inputs

155
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,620
individual messages here and there and

156
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,259
also see in the global

157
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,319
broader interest product community that

158
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,660
those growing interest in addressing

159
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,159
these challenges so today we focus on

160
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,659
this uh

161
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,779
the second task we collected from

162
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,559
Philadelphia that is beginning the the

163
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,098
very first

164
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,740
kind of a

165
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,580
discussion we'll have five presentations

166
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,940
that covers a broad area looking at the

167
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,880
centralization or Mitigation Of The

168
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,000
centralization from different angles we

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,399
hope that today's discussion will really

170
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,899
trigger the group of gpn and therefore

171
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,779
helping moving the effort forward

172
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,399
and then

173
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,680
I hope we still have time at the end

174
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,380
we're going to discuss about the drg

175
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,800
charter updates given that the charter

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,080
was written several years back

177
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,360
now our understanding of the problem

178
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,540
space have changed in a significant way

179
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,700
so by the end

180
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,300
um turkey will lead that discussion

181
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,120
we prepared that this discussion may not

182
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,279
have enough time to finish we only have

183
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,640
two hours here so we scheduled a set

184
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,399
meeting on Wednesday

185
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,860
we know that not everyone would be able

186
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,080
to make that time slot given this last

187
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,640
minute

188
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,660
the plugin but that Turk and I will try

189
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,060
to draft something after today's

190
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,760
discussion so that we can conduct the

191
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,720
conversation about the charter app

192
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,899
updates over email and uh continue on to

193
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,660
the Wednesday so uh that's the end of my

194
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,480
10 minutes I think I'm right on time and

195
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,360
our next one will be Mark sitting right

196
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,580
here you can draw your own presentation

197
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
thank you let me bring the slides up

198
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,779
here

199
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,920
okay

200
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,500
let's see I'm gonna do it from here

201
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,540
rather than stand up

202
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,279
uh so I

203
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,339
um I have to sort of add to the

204
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,720
contributions here uh I've authored uh a

205
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,899
draft based on the conversations that we

206
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,720
had in Philadelphia and also in the

207
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,100
workshop

208
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,560
um let me sort of bring up a little bit

209
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,200
of context here I think we know about

210
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,079
the word taxonomy this is not where I'm

211
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,439
headed

212
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,899
our understanding of taxonomy when we

213
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,660
were learning uh in in early school days

214
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,600
is something that is a complex hierarchy

215
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,500
of organizing organizing information

216
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,480
that's really not where I'm headed here

217
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,820
um but I wanted to remind you of the

218
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,800
uses of that word

219
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,500
um in in my case

220
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,140
um the word taxonomy is something that

221
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,260
is actually suggested by the authors of

222
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,180
the workshop report on centralization

223
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,820
they actually uh have a paragraph in the

224
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,040
workshop report that basically talks

225
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,920
about this issue and let me uh put it

226
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,339
into sort of a very simple English here

227
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,680
if you have four people who are looking

228
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,959
at a work of Modern Art you have

229
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,820
probably they're seeing four different

230
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,339
things right if you have four people

231
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,680
taking a Rorschach test they're going to

232
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,060
tell you that there are different things

233
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,700
in each one of them and I believe that

234
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,140
one of the things that we learned from

235
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,180
Philadelphia is when you say the word

236
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,640
centralization it means different things

237
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,700
to different people it it just Rings a

238
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,740
different Bell and that's without making

239
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,500
any judgment about the validity of that

240
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
interpretation or the applicability I'm

241
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,320
not being judgmental on that at all I'm

242
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,260
saying simply that when people hear the

243
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,180
word centralization in the context of

244
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,339
the internet they think about different

245
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,500
things and when you think about the

246
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,800
goals that the irtf has I think that

247
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,980
further work and this work on the

248
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,959
taxonomy is in support of further work

249
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,839
further work on centralization

250
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
would actually benefit from a look at

251
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
particular facets of centralization not

252
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,579
trying to deal with it as a spread

253
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,980
Spectrum sort of topic but instead

254
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,459
thinking about specific specific work

255
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,639
and truly this taxonomy document is in

256
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,440
support of future work in the research

257
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,779
group right I'll tell you at the very

258
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,480
end that I have some other

259
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,760
personal interests in this as well but

260
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,920
really the goal of this taxonomy is to

261
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,019
support future work

262
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,420
before you remember where this to tell

263
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,100
you the context here that where this

264
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,260
came from is that the workshop report

265
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,660
does have this a single paragraph that

266
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,459
talks about the fact that there are

267
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,160
different kinds of centralization and in

268
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,560
Philadelphia if for those people who

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,540
were at the Philadelphia research group

270
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,820
meeting uh dinarg

271
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,920
um there was a really robust discussion

272
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,959
and what was interesting was there were

273
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,180
long mic lines and people talking about

274
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,000
many different things

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,459
so the workshop report has this text in

276
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,839
it and I'm not going to read this text

277
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,360
to you instead I'm going to basically

278
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,700
tell you that when looking at talk to

279
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,040
you about organizing the content of this

280
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,620
session many of the features of the

281
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,200
workshop report are were built into her

282
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
presentation that you just saw five

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,160
minutes ago for instance the first one

284
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,740
is about the power of the economies of

285
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,860
scale right and service customization

286
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,380
which we'll talk about in a second uh

287
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,680
and and then the um the overall effect

288
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,779
of Monopoly players in the market right

289
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,120
so this is this is text that's lifted

290
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,459
from the workshop report and it's part

291
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,800
of the it's part of the motivation for

292
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,260
this taxonomy document

293
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,139
now there is um just this first version

294
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,200
of the taxonomy and it divides the topic

295
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
into four areas

296
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,860
and this is where I'm going to spend my

297
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,019
time here uh the rest of my time on the

298
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,100
agenda

299
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,139
so there is the concept of economic

300
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,079
consolidation right and centralization

301
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,060
we hear a lot about that because it's

302
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,339
Market forces that make this happen

303
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,079
there's traffic and infrastructure

304
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,940
consolidation if you've ever seen

305
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,699
statistics here like the statistics that

306
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,500
Jeff produces there's a lot of people

307
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,139
who produce uh statistics about traffic

308
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,540
uh changes to traffic models in the

309
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,860
public internet

310
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,399
there's a whole facet here related to

311
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,860
Traffic and infrastructure and it has an

312
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,139
interesting knock-on effect because it

313
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,180
affects architectural consolidation

314
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,579
right we see that the internet is

315
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,920
provided in a different way than it was

316
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
say 15 years ago so not only do we have

317
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
the nuts and bolts the number of bits

318
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,420
where they go how things are routed how

319
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,459
peering takes place but we also have

320
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,100
Architectural Components especially the

321
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,620
rise of intermediaries as an example

322
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,380
then finally we have service and

323
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,660
application consolidation right a

324
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,579
separate area where we see the

325
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,560
application layer having more and more

326
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
of a role especially from dominant

327
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,300
providers of those services and

328
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,360
applications and so the taxonomy breaks

329
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,699
the it breaks up the issue of

330
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,980
centralization into these four topic

331
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,600
areas okay and that's really the the the

332
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,300
fundamental part of this taxonomy

333
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,579
economic consolidation is something that

334
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,199
we've talked about a lot we talked about

335
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,000
it in Philadelphia there are some great

336
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,180
papers in the workshop related to

337
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,040
economic consolidation and the

338
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,079
centralization refers to the effects of

339
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,800
Market Market players right and and the

340
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,199
effects on competition and the economic

341
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,680
power of a very small set of companies

342
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,380
and in the taxonomy document one of the

343
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,420
things we suggest is that there's two

344
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,860
aspects to this

345
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,860
first a small number of companies

346
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,100
dominate the marketplace right and also

347
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,980
that that small number of companies

348
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,720
dominate the flow of capital in the

349
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,899
internet's economic ecosystem right two

350
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,940
separate features but both about

351
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,680
economic consolidation and

352
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,420
centralization

353
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,240
sure

354
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,860
I was wondering so one thing I forgot to

355
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,699
mention for the time Slaughter location

356
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:02,100
that's including discussion and and the

357
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,339
QA part and therefore uh everyone needs

358
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,740
to be careful about okay

359
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,819
okay well we could

360
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,699
I think I think at the end is what I

361
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,959
would say here

362
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,000
um

363
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,179
so separate from economic centralization

364
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,640
is the concept of traffic and

365
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,380
infrastructure consolidation what we're

366
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,900
seeing is that a significant majority of

367
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,820
the internet's public traffic is

368
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,000
delivered from very very large Services

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
okay and and someone in the room in the

370
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,020
in the workshop report there are actual

371
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,299
statistics provided for that so there's

372
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,640
there's actual data that drives that

373
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,280
first bullet and naturally what these

374
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,080
companies are trying to do is they're

375
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
trying to provide the best possible

376
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,039
service for their end customers because

377
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,100
that drives the user base up and that

378
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,440
builds the economy of scale

379
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,539
in today's internet the result is really

380
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,820
a flattening of the traditional topology

381
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,919
of the internet what we've got is a

382
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,260
situation where the end-to-end principle

383
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,000
isn't really the principle that's at

384
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
work here right in fact one of the

385
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,559
things that was in the workshop report

386
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,260
is this uh first sub bullet here a

387
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,700
recent study shows that these large

388
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,919
Services reach more than three quarters

389
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,220
of the internet without having to do any

390
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,400
Transit of traditional isps traditional

391
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,140
large-scale isps

392
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,660
and another report that was done in

393
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,580
February right around the time or just

394
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,039
before the Philadelphia meeting

395
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,559
was that the number of web pages hosted

396
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,160
on large dominant uh companies has

397
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,740
increased at a rate exceeding 80 percent

398
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,100
on a year-by-year basis that's enormous

399
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,780
centralization that's enormous

400
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,940
consolidation

401
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,600
now the third the third of the four

402
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,720
categories in the uh taxonomy is

403
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,480
architectural consolidation and in my

404
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,080
paper what I the draft suggests that

405
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,840
there are really two pieces to this one

406
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,700
is the emergence of intermediary

407
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,400
Services right services that are sitting

408
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
either in the core of the network or

409
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,539
provide services that look as if they're

410
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,880
not being provided at the edges of the

411
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,860
network and then the movement of

412
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,240
Transport related code to the

413
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
application layer all right well one of

414
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,620
the things that we have are things like

415
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,620
uh dnfs over HTTP right the things like

416
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,880
that where we're pushing up to the

417
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,799
application layer things that used to be

418
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,360
provided by different layers in the

419
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,580
network let me talk about both of these

420
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,220
in turn

421
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,840
intermediaries Technologies like cdns

422
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,640
are actually built into the network for

423
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,740
very good reasons right efficient

424
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,340
delivery of services and content uh

425
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,039
lower latency for end users the ability

426
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,140
to one of the things that's important

427
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,600
about intermediaries is the ability to

428
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,700
distribute the content very uh very

429
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,940
efficiently and the end user is almost

430
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,919
always unaware that the service or

431
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,600
application that they're trying to take

432
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,160
advantage of

433
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,840
isn't what they're getting the service

434
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,220
from right

435
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,440
the key to this is moving the content

436
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,419
and the services close to the end user

437
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,380
as possible

438
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,679
and what happens there is that once

439
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,860
again the power of having a small number

440
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,840
of providers and the economy is a scale

441
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,880
that go with that mean that there are a

442
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
set of concerns related to its

443
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,980
consolidation and centralization

444
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,260
associated with those intermediaries

445
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,480
the second of the two is the actual

446
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
movement of

447
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,799
um uh movement of

448
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,520
services from say the transport layer up

449
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,799
to the application layer the application

450
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,400
layer now providing those Services

451
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,520
specific for the application I'll talk

452
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,559
more about this in a second but these

453
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,080
are things that are very familiar to all

454
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,120
of us in the room I'm sure the fourth

455
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,799
bullet is the one that's important to me

456
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,559
is that now what happens is applications

457
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,020
effectively are in a position to provide

458
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,299
their entire ecosystem almost a closed

459
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,520
system where they actually provide

460
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,799
everything from the transport layer up

461
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,200
the rest of the stack

462
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,419
the fourth and the final

463
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,360
um part of the taxonomy is service and

464
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,880
application consolidation this is the

465
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,980
fourth sort of this is my suggestion of

466
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,220
a fourth layer for the taxonomy it's the

467
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,080
services and applications that the users

468
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,919
see

469
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,600
when they're actually interacting with

470
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,179
the internet and one of the things that

471
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,100
was in an isoc report that I think was

472
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,559
from last year is this quote and I think

473
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,380
it's um a very germane quote for this

474
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,600
part of the taxonomy is that what we

475
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,100
have here is a very small number of

476
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,140
companies operating some of the

477
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,659
internet's most popular services and

478
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,100
many of those companies act as

479
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,960
multi-sided markets so they're actually

480
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,520
working not just

481
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,980
with the the people who are transporting

482
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,960
bits across the network but they're also

483
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,940
delivering Services directly to the end

484
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,520
user and so they that means that those

485
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
Services act as a base upon which other

486
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,679
companies can build services on top of

487
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,559
and all that does is increase the power

488
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,039
of that dominant dominant organization

489
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,419
that's very different from an

490
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,340
architectural consider consideration

491
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,100
this uh pushing uh pushing the

492
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,620
consolidation and centralization up to

493
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,840
the application layer is a very very

494
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
important part of what we saw come out

495
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,120
of the workshop and also the discussions

496
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,100
we had in this research group in

497
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,960
Philadelphia

498
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,240
before I ask for questions

499
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,659
let me finish up so the four the four

500
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,960
areas I had to have one graphic the four

501
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,039
areas

502
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,320
um in terms of consolidation and

503
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,940
centralization that I'm talking about

504
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,840
here are economic centralization traffic

505
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,260
and infrastructure centralization

506
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,120
architectural centralization and service

507
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,360
and application layer centralization

508
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
my goal with this taxonomy document is

509
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,940
to get us to think about individual

510
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,820
parts of this and talk about how for

511
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,840
instance

512
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,620
the the irtf can give guidance to the

513
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,679
ietf about protocol design that

514
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,740
addresses a particular issue now maybe

515
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,679
that's not possible but here was my

516
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,020
suggestion a year ago is that what the

517
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,900
irtf could do is actually provide

518
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,080
guidance to the ietf about just as we

519
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,179
provide

520
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,919
security considerations or Iana

521
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,400
considerations in an RFC we might talk

522
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,980
about centralization considerations

523
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,520
right and the irtf could possibly give

524
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,080
guidance in that area

525
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,620
just like RFC 3552 gives guidance

526
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,860
regarding security considerations so too

527
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,360
you could imagine an informational

528
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,059
document coming out of the irtf that

529
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,419
gave consolidation considerations

530
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,140
that that was what was behind my

531
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,340
interest in creating a taxonomy

532
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,840
so

533
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,480
setting up for questions here what this

534
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,820
is supposed to do is just guide future

535
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,760
discussion of consolidation uh what I'm

536
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,640
it's currently a zero draft document so

537
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,440
I'm obviously looking for comments

538
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,960
suggestions one of the comments that's

539
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,700
perfectly appropriate here is that this

540
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,380
isn't going to work I would listen to

541
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,039
that although I might push back

542
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,080
um whether or not these four categories

543
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,179
are accurate is it a correct description

544
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,820
of the kinds of inputs that we got for

545
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,220
the workshop and the kinds of inputs we

546
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,980
got for from people at the microphone uh

547
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,260
in Philadelphia have I accurately

548
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,200
reflected that into these four groups

549
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,360
and then finally it's my intention as

550
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,020
soon as I can after the London ietf to

551
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,419
turn around a revised version of the

552
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,580
document and post that to the mailing

553
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,039
list for further comments

554
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,520
and let me stop

555
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,780
let me stop and see if there are

556
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,860
questions or comments

557
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,020
no Dirk can you see who's on the line

558
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,240
yes so Andrew from the link is in the

559
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,860
queue

560
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,360
yes hi

561
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,620
um well firstly

562
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,240
for what it's worth I think that's a

563
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,580
good reflection of the discussion As I

564
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,179
understood it uh in in Philadelphia

565
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,059
um and then just made one comment uh on

566
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,880
the document uh you might want to just

567
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,340
put perhaps in the economic uh piece

568
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,380
something about the Sprint net because

569
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,900
in my opinion this is if you're like a

570
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,760
different aspect of the Splinter net

571
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,559
oh sorry um as it says on the screen uh

572
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,020
Andrew camping

573
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,299
uh sorry that's the point of the uh Mike

574
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:01,020
Q uh anyway uh as I was saying there's a

575
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,480
whole Splinter net uh aspect here and I

576
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,980
think this is another aspect of the

577
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,360
Sprinter net not the one that people

578
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,820
traditionally talk about but arguably

579
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,400
this is far more important to users than

580
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,320
the sort of the political uh Splinter

581
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,880
net because this is actually real now

582
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,620
rather than something which is perhaps a

583
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,980
threat for the future okay thanks

584
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,179
Jim

585
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,820
name and affiliation Jim needs no

586
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,700
affiliation I work for myself

587
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,760
and I don't know what I'm doing here uh

588
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
Mark I think you've done a very great

589
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,020
job of summarizing the discussions and

590
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,580
how we've got to where we are here just

591
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,279
now so kudos for that and I think the

592
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,440
initial content of the draft is a

593
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,539
reasonable reflection of where we are at

594
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,340
the moment it mainly thought about

595
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,140
tweaking further on but I do think this

596
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,940
is an important topic and it's something

597
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,400
that this research group could explode

598
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
further as you see I think there's a

599
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,360
potential chance later on about how that

600
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,880
research work can then feed into the

601
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,799
rest of the ietf that'll be an

602
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,179
interesting discussion to have maybe

603
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,919
further down the line but I think it's

604
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,900
very important that we start talking

605
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,880
about this and it seems to be at the

606
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,039
moment this is the only Forum we've got

607
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,440
in the ITF to do that so I would hope

608
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,120
everybody else in this group live in the

609
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,340
room were abroad in let's follow this

610
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,320
online will support the work and

611
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,940
encourage Taking It Forward because it

612
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,380
has to be done and if it's not going to

613
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,580
be done here it's not going to be done

614
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,860
at all and that's a big problem

615
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,159
all right thanks Jim Dirk you're next

616
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,620
yes um yeah thanks Mark for putting this

617
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,580
together

618
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,360
um

619
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,520
um I just wanted to challenge a little

620
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,799
bit this notion of um this

621
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,380
centralization considerations that that

622
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,200
you um mentioned

623
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,679
um so in my experience

624
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,440
um quite often um it's really not easy

625
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,740
to tell the effect of certain protocols

626
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,020
or political features um with respect to

627
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,179
centralization so I was wondering

628
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,919
whether you had some further thoughts on

629
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,720
this already

630
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,039
thank you

631
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,039
I think well I do and they're they're

632
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,380
just my thoughts Dirk and they're not

633
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,360
sanitized for the office

634
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,960
um

635
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,720
the first example that I'll give you is

636
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,360
an example like privacy pass which is

637
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,000
under development right now which is an

638
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,740
example of a a protocol that by design

639
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,020
has a very small number of

640
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,100
um it's it's a token-based system to

641
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,020
provide privacy for end users and yet

642
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,740
allow for authentication at servers Etc

643
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,799
um but by Design the architecture limits

644
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,179
another number of token granting

645
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:41,580
servers and so the protocol by Design

646
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,440
does that and I I for my myself I look

647
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,039
at the um uh the services that we are

648
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,200
developing in the ietf that have

649
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,539
intermediary components like the

650
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,120
oblivious HTTP as an example right where

651
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,220
you have something in the middle between

652
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,320
the requester and the provider of

653
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,380
services and I think in those cases what

654
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,640
I worry about is the the quantity or the

655
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,039
consolidation of those services in the

656
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,840
middle that's that's a concern of mine

657
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,480
so that would be the example I would I

658
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,159
would pitch to you

659
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,340
okay great thanks I could imagine

660
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,559
um this characterization could be quite

661
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,659
controversial at times

662
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,580
um but yeah let's

663
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,100
um think about this for now thank you

664
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,480
I would be I'd be very happy to hear

665
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,919
antagonistic comments in addition so

666
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,320
that would be just fine our note your

667
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,860
next yeah thank you Mark so Arnold from

668
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,820
broadcom

669
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,860
so thank you for putting this work

670
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,240
together

671
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,279
um in fact so it's a support to this

672
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,919
work it's just have you considered other

673
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
aspects of consolidation like uh overall

674
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,279
resilience so what happens when we have

675
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,020
a major problem with one of these

676
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,679
Consolidated uh actor

677
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,440
we have a number of examples uh in the

678
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,320
past that that seems to be

679
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,419
minimized but uh they are not in terms

680
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,820
of when it fails what happens

681
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,120
another one is trust so

682
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,659
what is it the trustworthiness that we

683
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,140
have in these Consolidated actors

684
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,020
and another one which is perhaps more

685
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,140
difficult to approach

686
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,919
is probably the current gravitation of

687
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,980
regenerization in the world that is

688
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,559
that he's going against a consolidation

689
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,899
regardless if they want it or not

690
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,820
so there are three aspects here that

691
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,559
might be considered by the draft but in

692
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,840
general we support distract

693
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,299
okay thanks for that and I'll cut the

694
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,379
cue after Colin here

695
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,059
hi uh Colin Perkins University of

696
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,140
Glasgow

697
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,860
um

698
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,200
so I think this is really nice work uh I

699
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,539
think it's really good um to try and uh

700
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,700
be a little bit systematic on the the

701
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,559
things driving consolidation and

702
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,840
centralization

703
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,580
um

704
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,340
were there any things that were

705
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,399
identified as explicitly not driving

706
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
centralization and should the draft be

707
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,320
thinking about that or is that a

708
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,440
different piece of work

709
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,179
well that's a great question and uh

710
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,799
you'll not be surprised to hear that I

711
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,779
don't have a good answer for that

712
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,520
um I think the draft should consider

713
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,260
that but that feels like a separate

714
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,760
piece of work

715
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,640
um what you'd eventually like out of

716
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,279
this piece of work the taxonomy is sort

717
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,020
of a narrowing of scope for certain

718
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,200
kinds of research uh that that so that

719
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,659
the research group is productive in the

720
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,760
future by focusing on for instance

721
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,679
architectural principles as an example

722
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,620
right or focusing perhaps on the

723
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,480
application the changes that the

724
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,220
application layer

725
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,720
um but what you suggest is something

726
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,880
that the draft probably should think at

727
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,159
least think about and

728
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,380
um if the authors of the draft think

729
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,059
that it's appropriate to do a separate

730
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,320
document

731
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,080
we'll talk to them about yeah it may not

732
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,720
be the same document right yeah okay

733
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,539
thank you okay many thanks to everyone

734
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,760
um I will inserted myself at the last uh

735
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,120
because I cannot get into my laptop uh I

736
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,000
would like to Second columns the comment

737
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,460
this is really a great contribution I

738
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,679
think it's so much material that's all

739
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,980
part of the discussion on this topic

740
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,360
uh two specific comments uh one is that

741
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,539
you mentioned about the architectural

742
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,360
centralization and use the CDN as an

743
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,419
example my question is is the CDN

744
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,820
Architectural Components or is it

745
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,919
actually independent from the protocol

746
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,100
stack of the architecture but just you

747
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,299
know overlay

748
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:57,960
to I would say achieve the functions

749
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,039
that the protocol stack didn't provide

750
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,340
that's a scalable content dissemination

751
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,740
and today is that DDOS mitigation which

752
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,919
I think are both are the deficit of the

753
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,320
VIP architecture

754
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,440
yeah the second question I just like to

755
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,779
bring up for discussion

756
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:25,679
uh like you mentioned in yours uh

757
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,880
draft

758
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,539
that you can't have a skill it's a

759
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,940
fundamental factor that that has to

760
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,500
where we are today

761
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,140
now the question is whether we can just

762
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,140
divide the Technical Solutions alone

763
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,720
to actually mitigating this fundamental

764
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,919
economical

765
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,120
problem

766
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,580
that's just the you know bring up the

767
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,919
question for people to think about thank

768
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,200
you very much well let me let me respond

769
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,820
to your first question the second

770
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,320
question about economics is something

771
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,360
where I feel like I'm on Shaky Ground

772
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,640
And so I would be I would be thrilled if

773
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,620
people uh provided comments on the

774
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,260
mailing list uh about the economics part

775
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,399
in terms of the architectural

776
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,500
considerations uh

777
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,460
see

778
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,560
cdns is an example of an architectural

779
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,260
change to the internet and the way the

780
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,060
way I think about it is the historic

781
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,760
view of the end-to-end principle is

782
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,619
really no longer in play we're asking

783
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,560
we're asking the core and the edges of

784
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,540
the network to do much more than they

785
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,580
they used to do I think that's an

786
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,679
architectural change

787
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,418
um and I think we don't

788
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,500
um

789
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,659
I don't I think that there are many

790
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,480
times where we don't uh acknowledge that

791
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,780
and and I see there's disagreement

792
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,639
and I can't wait to talk to you about it

793
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,639
so that's that's great I I'm I'm happy

794
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,739
I'm happy to hear input and I look

795
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,239
forward to it this week if you want to

796
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,339
be around I would just say that to keep

797
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,500
the schedule I was still back how much

798
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,300
and to send to the mailing list but I

799
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,339
think that's a great question to bring

800
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,800
up that is what is the entrance

801
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,940
principle

802
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,240
and as the the world changes

803
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,420
that's the definition also change all

804
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,220
right there used to be end-to-end is

805
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,440
end-to-end reliability and that's no

806
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,880
longer there

807
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,619
you know even with mobile there's no

808
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,720
end-to-end connectivity

809
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,040
but uh

810
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,859
yeah I'll give that to the well we've

811
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,859
taken we've taken her 20 minutes uh but

812
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,260
I look forward to having conversations

813
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,260
with you in the hall and also um online

814
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,079
uh on the mailing list so Dominique you

815
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,320
up

816
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,320
thanks

817
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,160
so thank you Mark

818
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,680
um and Mark's long before Mark's

819
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,099
excellent work uh we co-authored

820
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:56,160
um this particular uh draft which

821
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,960
actually addresses the end-to-end

822
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,660
principle addresses what um a little bit

823
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,079
to a short extent also addresses some of

824
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,359
the um threat analysis I think our no

825
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,460
brought it up uh so hopefully I'll

826
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,500
address answer your question or no a

827
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,540
little bit as well so can I have the

828
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,720
next slide thank you right so here we

829
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,839
are in version five so we started this

830
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,079
um this originally in November 2020 and

831
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,460
um in the last version in the current

832
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,640
version one thing that we did is um or

833
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,440
in particular I did is actually really

834
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,859
narrow it down because of your taxonomy

835
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,440
um and I've referenced a little bit more

836
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,260
of um Mark's excellent work in terms of

837
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,040
really getting a broader view uh so so

838
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,500
basically this particular uh this

839
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,660
particular draft is is kind of looking

840
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,119
at the current state at a higher level

841
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,880
than than Mark goes into but um but the

842
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,980
other thing it does is talk about maybe

843
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,180
potential outcomes or options or ideas

844
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,460
for uh going forward it also talks about

845
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,320
a little bit some of the risks so I'll

846
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
get into that a little bit in depth but

847
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,820
I'm not going to take too much time

848
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,680
thanks

849
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,140
so um yeah so as Mark said in his

850
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,540
taxonomy uh draft you know there's a

851
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,820
wide variety of different views uh

852
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,560
there's even different definitions right

853
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
some people are using the word

854
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,280
consolidation some are using

855
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,380
centralization I'm finding we're

856
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,300
interchanging it a lot

857
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,280
um but we really need to kind of think

858
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,500
about linguistically what we're what

859
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,119
we're looking at and and there's a

860
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,980
there's a couple of definitions in there

861
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,480
as well

862
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,520
um I have a bit more background in

863
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,859
economics so we look a little bit more

864
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,920
of the positive I would say aspects of

865
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,260
consolidation the economies of scale the

866
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,000
ability to build

867
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,220
um data centers and have Investments at

868
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,400
a very big and Grand scale

869
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
um but then conversely

870
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,440
um a lack of Market competition uh in

871
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,540
some areas in some places depending on

872
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,520
the layer and the platform and whatever

873
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,140
else

874
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,060
um and and we originally Mark and I

875
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,040
originally looked at that based on a

876
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,920
report that was done in the US was is

877
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,660
done in Congress and you know that's

878
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,640
going back to two and a half years now I

879
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,140
think um and that was sort of some of

880
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,020
the interest of the economic background

881
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,480
um in terms of security

882
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,460
uh end-to-end encryption forces data to

883
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,079
the endpoints um there's a little bit

884
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,540
more I'll show in the next slide or next

885
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,240
couple slides on

886
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,420
um on that idea and on that concept and

887
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,820
again picking up probably

888
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,440
um earlier than Mark talking a bit about

889
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,420
consolidation through development

890
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,460
choices architectural choices and

891
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,980
protocol development choices so

892
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,579
next slide right so we talked a bit or

893
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,079
Mark talked a bit about this the

894
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,079
changing architecture the internet

895
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,359
um and I think that choices you know

896
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,359
people make obviously have effects

897
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,760
architectural and Engineering effects

898
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,680
um and in my personal interest I'm also

899
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,480
interested in the wider effects the

900
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,880
economic effects the policy effects the

901
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,800
effects that actually

902
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,560
um make users make different choices so

903
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,680
we talk quite a bit about that in this

904
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,500
um draft and also I think it would be

905
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,839
worth it to have even more discussion

906
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,760
about it but the n-10 principle that

907
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,339
Lexia brought up the reliability and the

908
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,079
trustworthiness

909
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,660
um and and you know it's moving to from

910
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,540
end to end to edge to edge

911
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,859
um and I really like your questions

912
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:30,480
Alexia because I think in the next draft

913
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,420
I'm gonna probably look at that a bit

914
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,280
more right you know do we need to think

915
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,579
about defining this a bit differently

916
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,240
um

917
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,339
briefly talked about Network and devices

918
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,980
as consolidators as well a little bit

919
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,560
with the upcoming 5G Network slicing

920
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,000
things like that

921
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,099
um and and one thing on the edge to edge

922
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,640
is something that uh I think Russ was

923
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,700
talking about through his um get and get

924
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,400
his GitHub post and everything about the

925
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,160
the sort of protocols not being doing

926
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,680
one thing but being the Beyond end-all

927
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,020
of all things so the idea that protocol

928
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,540
development in some cases not all cases

929
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,700
have quite a number of activities and

930
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,160
characteristics that they take on that

931
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,280
that's taken on when they're deployed

932
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,760
um thank you so risks uh hopefully this

933
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,740
is something that is touched upon

934
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,780
briefly by two examples

935
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,400
but again

936
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,880
um decentralized to centralization

937
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,460
decreased stability and fragility

938
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,320
um thinking about in in terms of another

939
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,540
draft that I have uh on the threat

940
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,640
models right and thinking about what's

941
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,380
happening in terms of more recent

942
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,579
attacks

943
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,800
um and how they're being executed not

944
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,900
always successfully

945
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,119
um so the redundancy issue around the

946
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,640
idea of the decentralized internet and

947
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,560
and redundancy when you have fewer

948
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,260
providers and we've seen that obviously

949
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,000
with a number of issues like when

950
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,040
WhatsApp went down last week you know

951
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,780
everybody freaks out

952
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,760
um but yeah that's basically what we're

953
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,380
trying to capture in a more in a more

954
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,940
technical sense

955
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,680
um and also a threat visibility and

956
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,040
diversity so one more I think there's

957
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,740
this is the last slide

958
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,780
um so I really appreciate the the

959
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,180
opportunity to have a place for this now

960
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,940
through that through all of you

961
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,700
um and uh and so just thinking about

962
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,619
some of the options coming up do you

963
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,540
know what do we look further at I like

964
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,720
the idea that Colin mentioned about what

965
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,820
isn't you know consolidation as a work

966
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,960
item

967
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,300
um and uh or as a potential draft but

968
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,220
also focusing on more measurement in

969
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,020
different areas but what else what else

970
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,260
can we continue the discussions on

971
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,839
um and here I have a couple of uh

972
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,579
proposals that were in some earlier

973
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,200
drafts that we did but you know

974
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,000
measurement

975
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
um consideration of consolidation in

976
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,900
rfcs you know should it be its own

977
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,400
section should it potentially be

978
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,460
reviewed by people or as an item that

979
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,260
people review who knows but just

980
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,119
throwing out some ideas and human rights

981
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,920
review as well

982
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,140
um something that that I I think would

983
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,540
be interesting to discover and talk

984
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,579
about so any further thoughts is welcome

985
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:14,760
happy to take it offline and again I'm

986
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,680
it's going a bit more hand in hand with

987
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,119
your work too

988
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,339
so um I think that's it

989
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,980
next slide

990
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,000
yep that's it

991
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,480
so any parents or questions about me

992
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,119
so we have think of a nice summary that

993
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,020
is great

994
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,000
uh I have a question regarding your work

995
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,859
on the end to end there's another draft

996
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,500
in progress with uh Mallory Nuttall and

997
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,140
yet another one with Alec Moffett and

998
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,140
both of those just address a basically a

999
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,660
conceptual flaw in how we have been

1000
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,820
looking at end to end and how that has

1001
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,040
been propagated I like

1002
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,020
sort of the term edge to edge that

1003
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,940
you're working with here but there's

1004
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,339
also catches with adding yet more

1005
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:05,940
vocabulary to a space that has holes in

1006
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,640
it already I'm wondering how you are

1007
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,200
defining that difference or how you're

1008
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,520
working with those other drafts to

1009
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,200
consolidate this that's a really good

1010
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,119
idea so I one of the things and I don't

1011
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,099
know if Mallory is here in the room yay

1012
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,280
so can I catch up with you this week

1013
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,540
because I would love to do that I know

1014
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,220
Alec really well but I haven't read his

1015
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,380
draft yet so I think

1016
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,420
um again the economies of scale would

1017
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,000
make more sense but maybe maybe we need

1018
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,940
to talk more about the definition of it

1019
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,500
um but thank you actually that's a

1020
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,240
really good point that I need to kind of

1021
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,579
think more about that so so to answer

1022
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,380
your question directly we haven't worked

1023
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,300
together but we know each other well so

1024
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,460
I think that's a good place to start so

1025
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,140
thank you for that okay great there's

1026
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,940
also a white paper out about that that's

1027
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,640
we're using both those drafts just to

1028
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,260
know that there's a whole branch of work

1029
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,359
on that I'm a little annoyed with Alec

1030
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:55,980
didn't tell me anyway

1031
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,700
have to live

1032
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,480
hello Roland Bliss uh just a quick

1033
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,119
comment on end to end that is quite

1034
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,400
fuzzy term so there's the end-to-end

1035
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,859
argument system design there is

1036
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,480
end-to-end transparency there's

1037
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,579
end-to-end encryption and what are the

1038
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:16,859
ends actually depends on which layer you

1039
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,720
are talking about is it the network

1040
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
layer is it the transfer layer or the

1041
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,040
application layer and this is all at

1042
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,680
least from my point of view mixed up

1043
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,440
somehow so we need to really Define

1044
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,319
things concisely and precisely

1045
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,599
thank you thank you very much

1046
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,420
and I would just added one more comment

1047
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,540
regarding end to end um people think in

1048
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,480
trend is fishing challenges clearly that

1049
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,160
means there's something in the middle

1050
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,560
that interrupted this end-to-end

1051
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,099
something and therefore what are this

1052
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,460
thing in the middle and why they showed

1053
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,579
up in the middle actually I I called the

1054
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:00,720
the word middlebox that really started I

1055
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,780
think 30 years back almost that we

1056
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,280
started seeing something pop up in the

1057
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,859
middle and that middle thing is a girl

1058
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:10,440
wider and wider yeah yeah so I think

1059
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,720
it's a big question to ask why

1060
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,760
why the internet started without the

1061
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,099
middle boxes and now we depend on meta

1062
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:19,280
boxes

1063
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,419
just the eye to the discussion

1064
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,520
thanks thank you

1065
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,020
so we have the third presentation now

1066
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,940
we're actually roughly back to schedule

1067
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,700
okay well back to schedule yes hello

1068
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,380
thank you uh yeah you can skip this

1069
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,720
slide it's about web centralization my

1070
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,940
name is jensenkoser um joke inviting

1071
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,960
here

1072
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,000
um he said that the talk I gave at first

1073
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,980
earlier this year was something I should

1074
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,359
repeat here so that's what I'm doing but

1075
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:50,579
much shorter

1076
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:54,300
um I have a small tiny tiny non-profit

1077
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,560
that tries to do a bit of r d and

1078
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,319
internet technology and this talks more

1079
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,760
about how we

1080
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,940
got into the internet Society Foundation

1081
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,859
grants to work on Solutions potentially

1082
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,859
potential Solutions thank you

1083
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:08,579
um

1084
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,220
so when I say web centralization the way

1085
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,380
I talk about this I usually divide the

1086
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,180
room

1087
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,400
and what I want to say is I want to

1088
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,540
start off with a bit of context here

1089
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,680
first

1090
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,380
um and I'm not sure whether this picture

1091
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,700
that I've picked there is actually

1092
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,500
accurate for for my illustration here

1093
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,140
but I want to show you uh basically an

1094
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,579
easy path and a difficult path to the

1095
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,640
same goal right and with the web I get

1096
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,020
the impression that the easy path leads

1097
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,700
somewhere we don't want to be

1098
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,460
thank you next slide

1099
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,380
sorry

1100
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,480
um this is about decentralized Network

1101
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,579
infrastructure I tend to talk about

1102
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,440
distributed a lot more I'm sure all of

1103
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,480
you have seen this diagram

1104
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,900
um I just wanted to to

1105
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,240
basically bring it up because if I talk

1106
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,380
about distribution that's what I'm

1107
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,900
talking about the the this one here no

1108
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,020
the rightmost type of architecture

1109
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,960
um

1110
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,020
my my view here is and this is why I

1111
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,420
wanted to bring this up is that this

1112
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,619
kind of this video network doesn't

1113
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,119
really work well with the client server

1114
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,520
Paradigm and I'm going to go into this

1115
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,440
very briefly later on thank you

1116
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,460
I don't have to tell you what the web is

1117
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,560
but rest is but it's kind of important

1118
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,660
to point out once in a while that rest

1119
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,140
and restful is not the same thing

1120
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,280
we can have long discussion about this

1121
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,900
outside

1122
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,180
um but there is something about restful

1123
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,540
that tries to map HTTP methods to prod

1124
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,200
style operations and that is actually an

1125
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,240
important part in What I want to talk

1126
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,140
about

1127
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,020
here thank you

1128
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,300
um this is the diagram from the from the

1129
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,940
rest the dissertation all what you have

1130
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,920
to understand here is basically that uh

1131
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,079
from the user agent that's on the left

1132
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,359
hand side all the three paths lead with

1133
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,880
through the same interface and we don't

1134
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,680
need to know uh at all what's going to

1135
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,060
happen on the right hand side how the

1136
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,460
service is provided this is

1137
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,160
essentially the core of rest

1138
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,780
that we have an abstract interface for

1139
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,280
all of this

1140
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,680
thank you yeah this is just the same

1141
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,940
thing in text for people who read the

1142
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,599
slides thank you

1143
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:19,800
um so web centralization

1144
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,099
um I'm I'm a bit concerned that

1145
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,980
um because HTTP pre-assigns the client

1146
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,400
server roads uh that means it's

1147
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,740
impossible for each node that's in in an

1148
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,440
HTTP environment

1149
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,359
to Route Around failures because they're

1150
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,040
already either waiting for something to

1151
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,319
happen if they're a server or they're

1152
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,339
trying to reach something that doesn't

1153
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:42,599
happen

1154
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:45,240
um if there are clients so the whole

1155
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,980
idea of resiliency there doesn't really

1156
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,359
work well with the client server model

1157
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,960
and I think this this contributes to to

1158
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,819
why the web pushes towards

1159
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:55,859
centralization

1160
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:57,480
um the other aspect there that I see is

1161
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,940
that um authentication is centralized on

1162
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,839
the web

1163
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,240
centralized not in the sense that the

1164
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,280
entire internet is you know

1165
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,460
authenticated in the same place but

1166
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,740
um in a service at least

1167
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,440
and that means that the endpoint decides

1168
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,579
also how data is is may or may not be

1169
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,680
accessed

1170
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,339
um

1171
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,220
and I already mentioned that uh

1172
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,680
this this restful approach that maps

1173
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,740
maps crowd style operations to HT

1174
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,980
methods is technically not how rest was

1175
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,500
meant but it has a point

1176
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,260
thank you and that is that we have

1177
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,640
actually and this is where kind of the

1178
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,740
core of what I want to point out

1179
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,740
um we have a natural mapping of these

1180
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,180
methods I think this is why this has

1181
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,920
become so popular we have a natural

1182
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,400
mapping of these these operations to

1183
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,520
some to most of the HTTP methods except

1184
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,160
for updates and one of the things

1185
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,260
um that that

1186
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,180
I realized when I read the rest

1187
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,940
destination again is that actually it

1188
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,460
says there that the the whole point of

1189
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,680
code transfer is optional now called

1190
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,359
transfer is optional

1191
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,079
um

1192
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,660
back then we were talking about Java or

1193
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,339
JavaScript but nowadays it's JavaScript

1194
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:17,520
but if you have a client that that is

1195
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,020
supposed to be generic which is what

1196
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,540
HTTP is all about and you can read any

1197
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,220
resource it can it can delete any

1198
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,800
resource can create any resource if it

1199
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,780
can't update it without getting

1200
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,240
instructions from the server how to do

1201
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,200
so

1202
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,660
then that's those instructions does that

1203
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,380
code and the data become an entangled

1204
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,740
method that you can't take apart anymore

1205
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,839
and this is what puts control over the

1206
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,839
data with the server

1207
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,500
thank you

1208
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,280
and then

1209
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,720
I can only

1210
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,460
briefly repeat what what people have

1211
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,680
been saying before basically

1212
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,660
um there are economic incentives for for

1213
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,760
continuing with this right I don't

1214
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,520
really need to read to this but uh

1215
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,780
except that that you know the natural

1216
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,579
fit of all Gathering all this data is

1217
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:07,440
surveillance Capital capitalism which

1218
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,300
which is a problem nowadays so maybe we

1219
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,780
have to work against this somehow

1220
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,359
so again I'm coming back to this picture

1221
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:16,859
because centralization isn't really

1222
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:18,180
required by the web right nothing

1223
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,619
nothing in the web requires some

1224
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:23,280
fertilizations but um I feel like on a

1225
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,500
technological level uh the incentives

1226
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,079
already stacked towards centralization

1227
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,000
so the question for me and for us uh

1228
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,920
this is I think I understand why Dirk

1229
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,140
and writes me to this group is how can

1230
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,119
we maybe make decisions that push into

1231
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:37,559
the opposite direction

1232
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,839
thank you

1233
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,119
um so from my point of view and I'd love

1234
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,680
to hear a lot about this from you guys

1235
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,500
you know more about this than me is that

1236
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,420
we already have solved some of the the

1237
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,000
authentication authorization

1238
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,200
authentication is solved in quotes

1239
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,480
because you know there's tons to do it's

1240
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,640
just the prince of the sound they have

1241
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,440
something like public cryptography we

1242
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,079
can authenticate people without needing

1243
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,119
a third party in the middle

1244
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,640
authorization is harder

1245
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,319
um I'm working on something basing

1246
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:09,059
capabilities there's going to be a talk

1247
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,920
about power of attorney which I don't

1248
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,900
know but I read

1249
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,000
as being something similar I'm very

1250
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,800
interested in the talk

1251
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,700
um so I think there are ways we can move

1252
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,319
forward with approaches that don't

1253
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,599
require any Central components in a web

1254
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,220
architecture web-based architecture or

1255
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,760
in any web-like architecture for these

1256
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,180
parts of authentication authorization

1257
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,400
next slide thank you

1258
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,020
and then the other part is the how the

1259
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,059
how to disentangle this this mess of

1260
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,740
data and operations being controlled

1261
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,380
entirely by service

1262
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,540
and um well from my point of view we

1263
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,980
have to make the data presentation

1264
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,980
that's the core party of rest know that

1265
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,839
the data is representational and and

1266
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,940
that is what drives

1267
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,020
um the fact that

1268
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,660
the service can control how to modify it

1269
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,160
we have to make this an end-to-end

1270
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,480
problem or client to client problem

1271
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,400
right it's it's it it should not be a

1272
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,339
client to serve a problem at all and if

1273
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:09,180
we just default to just default to

1274
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,280
end-to-end encryption and then that that

1275
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,319
takes the service out of the process we

1276
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,200
have data artists instead of services

1277
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,119
which has other side effects we have to

1278
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:20,280
talk about those at some point

1279
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,500
um and that also means that we don't

1280
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,000
really need all these these crowd start

1281
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,099
operations anymore because basically

1282
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,200
this is also an end to end

1283
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,480
problem at that point and then we don't

1284
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,059
need much of the web anymore

1285
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:34,559
which is not something people like to

1286
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,140
hear and what I see a natural fit for

1287
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,760
this is information Centric networking

1288
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,500
which is another group that doc invites

1289
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,339
me to probably because of this thank you

1290
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:48,500
and that's it thank you any questions

1291
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,660
I was rushing through that

1292
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,640
I'm Rick Moran I'm responding on your

1293
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,280
remark that the web is centralizing uh

1294
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,940
usernames uh as far as I can tell by

1295
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,559
tracing back what seems to have happened

1296
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,760
is that in HTTP the usual add part has

1297
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,859
been used

1298
00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:13,319
as a client identity whereas the rest is

1299
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:16,500
a server identity and what I think we

1300
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,200
should move towards with https to have a

1301
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,599
client URI in a server URI and if you

1302
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,900
use this user in the server side it

1303
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,880
should mean a resource reference so like

1304
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,400
a home page for example and that might

1305
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,859
be the same but it has has become merged

1306
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,480
together it's going to be confused

1307
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,339
together and I've tried to

1308
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:38,220
I try to have this discussion the HTTP

1309
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,319
group but I won't let go of this fusing

1310
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,200
no but I I think this is one of the

1311
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,599
reasons that we ended up pushing all our

1312
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,099
passwords and all our usernames into

1313
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:50,220
every individual web server it's quite

1314
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,000
possible thank you

1315
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,760
hi uh Colin Perkins uh I fear I may be

1316
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,500
jumping the queue

1317
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,000
um apologies

1318
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,440
um

1319
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,140
you see that clients server sort of

1320
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,740
opposes decentralization yeah

1321
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,500
um I don't disagree

1322
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,400
um

1323
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,800
but we seem to have very distributed

1324
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,880
service

1325
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,619
yeah

1326
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,780
and I wonder if there's

1327
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,140
you know so it's it's opposing

1328
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,180
decentralization in one way yet we can

1329
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,220
build massive scale largely distributed

1330
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,020
servers so this is clearly a middle

1331
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,460
ground somewhere there is a helium

1332
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,140
underground yes I mean what that's

1333
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,880
that's why I mentioned this or brought

1334
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,619
up this this diagram of distribution I'm

1335
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,000
talking about the resilience of

1336
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,559
distribution really

1337
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,839
um in in a decentralized system I don't

1338
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,180
see that as that big of a problem

1339
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,220
oh you don't I don't see that as that

1340
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,720
big of a problem in a decentralized

1341
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,059
system and distributed it's it's more of

1342
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,020
a problem

1343
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,180
does it make sense yeah thank you

1344
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:01,020
here yes this is Duke um thanks for

1345
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,680
um

1346
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,579
bringing your work here um so maybe

1347
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,079
um could you

1348
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,319
um maybe explain once more so what is in

1349
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,260
your view the problem of using post for

1350
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,960
updates and what other say negative

1351
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,460
consequences

1352
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,280
um that um are stemming from that and

1353
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,920
what how would a better update protocol

1354
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,240
look like

1355
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,339
sorry I probably rushed through this a

1356
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:27,420
little bit

1357
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,480
um the problem with with with using post

1358
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,599
is not not posed in itself

1359
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,300
um it's that

1360
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,480
the the rest architecture makes a claim

1361
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,440
of of having a generic client and

1362
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,359
the generic line is basically what

1363
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:49,079
enables using uh in this case HTTP as an

1364
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:52,579
abstract interface tool anything right

1365
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,380
and that enables the the scale at which

1366
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,500
the web grows so it's a very very

1367
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,720
um fundamental feature of how how we got

1368
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,300
to where we are today in my opinion

1369
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,020
um

1370
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,700
but

1371
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,099
if you look at how actually

1372
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,440
um any any update request to to web

1373
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,540
services being made

1374
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,319
um

1375
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:15,839
you you don't have the

1376
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,740
standardized HTTP form data anymore

1377
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,900
right my smartphone detailing well it

1378
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,339
doesn't doesn't nobody uses this anymore

1379
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,740
except for very small use cases what

1380
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,260
happens almost exclusively is that the

1381
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,300
server sends some data some some code

1382
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,740
enrollments to the clients which the

1383
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,099
client executes to form a request

1384
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:37,020
that creates the specific representation

1385
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,880
that the server requires

1386
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,900
and that brings control over

1387
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,240
updating and therefore also over the

1388
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,300
data completely to the server side

1389
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,160
does that make more sense

1390
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,800
yeah okay

1391
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,440
thanks I'm going to close the queue here

1392
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,160
um

1393
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,540
and

1394
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,880
um uh I'm gonna take the microphone in

1395
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,859
the room next then I'm going to go to

1396
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,740
Lexia and then I'll go to Wolfgang so

1397
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,098
please

1398
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,160
your point about

1399
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,819
authentication is a good opportunity to

1400
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:21,180
remind everyone that the driving forces

1401
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,460
to centralization are not only economic

1402
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,619
or technical there is also a problem

1403
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:29,099
with the users some users may be most

1404
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:31,800
users don't want to face the internet

1405
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,079
directly they want some sort of

1406
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,660
intermediary between them on the

1407
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,119
Internet on for instance for

1408
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,559
authentication it's a good example

1409
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,200
because managing your own private key is

1410
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,980
odd it's a real problem so autumn

1411
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,880
decentralized authentication through

1412
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,400
public key cryptography can be quite

1413
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,220
dangerous at was experienced by many

1414
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,540
blockchain users for instance so this is

1415
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,059
typically a case where it makes sense

1416
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:03,420
for user to differ to some intermediar

1417
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,299
with maybe not a big centralized

1418
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:09,000
intermediary but at least some level

1419
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,240
level of intermediation I don't even

1420
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,880
disagree with this I I consider this a

1421
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,940
user experience issue right what I find

1422
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,500
interesting in the context of this and

1423
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,020
this is just an observation is that uh

1424
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,940
in in Germany when you want to submit

1425
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,799
your taxes electronically you actually

1426
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,839
have to handle private Keys public keys

1427
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,839
and somehow it hasn't stopped people

1428
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:34,260
from doing so so I think it is workable

1429
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,799
yeah that was probably a backup if you

1430
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:39,960
lose your private key for instance there

1431
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,819
is certainly a solution to get a new one

1432
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:44,880
a like for instance Solutions like

1433
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,400
blockchains for instance yes

1434
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,040
okay so I have Lexia next then Wolfgang

1435
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,420
no no

1436
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,640
the first thing I want to say is that

1437
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,220
I'm so glad to see that we have within

1438
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,680
RG as a platform for all the

1439
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,319
conversations I think to this talk which

1440
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:04,140
every one of them brought up different

1441
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,780
views different perspective

1442
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,339
um

1443
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,020
after this meeting I think we're going

1444
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,700
to have lots of discussions on the on

1445
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,440
the Middle East but for specific

1446
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,240
questions

1447
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,960
this this point that the current server

1448
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,160
somehow

1449
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,980
facilitated is a centralization I just

1450
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,460
want to point out when a wipe first

1451
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,980
occurred in the early 90s we didn't have

1452
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,160
a centralization problem for many years

1453
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,140
I think the centralization became my

1454
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,440
issue only in the last I think less than

1455
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,960
10 years it's ever increasingly become

1456
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,880
an issue so therefore the question

1457
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,540
whether it's really the protocol design

1458
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,599
that's a major factor or it's some other

1459
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,880
major factor that actually has been

1460
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,819
driving the centralization

1461
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:56,339
I I think sorry should I answer this

1462
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:58,920
sure okay thank you I think it's a bit

1463
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,260
like the nature versus nurture debate

1464
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,839
right you have to have both factors in

1465
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,880
order to um several factors in order to

1466
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,880
to come to a certain point and the

1467
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,960
approach could design certain

1468
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,460
contributes

1469
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,079
um I'm not sure and that's my opinion of

1470
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,420
course right I'm not sure whether it's

1471
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,579
the soul cause I think what happens here

1472
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:20,460
is that the protocol design was sort of

1473
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,099
a little bit oblivious to

1474
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,859
how the economies of scale would work

1475
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:28,319
in back when it was done I don't know I

1476
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,540
wasn't part of this right so this is my

1477
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,760
take from nowadays

1478
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,160
and then the economies of scale

1479
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,339
came in and decided to exploit this uh I

1480
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:41,760
think I I hold the proposition that the

1481
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,160
protocol designs

1482
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,540
it's a question where the protocol

1483
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,819
design decides distributed or

1484
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:50,640
centralized take the DNS Services as

1485
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,920
example many years as it was fully

1486
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,720
distributed it's only in the recent

1487
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,799
years

1488
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,720
that became so centralized and the

1489
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,400
protocol hasn't changed

1490
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,400
another example are mail services many

1491
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,540
years the individual organizations ran

1492
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,040
their own mail servers and uh

1493
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,780
SMTP has not changed but the email

1494
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:16,920
Services got banned a large centralized

1495
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,020
so this opens the question whether we

1496
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,440
actually can change the protocol design

1497
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,520
as a way to mitigate centralization

1498
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,040
but more specifically to your question

1499
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,280
with regarding to the client I think a

1500
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,059
client URL into the http that brought up

1501
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:39,780
two questions the first is what is the

1502
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,839
identity for clients do you have a dance

1503
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:45,900
name I don't I'm pretty sure most of

1504
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,599
people are in this room do not oh what

1505
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:51,780
would be the identity for the clients so

1506
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,059
that you can attach a key to it right

1507
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:56,940
key wouldn't work without Identity or

1508
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,160
unless you use the public key alone as

1509
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,740
this identity but that is totally

1510
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,280
I mean how you authenticate

1511
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,920
individual keys without

1512
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,700
meaningful

1513
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,359
identity space I understand yeah yeah in

1514
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:13,740
the last question

1515
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,380
oh comment uh you mentioned that we have

1516
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,900
distributed authentication problem

1517
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,579
solved

1518
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:23,040
solved yes I think authentication

1519
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,740
actually is the easy part again it goes

1520
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,540
back to the harder question

1521
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,400
how you get

1522
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,420
the public key in the authentic way

1523
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,819
that is a trust question

1524
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:39,200
it's a trust question and so how you

1525
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,960
decide the trustworthiness of a key

1526
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,720
today we have the servers authenticated

1527
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,540
because we have the certificate

1528
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,280
authorities

1529
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,839
um

1530
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,319
do you have in mind that everyone get a

1531
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:58,799
certificate from the cas or watching the

1532
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,079
fundamentally different it's across the

1533
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:03,720
management system it's a great question

1534
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,700
um I I don't have an answer to this I

1535
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,980
have a I have a thought about this and

1536
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,240
this goes back to what other people have

1537
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,579
done it's not based on me

1538
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,700
um

1539
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:17,640
I think the

1540
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,579
the number of contexts in which we have

1541
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,160
to have

1542
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,020
authentication

1543
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,700
irregularly proves something about the

1544
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,920
person is actually very very much

1545
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,020
smaller than we tend to assume

1546
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,880
um there is another approach to doing

1547
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,980
this which is usually called a patch

1548
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,760
name system which I quite like is that

1549
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,460
if I receive a public key from any of

1550
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,940
you and you tell me that it's Bob

1551
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:51,180
then to me that is Bob because that's

1552
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,760
what I'm being told and I can base my

1553
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,020
trust level

1554
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,359
on how much I trust

1555
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,180
Bob or the person who sends me this key

1556
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,859
which is very much like the web of trust

1557
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:04,559
except you can do better than the web of

1558
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,119
trust I think

1559
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:08,040
um and I think for very very many

1560
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,319
contexts this is more than sufficient

1561
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,819
it's clearly not going to work for

1562
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:14,000
everything

1563
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,839
okay thank you for being patient

1564
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,720
Wolfgang you're next

1565
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,520
okay we really must distinguish between

1566
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,040
technological centralization and

1567
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,760
economical centralization because Google

1568
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,400
doesn't run one big web server

1569
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,579
um it's has a decentralized architecture

1570
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:34,799
I guess

1571
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,680
if we can solve the economical

1572
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,359
centralization problem I doubt that

1573
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,119
smart point

1574
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,040
yeah I I don't think we can solve the

1575
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,040
economical problem at all we can make it

1576
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,599
maybe a little bit harder to exploit it

1577
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,079
massively

1578
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:59,400
okay or not yeah so thank you in fact

1579
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,020
there was a lot of good points in the

1580
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,299
previous interventions so I would like

1581
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:04,440
to start

1582
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,140
um 30 years ago when I started my career

1583
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,020
I arrived at a place called serum

1584
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,619
and when I open my office in the office

1585
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:15,299
in front of mine with a certain team be

1586
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:16,559
honestly

1587
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,540
I had the chance to witness what

1588
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,579
happened and I promise you that team

1589
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,500
would be in this room he would hate what

1590
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,720
this world has become today

1591
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,420
so from a layer 7 we are now moved to

1592
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,520
layer eight because some parties

1593
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,579
understood oh we can evade regulatory

1594
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:34,380
scrutiny by creating something which is

1595
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:38,039
outside and now we have a layer 9. so

1596
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:41,000
the issue in fact they started to

1597
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,680
recognizes that we are Technologies so

1598
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,380
we like to speak about protocols but in

1599
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,180
the way you present it it's about

1600
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,920
protocol design

1601
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,839
and I think we forget the other term

1602
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,579
which is designed

1603
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:55,440
the problem we face is that when we

1604
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,839
create technology we create technology

1605
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,640
on something where there is zero

1606
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,160
anthropology what we are doing

1607
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,680
that means we create something and well

1608
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,359
let's see what happens let's see how

1609
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:07,799
people adopt it

1610
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:10,079
but it's not like in other areas like

1611
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,420
civil engineering civil engineering

1612
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,119
which actually is rather recent but when

1613
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,099
you trace that down to what a bridge is

1614
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,440
what the experience of a road of a

1615
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,700
building or something it's a thousand

1616
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,160
years ago we have many anthropologies of

1617
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,059
that

1618
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:26,819
so when we do things here is from what

1619
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:27,960
we do

1620
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,520
we don't understand that from the

1621
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,039
technology possibilities might infer

1622
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:34,140
many legislative possibilities that

1623
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,940
might infer many ethics possibilities

1624
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,640
that will end up with anthropologies

1625
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,619
ensures that unfortunately for us some

1626
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:43,079
people were faster to understand that

1627
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:45,240
design piece and understood what is it

1628
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,000
that we have in these three to optimize

1629
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,200
our gain

1630
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,539
and they fixed that and some parties

1631
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:54,299
here wrote about that that it created a

1632
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:57,359
very narrow murder of the human being

1633
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,599
so back to the previous speaker on my in

1634
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:03,059
front here about the user experience I

1635
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:05,220
think when when we design something here

1636
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,079
if we want to really understand what we

1637
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:08,700
are doing let's come back on which

1638
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,099
method are we taking for all of these

1639
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:13,319
three works I've seen so far that could

1640
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:16,020
give a framework about ah now if we

1641
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,479
distillate that against this view what

1642
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,880
does it mean then for the regulation

1643
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,819
Parts the economic part and so on and

1644
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:25,679
the human parts we you could have a

1645
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,560
model to reframe that and and reposition

1646
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,719
your work in a systematic approach

1647
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,880
across your work then as well you can

1648
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,580
ask yourself is this valid is this good

1649
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,979
is this so others can other people other

1650
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:39,540
communities could look at it from an

1651
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,640
Ethics perspective from an anthropologic

1652
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,640
perspective and say actually are we in

1653
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,160
French we call that La fuzz bonide the

1654
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,319
Fool's good idea it looks like a great

1655
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:51,660
idea when it started distributed and so

1656
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,060
on and we don't think about this River

1657
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,060
of unconscious behind us about all of

1658
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,460
these layers because we think as you

1659
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,620
know I am who I am 54 years old made

1660
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,839
white blah blah blah and maybe somebody

1661
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,238
would have a very different idea so my

1662
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,100
message here is I think it's it's a

1663
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,198
great work but perhaps we could help

1664
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:11,698
each other with finding the right

1665
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:13,799
framework on the other side which is not

1666
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:15,660
the protocol piece but the design piece

1667
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:16,799
of course

1668
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,000
thank you

1669
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,460
so Colin and Britta uh I did close the

1670
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,198
queue behind our note but I'm happy to

1671
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:24,660
accommodate you no no I'm happy to

1672
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,399
accommodate you if you can be short I

1673
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,399
will be very short I think uh Colin

1674
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,899
Perkins um

1675
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:33,000
Licious said

1676
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,620
um you know the protocols haven't

1677
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,080
changed and therefore that's a sign that

1678
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,839
we can't predict perhaps uh whether the

1679
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,580
protocols will drive centralization or

1680
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,140
not

1681
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,120
um that may be true it may also be true

1682
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,040
that the requirements have changed but

1683
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,540
the environment has changed and the

1684
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,160
protocol is no longer fit for purpose

1685
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:53,719
foreign

1686
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:58,640
yeah we'll take that discussion online

1687
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,699
so here I'll be very short as well uh

1688
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,620
thank you for this you mentioned before

1689
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,420
about basically the Trust on first use

1690
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,440
model and although that's very usable

1691
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,179
there's also a huge judgment when we

1692
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:13,500
look at this from an adversarial side

1693
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,840
and really when we're talking about the

1694
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,100
space we're trying to talk about

1695
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,620
improvements on both the usability and

1696
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,719
the security or at least maintaining the

1697
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:23,580
security while doing that correct and I

1698
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,260
would just add a caveat as we go down

1699
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,420
this route as we aren't focusing

1700
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,280
strictly on the usability improvements

1701
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,840
that we don't drop all the lessons

1702
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,980
learned that we have on the security

1703
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,780
side

1704
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,719
no you're absolutely right about this um

1705
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,400
the

1706
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,360
um

1707
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,980
no I don't really have a comment on this

1708
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,260
thank you

1709
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,760
I think we need to move on to the next

1710
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,600
presentation now

1711
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:01,140
okay hello we're going to talk about

1712
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,000
power of attorneys here in digital form

1713
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,699
uh here's three Lakshmi she's gone

1714
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:07,980
around most of the presentation I'm a

1715
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,679
love and we are from Lulu University in

1716
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:12,719
Sweden

1717
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,820
so traditionally all of you know about

1718
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,800
poorer attorneys there are legal

1719
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,600
documents that are used to delegate

1720
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,780
privileges to someone we trust people do

1721
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,719
this and there is a secondary party that

1722
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,640
legally acquires some ownership and

1723
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,219
rights as the primary person specified

1724
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,860
and regulated by the POA

1725
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,860
so here we're going to use this idea

1726
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,140
in in a digital standpoint so that can

1727
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,320
be used in situations where news user

1728
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,420
needs to use a trusted device for

1729
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,480
example or a trusted entity

1730
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:50,059
uh to work on her behalf for some time

1731
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,080
so first a little bit about positioning

1732
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,820
and a motivation here

1733
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,860
so we propose this power attorney based

1734
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,780
authorization and and the second bullet

1735
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,880
here is important it's really to

1736
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,179
authorize entities for example say I

1737
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,960
mean autonomous devices or it could be

1738
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,880
non-physical entities too but the

1739
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,440
important thing here is they have an

1740
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,420
identity that's the whole point you

1741
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,880
can't use POA unless you have an

1742
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,980
identity for the other party so we're

1743
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,840
going to look at at fairly powerful

1744
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,840
things here they're called agents and

1745
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,780
they can then act on behalf of the

1746
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:34,380
resource owner for some time and they're

1747
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,600
called the principal here the one that

1748
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,000
is signing so we're using like public

1749
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,600
key uh signatures here so that POA is

1750
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,179
signed by the principal and using the

1751
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:47,159
public key of the agent so that it can

1752
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:49,500
use it later okay

1753
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,840
uh we have some examples that we're

1754
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,699
going to talk about like onboarding for

1755
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:55,920
example in a scalable way where you can

1756
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,320
delegate onboarding privileges to others

1757
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,699
right

1758
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:01,620
the outline of the presentation we just

1759
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:03,179
go ahead and present it now first

1760
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,500
because

1761
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,719
there's so much complementary

1762
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,580
Technologies and state-of-the-art like

1763
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,739
all often other things that would be

1764
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:13,020
caught up with starting with comparison

1765
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,659
so we do that at the end okay so we just

1766
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:18,719
steam ahead next please

1767
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,300
so there are some essential properties

1768
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,000
that makes this different from most of

1769
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,980
what you have seen

1770
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,659
the first one it's first of all

1771
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:29,520
self-contained the POA is completely

1772
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,620
self-contained and decentralized like

1773
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,020
PDP originally

1774
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:37,320
however we can have it supported by an

1775
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,840
optionally signatory registry that can

1776
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,840
store poas and sign them to increase

1777
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,179
credibility

1778
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:49,440
uh there's also separation in time this

1779
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,719
is really important so you can sign a

1780
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,540
POA today and your agent can act upon

1781
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,900
this next day or next week or next month

1782
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,179
the POA will expire at some point in

1783
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:02,820
time it's written into it

1784
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,100
and also the principle may not be online

1785
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,060
or available when the agent

1786
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:10,739
executes on the POA so this is clearly

1787
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:13,260
different from like single sign-on or

1788
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:16,020
when you delegate to like a browser app

1789
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,880
or something one while you're online

1790
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,540
yourself okay so we're in a different

1791
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:24,320
domain here we also enable multi-level

1792
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,780
sub-granting so I can for example give

1793
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,900
you a general POA that you can onboard

1794
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:34,199
devices to my network and then you can

1795
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:36,840
provide poas to your devices and they

1796
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,360
come one by one show the general POA and

1797
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,520
the specific POA that is more restricted

1798
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,540
of course

1799
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:45,239
or you could delegate all your

1800
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:47,699
credentials right

1801
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:50,640
so uh the POA includes detailed

1802
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,199
credentials like expiration time and

1803
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:54,420
contain also could contain additional

1804
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:57,719
Integrity info for example hash of the

1805
01:14:57,719 --> 01:14:59,940
hardware hash of the software if you

1806
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:02,640
want to ensure that POA is valid only if

1807
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,000
this guy hasn't changed

1808
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,440
so that's to begin

1809
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,179
yep uh thank you hello

1810
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:20,580
this is the best idea of what is power

1811
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,980
of attorney based authorization so we

1812
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:25,620
have these three entities the first one

1813
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:28,500
is the principal and this agent and the

1814
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,600
resource server the principal is the one

1815
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,500
who generates the POA and then uh he or

1816
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,199
she can send it to the agent the agent

1817
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,199
is the is the device which can be a

1818
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:42,239
cyber physical system as ulo mentioned

1819
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,520
it can be a semi-autonomous or

1820
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,760
autonomous uh device and we have the

1821
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,699
resource server so the poe which is

1822
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:53,159
generated by the principal uh and

1823
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:56,400
transfer to the agent uh the agent now

1824
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,480
can use the POA uh for to act or to work

1825
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,900
on behalf of the of the principle and

1826
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,760
it's also time limited so after a

1827
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,260
certain time it gets expired uh so um we

1828
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,060
we have we also have the signature

1829
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,980
registry which is uh nothing but a

1830
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:18,000
database that you can use to store uh

1831
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,420
metadata or POA uh which is an optional

1832
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,739
optional thing

1833
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:25,679
so the basic idea is the the agent now

1834
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,900
can work on behalf of the principal

1835
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:31,440
using this POA next slide please

1836
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,280
yep so this is our approach uh to to use

1837
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,820
uh POA for onboarding device on body so

1838
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,400
we actually establish a trust chain

1839
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,580
between the different entities

1840
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,800
um in the onboarding process which is

1841
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,920
which are the subcontractor which is

1842
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,440
nothing but the owner of the device and

1843
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,500
we have the uh the device and then the

1844
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,620
network on the target network onboarding

1845
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,500
controller so we establish a trust

1846
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,960
between these three entities

1847
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,340
so

1848
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,320
um in order to do that how do we do this

1849
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,280
so this is done by the POA so we uh um

1850
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,540
we send a POA between the the

1851
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,520
onboarding controller which is the

1852
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,900
target Network on boarding controller

1853
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,199
and the subcontractor and uh nether one

1854
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:24,140
which is generated by the subcontractor

1855
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,300
uh to the for the device so it's from

1856
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:30,179
the subcontractor to the device so these

1857
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,760
are the two pois that we use for uh the

1858
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,000
this use case on body device on body and

1859
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,219
uh these are the different properties or

1860
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:41,520
uh with with this we can achieve more

1861
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,860
more Administration detail level

1862
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,920
scalability and security and also the

1863
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,080
type time limit limited

1864
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,140
um thing that I explained before and

1865
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,600
also the credentials can also be passed

1866
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:58,260
uh through the POI and law management

1867
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:01,080
overhead and also

1868
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,199
um we have to uh we uh we we the

1869
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:05,880
ownership of the device

1870
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,219
uh it is uh it may or may not be a

1871
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:13,020
transfer from one one person to another

1872
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,000
in this case because the subcontractor

1873
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,640
is the owner of the device

1874
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,159
um in this case so there's a contract

1875
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,040
doesn't really need to transfer it to

1876
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,500
another another entity another person

1877
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,679
so yeah next slide please

1878
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:31,500
Yep this is the protocol flow uh we have

1879
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,440
the subcontractor and this is the

1880
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,920
onboarding component and uh the First

1881
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,920
Step A and B are the two poets I

1882
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,260
mentioned earlier the first one is the

1883
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,560
on on the POA that's generated by the

1884
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,020
onboarding component uh that's sent to

1885
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,000
the subcontractor so that the

1886
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,760
subcontractor right now can now from now

1887
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,280
on can work on behalf of the onboarding

1888
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,840
component which is nothing but on an

1889
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,600
onboard uh then after that the

1890
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,880
subcontractor or the principal now

1891
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,540
generate another POA for the device uh

1892
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,540
so after getting receiving the that POI

1893
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,580
from the subcontractor the device now

1894
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,260
can onboard

1895
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:19,320
so step us a C and C A and B it's um the

1896
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,739
the device is sending these POA along

1897
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:24,659
with some other onboarding credentials

1898
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:27,480
uh to the network onboarding component

1899
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,159
uh so

1900
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:32,880
um it or as usual it verifies everything

1901
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,820
um and or it's sent to a certifying

1902
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,140
Authority

1903
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:40,920
and then there's a CA uh verifies and

1904
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,679
then send back a certificate

1905
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,440
um it is this Um this can change

1906
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,900
according to the use case so in this use

1907
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,199
case yes we have a CA and uh with the

1908
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:53,880
certificate uh along with the

1909
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,900
certificate and other network onboarding

1910
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,780
credentials are sent uh to the

1911
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,480
subcontractor the principle

1912
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,880
um yeah that's that protocol flow maybe

1913
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,860
next slide please

1914
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:10,860
Yep this is how the PO looks like it's

1915
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,040
uh we implemented it as a Json web token

1916
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,280
so the body the body

1917
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,820
um have the public keys of the agent the

1918
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,040
principal and the resource owner which

1919
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,440
is that which can be the target Network

1920
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,040
or onboarding onboarding controller and

1921
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,440
uh we have that a Time expiration the

1922
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,420
important another property is the

1923
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,640
transferable the transferable is nothing

1924
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,000
but the one that ulo mentioned uh we

1925
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,980
support multi-level uh other

1926
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,739
authorization which means from One agent

1927
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:46,320
to another region you can even transfer

1928
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,620
the POA so that they can also do it do

1929
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,120
their own body so that's the

1930
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,100
transferable it's just a parameter in

1931
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,380
it's an integer so it's like 0 1 2

1932
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,380
depends on the value you can uh the

1933
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,500
number of levels it is

1934
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,159
yep so next slide please

1935
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:07,080
yeah so

1936
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,199
um we could implement it as a library

1937
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,960
like an open source Library uh we have

1938
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,560
we have that and also Feature work like

1939
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,040
we have a we can do it as a Docker image

1940
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,600
uh or another interesting implementation

1941
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,560
is uh the integration

1942
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,280
um that is that we have done next slide

1943
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,620
this

1944
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:34,620
so we we this is how we can integrate

1945
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,719
with the oil

1946
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,880
um so as you can see the the principal

1947
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,500
the agent these are the two entities

1948
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,659
that we took from the POA part and

1949
01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:44,880
others are from the oil

1950
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,600
so the principle uh the agent is here a

1951
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,840
device as I mentioned uh earlier it's uh

1952
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,880
it can be a semi-autonomous or

1953
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,719
autonomous device and we send the the

1954
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,620
POI is only one POI in this in this case

1955
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:03,600
uh that sent generated uh by the

1956
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,080
principal and sent to the device

1957
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,500
um yeah so that's how we integrate

1958
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,900
next slide please

1959
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,780
yep that's uh so that's already done

1960
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,820
work

1961
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,400
um the future work is to implement a

1962
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,920
Docker image

1963
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,280
and and also security analysis of the

1964
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,679
um of the proposed work

1965
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:31,640
next slide please

1966
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,659
the last one oh yeah so yeah we have our

1967
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:37,620
draft

1968
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:42,239
the it's available and uh the source

1969
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,520
code for the library that I mentioned

1970
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,280
it's also available in the GitHub

1971
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,620
and the oil po integration part uh we

1972
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:54,540
have submitted a paper but it's not yet

1973
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:59,580
published so uh yep yeah so that's uh a

1974
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,320
code for that is also available in the

1975
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,719
GitHub so if you have any comments and

1976
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:07,260
questions okay thank you for that

1977
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:10,080
presentation I'm going to entertain uh

1978
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,159
people

1979
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:14,159
um I have three people in the queue

1980
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,560
so far and I'm going to start with wixia

1981
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,840
but here's a reminder please introduce

1982
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,420
yourself and your affiliation uh when

1983
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,860
you come to the mic

1984
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,440
in the chair I think I want to declare

1985
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,540
everyone should limit their question to

1986
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,100
be less than two minutes

1987
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,140
have you been the first one two

1988
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,840
questions why is that um

1989
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,960
talk about the the purees

1990
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,000
ETC principles how what are their

1991
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,780
identifiers

1992
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,820
the identifiers at this point you know

1993
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,340
we we it's an early stage so it's the

1994
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,560
public key that they're identified with

1995
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,940
but of course you can have a mapping

1996
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,739
between public key and some other

1997
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:57,199
address so that there is like

1998
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,719
in one of your later slides you have

1999
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,880
multiple entities how they actually

2000
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,500
authenticate each other in the first

2001
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,060
place right the double strapping

2002
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,560
question

2003
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:11,159
right yeah yeah but yeah we assume that

2004
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:14,699
there is a trust between the principle

2005
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:16,800
and the agent so here so so there's a

2006
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,300
question of how that trust gets

2007
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,420
established yeah it's uh we a mutual

2008
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,520
authentication is done by our

2009
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,699
certificates so right of course yeah

2010
01:24:29,179 --> 01:24:31,440
there's a chicken egg problem there yeah

2011
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,360
it is there is a trust chain in the

2012
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,239
beginning for example uh there's often a

2013
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,780
trust in in subcontractors basically so

2014
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:42,239
that's you only give poas to stuff that

2015
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,520
you trust goodness I just remember those

2016
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,739
questions my second question which is

2017
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:47,940
which is how do you see this work

2018
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,800
relates to uh

2019
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,980
the you know the goal of this group how

2020
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,480
this relates to centralization or

2021
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,500
mitigating centralization

2022
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,179
mitigating centralization it's of course

2023
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:03,000
it's we can't guarantee that it will do

2024
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
it but in the in the basic form it is

2025
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,460
decentralized if you have the lib idea

2026
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,040
where you download the source code each

2027
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,340
party can execute the POS individually

2028
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:17,159
without help of anything else at least

2029
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,879
possibly so

2030
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:24,639
[Music]

2031
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:29,400
yes hi uh Jensen Kaiser

2032
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,780
um thank you for this this is pretty

2033
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,980
much exactly what I've been doing as

2034
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,960
well so I think we should talk the only

2035
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,760
question I have is

2036
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,620
um have you considered

2037
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,960
um explicit verification at this point

2038
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,360
because it might issue a POA and then

2039
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,699
decide actually that's not longer no

2040
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:46,199
longer what I want to do

2041
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:48,900
can you repeat access

2042
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,640
sorry maybe that's either that like this

2043
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,560
explicit revocation all right

2044
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,678
yeah

2045
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,960
poets time limited so after certain time

2046
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,500
it get expired and um so it's um it's

2047
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,900
basically the principal who who

2048
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,120
um generates the POI and decide how many

2049
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,320
how long it need to uh need to be uh for

2050
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,260
example how long the task uh how long

2051
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:18,719
the task will take take time how long it

2052
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,000
will be so the principal assume that one

2053
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,060
and then put that now as a number in the

2054
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:27,239
in the poi yeah that's that's also how I

2055
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:29,820
started but um you might issue a POA

2056
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,620
that's valid for a week and in that week

2057
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,179
something happens and you no longer want

2058
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:35,580
to issue it so you can't really take it

2059
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,620
back anymore once it's given out that's

2060
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,060
why I'm saying No this is a very good

2061
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,520
point and it's a central as as long as

2062
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,139
you're decentralized it's the same with

2063
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:45,300
public keys right how do you revoke them

2064
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,400
uh make sure that it doesn't reside

2065
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,400
anywhere like in in the community so

2066
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,440
actually adding some centralization

2067
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,560
there like the the repository could help

2068
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:58,920
in revocation but that's your point okay

2069
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,360
thank you Rowan

2070
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,659
there are Ronald Bliss curity same point

2071
01:27:02,659 --> 01:27:05,940
revocation uh certificates are quite

2072
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:08,699
easy unless you consider revocation that

2073
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:10,860
makes it much more complex and that's

2074
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,320
just you you made my point thanks yeah

2075
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,560
we're aware of this problem and it has

2076
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,840
to be addressed thank you okay thank you

2077
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:21,120
and Dirk you have the last word

2078
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,100
yeah just quickly and thanks a lot for

2079
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:26,340
bringing this work to linaji I just want

2080
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,260
to point out that you got some really

2081
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:31,500
good questions in the in the chat and so

2082
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,060
we won't have time today to answer all

2083
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,699
of those but um we recommend looking at

2084
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:37,320
those and maybe we can follow up on the

2085
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,739
main list

2086
01:27:40,139 --> 01:27:42,540
will we see the questions on the chat

2087
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,780
later

2088
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,040
we we try to save them

2089
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,260
and we'll uh we'll tend to uh capture

2090
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,760
them for the notes for the meeting as

2091
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,480
well

2092
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:58,400
okay thank you both very much thank you

2093
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,760
hello my name is Rick foreign

2094
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,900
um we've been working in a group

2095
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,580
sometimes we call it upper two sometimes

2096
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:20,040
we call the internet y project but we we

2097
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,159
work on decentralization for a few years

2098
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:24,360
um much of what we've done is actually

2099
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,520
already technology and it's it's running

2100
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,679
code so that's a bit concrete for a

2101
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:30,480
research group but there are what we

2102
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,860
found when we talk to different protocol

2103
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:33,780
groups always we need to tell the entire

2104
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,460
story because there's a big story behind

2105
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:36,900
it and that's what we'd like to present

2106
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,460
here

2107
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,739
um the economy is one of the starting

2108
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:43,739
points we also had the economy economy

2109
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:46,860
of skill is uh and and if uh definitely

2110
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,620
there but we do have a strong belief in

2111
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,360
hosting profiles because we do see

2112
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,880
people find it quite normal to pay a few

2113
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,480
Euros a year of pounds whatever

2114
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,340
um to a hosting provider and get some

2115
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,199
basic services for it and they sometimes

2116
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,239
do that together with an email servers

2117
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:06,719
with Gmail for example with Yahoo

2118
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,760
um and all the hosting providers have

2119
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,040
limited resources I mean they generally

2120
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,199
do just a few protocols we believe that

2121
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,480
when they get together they together

2122
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,780
form a very good counter uh voice for

2123
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,120
the few very large silos that that we

2124
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,100
are having now

2125
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,500
um and what we came up with and that's

2126
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,420
just how we see things is hopeful

2127
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,340
discussion is thus

2128
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,260
we we believe it's helpful to take the

2129
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,000
hosting providers and consider two

2130
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,280
different roles for them either in the

2131
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,440
same or in different parties and one of

2132
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,380
them would be an identity provider

2133
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,679
apologies um covering things like dnsack

2134
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,620
Dane and identity provisioning and the

2135
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,260
other would be a service provider and it

2136
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,820
might be a web service provider might be

2137
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:53,340
an email provider or sip or XMP I don't

2138
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,800
care but they would be plugins to each

2139
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,960
other thanks to open protocols this is

2140
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,540
very very well possible and without all

2141
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,580
protocols is pretty much impossible so

2142
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,260
it very much aligns with the way we do

2143
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:06,840
things in the ITF I think next slide

2144
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,920
please

2145
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,500
so um I'll basically already mentioned

2146
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,719
what we believe the thing two things

2147
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,340
should do and how do you get these two

2148
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,199
together well there are some technical

2149
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:18,659
detail like um what host names are going

2150
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:20,639
to be used what IP addresses need to be

2151
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,980
assigned so the way we envision this is

2152
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,560
a Surface provider publishes and I can

2153
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,600
probably an XML file that's pulled into

2154
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,520
the identity provider which it says oh

2155
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,739
hey dear user we just got a new contract

2156
01:30:31,739 --> 01:30:33,960
for you this is the Privacy conditions

2157
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,580
those are the costs that are going to be

2158
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,100
charged and so on and so on do you agree

2159
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,600
with all that and if that's the case

2160
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,520
there's some form of acknowledgment

2161
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,739
going back and from that time on there's

2162
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:45,600
a contract between the identity provider

2163
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,340
and service provider that serves as

2164
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:50,159
plugin into the DNS page it's published

2165
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,320
with Dina sectane TLS all those things

2166
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,699
that are needed

2167
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:57,420
and um the big issue we believe it's

2168
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,060
it's been called solved I don't think uh

2169
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,260
when you get to the details

2170
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:04,139
authentication is completely solved but

2171
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:06,420
we've been looking into how can we trust

2172
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:09,120
an identity from another domain given

2173
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,219
existing protocols because that's what

2174
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:13,199
we get into then

2175
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,560
um you run up to your server it might be

2176
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,719
uh just as a plug-in server and the

2177
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,940
identity provider belonging to to the

2178
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,320
same domain might be running somewhere

2179
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,820
else there needs to be some form of a

2180
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:25,139
trust relationship

2181
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:27,719
both when you address your own server

2182
01:31:27,719 --> 01:31:30,420
like your own IMAP server for example or

2183
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,400
when somebody else runs up maybe to your

2184
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,620
SMTP service says I want to authenticate

2185
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:37,500
before I deposit it before I can launch

2186
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,239
an email towards you

2187
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:40,620
so

2188
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,900
um Trust basically becomes the the

2189
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,400
Central Point

2190
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,260
um we usually take a new new term so

2191
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,699
that we don't get into conflict with

2192
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:50,219
existing terms so we coined term realm

2193
01:31:50,219 --> 01:31:51,060
crossover

2194
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:53,460
and we've identified three technologies

2195
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:56,699
that cover many many if not all not all

2196
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:58,739
but most protocols and especially the

2197
01:31:58,739 --> 01:32:00,480
modern ones

2198
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,760
Cecil is the Paramount one it's just

2199
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,500
about anywhere

2200
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,540
just name a protocol and probably does

2201
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:07,920
it

2202
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,560
um and Kerberos has its own protocols

2203
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,420
every now and that's a bit older usually

2204
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,520
nowadays it's it's in comparison to

2205
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,040
social but some protocols do require

2206
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,639
Kerberos and um we found realm Christoff

2207
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,400
Technologies for both and certificates

2208
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,500
of course are a common common uh

2209
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,540
facility that's being used so I'd like

2210
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,100
to get into these three and how we

2211
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,199
envision that these can be can be used

2212
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,719
without making many changes at all so

2213
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:36,860
next slide please

2214
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,360
oh yeah it's also it's there already

2215
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,420
so um for Sasso which is pretty much

2216
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,580
everywhere already uh social has

2217
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:47,219
mechanisms that you can just very easily

2218
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:50,040
create new uh new mechanisms for so we

2219
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,040
we designed one that's called sxo plus

2220
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,659
and what that does basically it's an

2221
01:32:54,659 --> 01:32:57,900
end-to-end wrapper for uh for that

2222
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:00,540
encrypting end-to-end wrapper for a

2223
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,940
novice Sasso mechanism runs inside of

2224
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:03,900
that

2225
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,880
and um

2226
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,620
you know the best the best way to shows

2227
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,179
with the next slide I think with with

2228
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:12,480
just a small image so imagine a protocol

2229
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,739
client

2230
01:33:13,739 --> 01:33:16,739
um using an identity provider of his own

2231
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:18,000
domain

2232
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,219
and accessing a server that has never

2233
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:22,380
heard of that domain before basically

2234
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:24,120
what it does is it starts an end-to-end

2235
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,400
S6 over plus service and the nice thing

2236
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,560
of acetalk plus it mentions the domain

2237
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,320
as whom the client wants to authenticate

2238
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,719
so the foreign server can forward that

2239
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:36,060
message to the identity domain for the

2240
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:36,960
client

2241
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,940
and basically it starts bouncing back

2242
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:41,100
and forth these these encrypted packets

2243
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,139
without knowing what goes on until the

2244
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:45,780
identity domain reports back it says hey

2245
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:48,060
I got the user ID you know my domain

2246
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,980
name you verified it with DNS SEC and

2247
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:52,139
Dane and TLS and whatever

2248
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:54,420
um I'm the one who can now vouch for a

2249
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,580
username underneath that domain and here

2250
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:58,679
you have it now you have a user domain

2251
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:00,480
name kind of identity

2252
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,739
and

2253
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:03,659
um the interesting thing is Sasol is

2254
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:07,560
flexible it can negotiate a mechanism so

2255
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,719
as soon as this is supported on the

2256
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:11,699
client in the server it can do just

2257
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:13,860
about uh can work for just about any

2258
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:16,560
protocol given that the software also

2259
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,239
has the flexibility to take all the

2260
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:20,040
mechanism of course

2261
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,659
um we didn't need to change any of the

2262
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:23,460
existing protocols that's the nice thing

2263
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:26,580
they are used as they are I'm at XMP no

2264
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:29,000
changes

2265
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,800
um

2266
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,199
oh yeah sorry so what if we change this

2267
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,780
we use diameter between the form server

2268
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:42,719
and and the identity provider we only

2269
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,880
need to Define three different address

2270
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,000
value pairs for the token for uh well a

2271
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,219
few few simple things

2272
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:51,780
um and we needed to Define this new

2273
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:54,480
Cecil mechanism and that was it

2274
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:57,480
um since we got started we also added

2275
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,460
subtle to http we're presenting that

2276
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:01,440
actually next Friday in the HTTP based

2277
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,699
group

2278
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:04,380
um it's proving to be battle because

2279
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,600
HTTP is

2280
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,620
um

2281
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:10,440
well they're afraid that browser

2282
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,420
manufacturers will be uh will be will

2283
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,800
feel threatened by it and that sort of

2284
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,239
thing but I think there's many use case

2285
01:35:15,239 --> 01:35:17,219
with this is really useful

2286
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:18,719
um we have it working by the way we have

2287
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,460
a plugin for Firefox it's just an

2288
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:23,100
independent JavaScript bit of code and

2289
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,719
we have this working and we have it on

2290
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,080
the server side for Apache for nginx so

2291
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,300
this stuff really works

2292
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,580
um actually you can add it to add the

2293
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,620
two pen module for studio and containers

2294
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,900
and that sort of thing

2295
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,360
um Kerberos another story cobras

2296
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,760
actually already does realm crossover

2297
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,620
um if you get a ticket or if you ask for

2298
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:47,040
a ticket you could get a reference back

2299
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,840
and that reference basically says oh I

2300
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,100
don't know about the host you're asking

2301
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,500
for the surface go and ask that one and

2302
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,000
you continue sending your tickets

2303
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,659
requests to the other server normally uh

2304
01:35:57,659 --> 01:36:00,060
a KDC will only do that if if it has a

2305
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,100
pre-arranged key between the two candies

2306
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,080
she's the client can see the surface KDC

2307
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,360
and all we had to do there is have the

2308
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,699
kdcs to show the realm controls the

2309
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:11,400
identity controls for the realm

2310
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,100
only had to make those communicate and

2311
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,900
exchange your key

2312
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:18,540
um since that only means a change at the

2313
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,460
Domain level it means that the client

2314
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,260
doesn't have to change clients can

2315
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,900
already do this because generally they

2316
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,520
follow follow up on these instructions

2317
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:30,000
so we Define a protocol for the uh kg to

2318
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,280
KDC

2319
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,080
exchange and

2320
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,540
initially it was not safe to specify

2321
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:39,239
this host belongs to that Kerberos realm

2322
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:41,760
in DNS but we have DNS Tech now so we

2323
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,520
can now safely do that so we made a drop

2324
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,840
for that as well

2325
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,860
so um basically Kerberos with Dynamic

2326
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:51,719
ROM crossover we're actually also here

2327
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,300
talking about the TLs mode that does

2328
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,980
cobras together with Diffie hellmann

2329
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,960
diffie-hellman for the the freshness of

2330
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,300
the secrets and uh covers for having

2331
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,699
something that can't be detected with a

2332
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:04,560
quantum computer so

2333
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,920
um the two really form a very good Bond

2334
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,500
um so that's the Kerberos variant now

2335
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,239
for certificates there are two two ways

2336
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,440
officially

2337
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,020
um ldap is supposed to be used for for

2338
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:18,719
storing certificates and now that given

2339
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:21,060
the domain has a standard DNS as of E

2340
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,159
Record where you can find it so and

2341
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:26,219
there's the the format of searching for

2342
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:28,080
the objects for a certain user under a

2343
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,940
given domain are also pretty much

2344
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:32,580
standardized so it's quite quite clear

2345
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,820
how you can look for an identity there

2346
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:37,800
x59 certificates as well as PTP keys can

2347
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,480
be stored in there under your own domain

2348
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,460
name and your own control or at least at

2349
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,199
your own identity provider the guy

2350
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,420
you're paying for for doing it properly

2351
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:47,699
the way you want it done and I think

2352
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:50,159
most people now using the silos have

2353
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,659
given up on

2354
01:37:51,659 --> 01:37:54,960
um on privacy on account of apathy I

2355
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,699
can't do anything else don't know what

2356
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:58,139
to do I think it's important to have

2357
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:01,679
other options and this is one of them

2358
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,260
um something else we're going to talk to

2359
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,239
um during this conference I think is in

2360
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,580
the dance group which does client uh

2361
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:10,679
Dane I'm a modern dancer so I very much

2362
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:12,840
look forward to going there

2363
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,900
um the client Dean uh basically could

2364
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:18,360
also basically just have a root say ca

2365
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,699
for a given domain announce it in the

2366
01:38:20,699 --> 01:38:23,580
under DNS SEC uh security and basically

2367
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,760
State whatever this thing uh signs is

2368
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,620
going to be a valid client underneath

2369
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,179
this domain so that will be yet another

2370
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:34,199
way of assuring the security of the

2371
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:36,540
um um of the client identity I think it

2372
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,460
was more like yeah there's many more

2373
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,020
slides because as I said we have

2374
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:42,600
specifications we have uh a block

2375
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,540
actually and um and a lot of code so

2376
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,520
there's plenty to play around with

2377
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,239
um it's better sort of level

2378
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:52,620
um but you're quite welcome to play with

2379
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,659
it and feedback whatever you want to

2380
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:56,340
share about it

2381
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:00,060
um and plus this is uh sponsored by the

2382
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:03,120
ngi pointer project as well as Nomad

2383
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,219
um the European Union likes this kind of

2384
01:39:05,219 --> 01:39:07,020
Direction because it's very much in line

2385
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,520
with the gdpr and the Privacy

2386
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,139
consideration that the European Union

2387
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:11,159
has

2388
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,320
maybe there's also something political

2389
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,120
like we don't want to hand over or

2390
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,860
control to America I don't know about

2391
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:19,020
that but the European Union definitely

2392
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,000
likes this kind of this line of work

2393
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,340
okay thank you any questions thank you

2394
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,980
are there other slides uh so when you

2395
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,980
download this presentation from the

2396
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:31,860
research group meeting materials you'll

2397
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,600
see the other slides so thank you for

2398
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,219
that questions comments

2399
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,199
okay uh I do have a question but I think

2400
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,000
another discussion has to go on to the

2401
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,520
Middle East now I didn't figure out

2402
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,639
exactly how this across realm trust

2403
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,659
relation gets established

2404
01:39:53,659 --> 01:39:55,920
we'll have to defer that discussion

2405
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,020
because

2406
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:00,420
that's just my question

2407
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:03,980
okay thank you yeah

2408
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,380
uh if I turn it over to you I can

2409
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,780
control the slides and you just tell me

2410
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,760
yeah thank you Mark

2411
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,219
um okay yeah

2412
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:16,320
um this was a pretty interesting

2413
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,080
um meeting so far with many

2414
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:23,340
um diverse topics and um I think a kind

2415
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,199
of nicely reflects

2416
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,000
um like the broad spectrum that we have

2417
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,560
in the group

2418
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,060
and

2419
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:33,719
um so I'm not sure you notice but um the

2420
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:36,600
Charter text that we have on the um

2421
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,600
dinner G data tracker

2422
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:43,620
site is a little bit outdated and so we

2423
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:46,320
thought now could maybe could be a good

2424
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:49,500
time to revise this and say better

2425
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:53,219
formulate what we actually want to get

2426
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:56,580
out of this group what could be

2427
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:59,159
um say outcomes what could be good ways

2428
01:40:59,159 --> 01:41:02,460
of working and this is what we want to

2429
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:06,179
um get out of this discussion now so um

2430
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:08,820
so this and I have thought a little bit

2431
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,320
about this

2432
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,520
um but

2433
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,440
um so of course we didn't want to

2434
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,260
preclude too many things so this is just

2435
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:18,120
a discussion starter and we hope to get

2436
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,300
some feedback today and during the week

2437
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,600
and then also at this side meeting on on

2438
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,900
Wednesday that mentioned yeah next slide

2439
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,880
please

2440
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,940
yeah right so the the current energy

2441
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:36,420
Charter was developed several years ago

2442
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,820
um when there was

2443
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:42,000
um yeah lots of interest in essay decent

2444
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,860
flashing Technologies

2445
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:46,260
um specifically

2446
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,340
and so it covers a really broad spectrum

2447
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:51,960
including you know decentralized apps

2448
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,820
and and all these things

2449
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:57,719
and yeah over time I think we all gained

2450
01:41:57,719 --> 01:41:59,880
a bit better understanding so what could

2451
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,320
be used for contributions in this ietf

2452
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,199
irtf environment

2453
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,080
um what are really depressing issues

2454
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,300
um so I think we learned this really

2455
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,940
well also through

2456
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,639
um these workshops that we had so the

2457
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:20,760
last year workshop for example

2458
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,540
um if you haven't seen the the report

2459
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:26,639
um I highly recommend

2460
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,800
um checking that out

2461
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,320
and so

2462
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:33,780
we had seen like also today like the

2463
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,940
different types of presentations so now

2464
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:40,100
people talking about the like problem

2465
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:42,900
analysis right so

2466
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:46,260
um you know what how does how is Canon

2467
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,179
simulation be characterized how can it

2468
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:51,780
be measured perhaps we also had this

2469
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:54,080
um but then also say some more

2470
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,940
architectural thoughts um so what could

2471
01:42:56,940 --> 01:43:00,360
be say technical reasons um of course we

2472
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:03,060
know that there are many economical

2473
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:06,360
reasons as we also discussed today

2474
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,460
um but then sometimes we also like today

2475
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:11,400
we get interesting proposals that um

2476
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:15,119
fall under the um fall into this uh this

2477
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,139
topic

2478
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:18,480
and so we thought okay let's think a bit

2479
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,280
about what could we how could we

2480
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,719
structure

2481
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:26,360
um this work uh next slide please

2482
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:28,619
so maybe

2483
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:31,080
um first of all we should probably talk

2484
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,139
a bit um what the the objectives

2485
01:43:34,139 --> 01:43:37,320
um that we that we see and so now

2486
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:40,080
um clearly just just take this as a

2487
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,020
and some some initial thoughts and um we

2488
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,699
should definitely

2489
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:47,400
um talk more about this and I'm sure

2490
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,900
um you know people in the room and

2491
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,699
people in the online meeting here have

2492
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:52,320
additional ideas

2493
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,679
so what Lisha mentioned earlier is that

2494
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,119
um

2495
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,100
um I think we are in a really good

2496
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,780
um position here and I have a good

2497
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:03,360
really good opportunity to

2498
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,219
um yeah make the energy

2499
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:07,860
um the the place in the say internet ITF

2500
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:10,800
ITF Community where we would

2501
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,280
um discuss internet centralization

2502
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,980
um and the corresponding problems and

2503
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:19,320
threats but potentially also do

2504
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:22,020
something about it

2505
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:26,280
um but I mean first of all there's of as

2506
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,020
we have also seen today there's still

2507
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,020
lots of interest and and also need and

2508
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,960
we assume in you know analyzing things

2509
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:37,080
further and um

2510
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,300
pointing out the the problems further

2511
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:40,560
and so on

2512
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,920
and so we think that that that should

2513
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,040
definitely and continue and we should

2514
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,760
um you know keep on going basically

2515
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:51,360
um

2516
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:55,199
and perhaps trying to formulate some

2517
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,719
some intended outputs so like what could

2518
01:44:57,719 --> 01:44:59,940
be these useful insights so what could

2519
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:03,480
be useful recommendations and maybe also

2520
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,000
what could be technology components that

2521
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,260
we may be able to to offer and yet

2522
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:11,760
so

2523
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,280
um so before doing this we think we

2524
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,139
should continue like for example talking

2525
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:18,360
about measurements and uh analytical

2526
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,780
work on the existing internet

2527
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:25,199
um and then also create this uh base

2528
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:27,119
this base of knowledge

2529
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:30,060
um and explore Technical Solutions for

2530
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,639
say doing things differently or

2531
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:35,159
facilitating decentralized system

2532
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:37,159
development

2533
01:45:37,159 --> 01:45:41,760
and so one question is also a little bit

2534
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,360
what is the audience of of our work or

2535
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,820
what are the consumers of our great

2536
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:48,780
ideas

2537
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:52,380
and I mean private so first firstly of

2538
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,219
course

2539
01:45:53,219 --> 01:45:56,100
um we are in the internet ITF iitf

2540
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,800
community so I we assume that we could

2541
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,940
make useful contributions here but then

2542
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:06,179
um in this particular topic there's also

2543
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:10,440
the question you know could other bodies

2544
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:13,619
um other actors somehow pick this up and

2545
01:46:13,619 --> 01:46:16,380
you know learn something from our work

2546
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:19,100
so we are thinking about

2547
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:21,840
basically providing input for our

2548
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,580
Regulators for example

2549
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:26,520
so not in terms of you know telling them

2550
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,699
what to do but say giving them say

2551
01:46:29,699 --> 01:46:33,060
better information maybe also

2552
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,739
um

2553
01:46:33,739 --> 01:46:38,060
explaining better technical alternatives

2554
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:41,820
to to certain aspects of

2555
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:43,440
um so topics that we have seen today for

2556
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,580
example

2557
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:48,000
and so this is this was our like

2558
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,360
first list of objectives that we came up

2559
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,139
with and then next slide please

2560
01:46:55,139 --> 01:46:56,699
we thought okay

2561
01:46:56,699 --> 01:46:59,400
um maybe we could um you know just to

2562
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:02,280
explain better what we are doing and

2563
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:05,040
also maybe structuring the activities a

2564
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:08,219
bit say assume we have like like two

2565
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:11,040
main strengths in our work so like maybe

2566
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,960
one is more analytical

2567
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,000
so characterizing

2568
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,179
um uh centralization assessing it and so

2569
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:21,420
on and also the the the consequences

2570
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,219
that are associated

2571
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:26,280
and then maybe a second strand would be

2572
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,960
then more on

2573
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,659
um say the exploration of a

2574
01:47:30,659 --> 01:47:33,300
decentralized systems uh application

2575
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:37,380
design and so here of course we also had

2576
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,600
this discussion I think um today in the

2577
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,100
chat I saw that

2578
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,679
so what do we actually mean by that so

2579
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:46,260
that clearly needs to be so we would

2580
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:48,360
have to explain this better in the in

2581
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,520
the in a complete Charter

2582
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:54,060
and so we think decenteration is a lot

2583
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:57,119
about decentralizing control Power

2584
01:47:57,119 --> 01:47:58,500
um and

2585
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,060
um so we have

2586
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,400
decentralized systems that are

2587
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,800
technically decentralized but not from a

2588
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,600
control Power perspective and this seems

2589
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,239
to be the main issue

2590
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:11,699
um and so we would

2591
01:48:11,699 --> 01:48:13,679
um so for the shadow discussion we need

2592
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:15,540
to clarify this um

2593
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:18,480
but from a topic perspective yeah we

2594
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,159
think that this could host

2595
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,080
um like experimental Solutions

2596
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,260
experimental work maybe also some say

2597
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,300
continuous work

2598
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:30,179
um say developing something like a

2599
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:32,820
specification if we find like a

2600
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:35,460
particular technology this

2601
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:38,340
um really really important

2602
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:39,780
and

2603
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:43,920
um but also yeah having a bit this

2604
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,880
um you know space where we can

2605
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,800
exchange ideas for

2606
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,080
um you know developing

2607
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,900
future elements of the internet but

2608
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,659
perhaps not only the internet but also

2609
01:48:57,659 --> 01:49:00,659
the web so I think we should also be

2610
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:02,340
able to discuss this

2611
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:05,460
um in in this group here

2612
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,800
and I think you have another slide

2613
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,360
um if you can just

2614
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,500
write

2615
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:13,380
and so what we thought is um okay we

2616
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,460
could

2617
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:18,119
um you know of course develop this list

2618
01:49:18,119 --> 01:49:20,420
of objectives but then generally

2619
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,739
structure the work around these two

2620
01:49:22,739 --> 01:49:24,719
strands and

2621
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,960
um so of course we need to identify like

2622
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:31,080
more specific topics for continuous work

2623
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,480
um I don't think this should be defined

2624
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:37,080
top down so we we are seeing many many

2625
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,600
good ideas and

2626
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,300
um this needs to be Community

2627
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:43,860
um a German thing and we need to

2628
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,679
eventually identify things that we we

2629
01:49:46,679 --> 01:49:48,420
deem important enough or interesting

2630
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,400
enough

2631
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,780
and

2632
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:52,739
um

2633
01:49:52,739 --> 01:49:56,639
yeah so we would certainly continue like

2634
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:00,719
inviting relevant research presentations

2635
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,940
um like like today like you said just

2636
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:05,100
you know open up

2637
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:07,199
um New Horizons or just give us new

2638
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:09,780
ideas that could help us identifying

2639
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:11,460
future work

2640
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:16,020
and for our meetings like today

2641
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,880
um I was mentioned three strands there

2642
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:20,400
but so I mean we we can be fairly

2643
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,020
flexible how we run it so we sometimes

2644
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,880
we may have like workshops that focus on

2645
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,340
one very particular topic

2646
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:27,060
um

2647
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,920
uh other

2648
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:31,320
um other days like today when we have

2649
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,060
more time we could

2650
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,800
um you know

2651
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,300
um accommodate

2652
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:40,340
um very different types of work

2653
01:50:40,739 --> 01:50:42,800
um for the

2654
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,179
Charter discussion and maybe also yeah

2655
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:48,480
in general for for doing for for

2656
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,580
planning the future work better

2657
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:52,320
we think it will be good if we could

2658
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,020
identify research communities and

2659
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:56,940
relevant groups we'd like to work with

2660
01:50:56,940 --> 01:51:01,020
and um so here we are also hoping a bit

2661
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:03,840
um to get more suggestions from from the

2662
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,580
group

2663
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:08,159
um also so not only in terms of

2664
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,300
um

2665
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,639
topics but also you know co-locating

2666
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:14,280
meetings and so I think that's something

2667
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,800
we definitely want to do so meeting also

2668
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,760
outside the iitf iitf

2669
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,320
um Cycles

2670
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:26,159
and so this is what we had prepared so

2671
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:27,960
far so we deliberately

2672
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,780
um kept it on this level and we didn't

2673
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:33,420
think it's worthwhile to discuss lengthy

2674
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:34,500
shutter text

2675
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,300
um at this point

2676
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,880
and so now we'd like to open the floor

2677
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,820
for our comments feedback

2678
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,400
um better ideas

2679
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,980
thank you okay thank you Dirk

2680
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:50,340
um I'd like to open up the floor for

2681
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,500
questions or comments about this I'm

2682
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,360
going to be rude and insert myself in

2683
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,900
the queue

2684
01:51:57,239 --> 01:51:59,940
okay and Lexia wants to go too that

2685
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:02,040
folks in the front of the room

2686
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,840
um I'll take the prerogative of

2687
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,540
controlling the slides here for a moment

2688
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:08,520
yeah uh you asked a couple questions

2689
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,520
here in terms of objectives and I I just

2690
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,800
want to make three very quick comments

2691
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,600
the first was you asked about the

2692
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:18,020
audience for the work that comes out of

2693
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:21,780
dinrg and I think I think it's possible

2694
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,580
that the entire Community can benefit

2695
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:26,340
from the work that's going on here and

2696
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:27,659
by that I mean

2697
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:29,820
that some of the work that comes out of

2698
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:32,340
dinrg can inform work that goes on in

2699
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:35,040
the ietf but I also think that some of

2700
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,860
the work that's going on here can inform

2701
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:41,280
uh work that's going on in the IAB so I

2702
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,960
think that there's actually the the

2703
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,320
audience is quite broad for the work

2704
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,420
that's going on here

2705
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:49,860
um you said Dirk you said something

2706
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:52,679
really interesting in your slides about

2707
01:52:52,679 --> 01:52:55,560
measurement and in fact it appears on

2708
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,540
this slide and then measurement appears

2709
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:59,340
on this slide as well in the second

2710
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:01,500
bullet and I think one of the things

2711
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,199
that's important to us is making sure

2712
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:07,920
that we focus and clearly Define the

2713
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,020
kinds of measurement work that we would

2714
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,300
be doing because we already have a

2715
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,219
research group that does focus on

2716
01:53:14,219 --> 01:53:17,460
measurement map RG and you don't we

2717
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:19,440
don't want to duplicate that work I

2718
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,679
think that's really important

2719
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:26,100
uh my my third comment is

2720
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:26,880
um

2721
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,980
is about your last slide

2722
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:30,719
I think the two strands are pretty

2723
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,520
interesting and I

2724
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,380
um while I'm very interested in

2725
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:36,360
centralization and the effects that it

2726
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,119
has uh on the internet and on the the

2727
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:41,219
internet ecosystem I think the

2728
01:53:41,219 --> 01:53:43,639
measurement part is um just as important

2729
01:53:43,639 --> 01:53:45,480
and so

2730
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,600
um I'm going to uh on the mailing list

2731
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,980
I'm going to make suggestions around

2732
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:52,260
that I promise that I would only have

2733
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:55,920
three comments but my fourth comment

2734
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,860
my fourth comment is that anyone who uh

2735
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:01,739
has been interested in this has taken a

2736
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:04,980
look at the dinrg charter and you'll

2737
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:06,780
find that it's very long

2738
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,940
it's it's one of the longest Charters

2739
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:12,659
I've ever seen and I I think um some

2740
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:15,239
editing needs to go on there and focused

2741
01:54:15,239 --> 01:54:17,940
on like you said uh in your third slide

2742
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:20,280
on the objectives so that's just one

2743
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:22,020
person comments I'm going to go to

2744
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:25,880
elixia then Mallory then Arnold

2745
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,619
okay I think everyone need to limit the

2746
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:30,179
comments

2747
01:54:30,179 --> 01:54:32,699
I'll do myself two minutes first of all

2748
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:34,980
you mentioned about input into IB that's

2749
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:36,480
actually exactly what I wrote down there

2750
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,940
I think that we should develop a topics

2751
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:41,639
for future workshops and there could be

2752
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:44,159
potential suggestions to view workshops

2753
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,860
this is a very important uh problem area

2754
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,840
my second thing is regarding the

2755
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,460
measurement I think the measurement

2756
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:53,219
research group is perhaps more into the

2757
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:55,980
methodologies of measurement and for

2758
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,960
this group fundamentally we want to

2759
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:00,719
decide what we want to measure to

2760
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:04,699
demonstrate uh the factual things about

2761
01:55:04,699 --> 01:55:06,960
centralization what have been

2762
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,159
centralized how much has been

2763
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:10,020
centralized we need those kind of a

2764
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:11,880
harder evidence

2765
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:15,659
as a potential input into the future

2766
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:19,739
regulations policy makers because like I

2767
01:55:19,739 --> 01:55:21,119
mentioned earlier

2768
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:24,840
um in a talk that uh

2769
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,940
personally I do not believe Technical

2770
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:28,800
Solutions alone

2771
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,179
well

2772
01:55:30,179 --> 01:55:31,619
can completely address the

2773
01:55:31,619 --> 01:55:35,100
centralization problem which has economy

2774
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,179
of skill

2775
01:55:36,179 --> 01:55:40,260
the big factor as a big Dragon Force

2776
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:44,040
my third thing adding into the charter

2777
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,320
region is that this group should produce

2778
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,000
documentations

2779
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,520
helping the entire Community to fully

2780
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,860
understand you know the the problem

2781
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:54,300
space

2782
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:57,360
like for example marks the taxonomy I

2783
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,760
think is a great starting point to uh

2784
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,440
Define the terminologies uh

2785
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:06,719
characterize the centralizations in the

2786
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:07,920
different

2787
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,699
sub domains whatever so that we have the

2788
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:13,760
responsibility to actually

2789
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,619
articulate and clarify the entire

2790
01:56:16,619 --> 01:56:19,139
problem space not like currently I think

2791
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:21,000
we have a broad

2792
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,340
trading that internet get decentralized

2793
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:25,619
I mean I think we need to go more

2794
01:56:25,619 --> 01:56:29,400
qualitative and quantitative as well

2795
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:32,219
okay uh Mallory let me uh let you have

2796
01:56:32,219 --> 01:56:33,840
the microphone and then our note after

2797
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,360
you you have to push our node out of the

2798
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:39,259
way is what you have to do

2799
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:43,340
Okay so

2800
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,739
hey everybody Mallory Noodle from the

2801
01:56:46,739 --> 01:56:49,260
center for democracy and technology so I

2802
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,880
actually remember the first time I came

2803
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,800
to one of your meetings it was in London

2804
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,840
and it was however many years ago that

2805
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,060
was what 2018

2806
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:58,260
um and at the time I was super

2807
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:00,060
interested in it because I knew folks

2808
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:02,520
from UCL who came with their work around

2809
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:06,060
a distributed Ledger technology and I

2810
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:07,199
was you know working with someone there

2811
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:09,900
at the time and I I thought I think we

2812
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:12,060
all thought maybe then that the

2813
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:13,500
distributed Ledger technology and the

2814
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,480
blockchain and all that was going to

2815
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,980
solve a lot of interesting problems or

2816
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,440
at least attempt to I was I would I

2817
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,000
would be proud to call myself a skeptic

2818
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,619
even back then

2819
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:25,739
um but I wonder how much of this major

2820
01:57:25,739 --> 01:57:27,900
and I would call this like a major shift

2821
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:30,900
in um Charter and mandate

2822
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:33,420
has to do with two things one is the

2823
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:36,239
word distributed is very ambiguous it's

2824
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:37,679
been used in a lot of different ways

2825
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:39,239
people are constantly confused about

2826
01:57:39,239 --> 01:57:41,460
what we mean when we say it and then two

2827
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:43,199
the second trend is that well like the

2828
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:44,760
blockchain stuff didn't really work out

2829
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:47,040
to be all of that super interesting

2830
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,480
there's still a lot of interesting work

2831
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,580
I don't want to knock it down but I

2832
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:52,800
think there was a lot of Promise then

2833
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,260
that this would be a really rich space

2834
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,719
for the ietf and the irtf in particular

2835
01:57:57,719 --> 01:57:59,880
to research and we're not seeing maybe

2836
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,739
as much of that and

2837
01:58:01,739 --> 01:58:03,599
so I think those two Trends mean that

2838
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:05,760
there's been a lot of Charter creep and

2839
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,800
I just wish there were I would ask maybe

2840
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,599
this is a request instead of just

2841
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,300
ranting about it maybe ask for folks

2842
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:13,800
who've been involved in this work a lot

2843
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,199
more consistently than I am I have been

2844
01:58:16,199 --> 01:58:19,099
to connect the dots a little bit more

2845
01:58:19,099 --> 01:58:22,560
explicitly between

2846
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:27,000
blockchain stuff and solving

2847
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,739
consolidation and competition and

2848
01:58:28,739 --> 01:58:30,300
centralization of the internet because

2849
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:31,800
those are

2850
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:34,199
um really there's a bunch of space in

2851
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:36,179
between those things for me still

2852
01:58:36,179 --> 01:58:38,219
I think in terms of a documentation

2853
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:41,099
development we should have at least one

2854
01:58:41,099 --> 01:58:43,440
documentation to articulate exactly the

2855
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,420
points I mean the problem the question

2856
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:47,820
you risk

2857
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,580
I'm not quickly my friend yep very quick

2858
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:52,380
in fact it's very strange for the first

2859
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:54,360
time Mallory we agree on something

2860
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:57,239
so I have the same issue yeah I think

2861
01:58:57,239 --> 01:59:00,060
there is a methodology issue between

2862
01:59:00,060 --> 01:59:02,760
connecting the dots and I I would I

2863
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,440
would urge that

2864
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,900
you don't have two problems to resolve

2865
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:09,599
quickly like measurements and

2866
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,880
the other one but you need to have a

2867
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:14,280
methodology that assumes if you would

2868
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:17,040
have enough analytics and they would be

2869
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,260
good and you should have enough data on

2870
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:21,599
a number of things so how does it

2871
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:24,060
connect to centralization

2872
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:26,400
so again

2873
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,800
my point is that maybe you could look at

2874
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:31,020
another part which is not here which is

2875
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:32,699
the design issue

2876
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:35,820
how does design influences up to the

2877
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:37,619
other Associated issues you have

2878
01:59:37,619 --> 01:59:40,739
including the centralization piece and

2879
01:59:40,739 --> 01:59:42,420
going you know for me speaking going

2880
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:44,820
other areas than our area because I

2881
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:47,820
don't think we in I.T Telecom and so on

2882
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:50,159
are going to give the answer in history

2883
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:52,380
you can see a number of things in other

2884
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:55,860
societies in the 20th century where

2885
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:58,560
people tried things on the real good

2886
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,440
intention and it failed because the

2887
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,599
leaders realized what it would create at

2888
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:06,440
the upper level so go back to design

2889
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:09,000
look at what is the theory of design

2890
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,060
look at how it is influencing up to

2891
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:14,639
society legal ethics anthropology

2892
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:15,960
Society

2893
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,940
um and so on and you will find many

2894
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:21,000
examples and this could help you to ah

2895
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,340
this is how you connect the dots and

2896
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,500
then you can put all the materials you

2897
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,719
want to attach that methodology

2898
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:31,520
that's my feedback thank you okay okay

2899
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:36,300
uh Colin Perkins uh

2900
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:38,159
I think there's a bunch of really nice

2901
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:39,360
ideas for

2902
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,639
uh and I think there's a basis for a

2903
02:00:41,639 --> 02:00:43,260
really nice restructuring of the chart

2904
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,420
so here

2905
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:46,380
um

2906
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:50,699
what strikes me is that it the the way

2907
02:00:50,699 --> 02:00:53,400
this is written reads like some internet

2908
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:56,940
measurement protocol people wrote it

2909
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,560
and I suppose that makes sense since you

2910
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,500
are internet measurement protocol people

2911
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,580
um there's not perhaps as much focus on

2912
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:07,739
economics or societal issues and

2913
02:01:07,739 --> 02:01:10,619
understanding those aspects as the

2914
02:01:10,619 --> 02:01:14,219
prevalent domain might require

2915
02:01:14,219 --> 02:01:16,679
so a really nice start here but I'd

2916
02:01:16,679 --> 02:01:18,000
encourage you to think perhaps a little

2917
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,780
bit more broadly

2918
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:24,179
okay that's okay

2919
02:01:24,179 --> 02:01:27,480
perhaps let me just get Dirk to

2920
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:29,219
intervene here on what the next steps I

2921
02:01:29,219 --> 02:01:31,139
assume the discussion will move to the

2922
02:01:31,139 --> 02:01:33,619
mailing list

2923
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:38,099
um yeah so first of all um thanks a lot

2924
02:01:38,099 --> 02:01:39,119
everybody

2925
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:40,800
um it was really good feedback and the

2926
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,080
points are really taking so well I I got

2927
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:45,719
I understood Mallory's points um

2928
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:49,199
and Collins points um so

2929
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:51,420
that was exactly the plan so we just we

2930
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:54,480
just put this out now to get this kind

2931
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:58,020
of feedback and um so

2932
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,000
um responding to Colin also is

2933
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,599
especially on this a more constructive

2934
02:02:02,599 --> 02:02:06,900
elements of of the work and

2935
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:09,179
um I mean we're not in a rush here right

2936
02:02:09,179 --> 02:02:11,460
so we can really take time discuss this

2937
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:16,080
uh in in a like orderly way and then get

2938
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:17,820
out something that is really really

2939
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:21,239
useful so what we are going to do now is

2940
02:02:21,239 --> 02:02:22,500
um collect

2941
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,440
um the feedback today and analyze it and

2942
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,940
um

2943
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:28,440
um follow up on it for for this

2944
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:31,500
Wednesday meeting and so we hope that

2945
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:34,080
um and then make the next say more

2946
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,300
concrete proposal of this and we hope

2947
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,040
that many of you can can make it to that

2948
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,560
meeting and then um let's just continue

2949
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,599
um working on this

2950
02:02:42,599 --> 02:02:44,040
thank you very much it was a great

2951
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:45,599
meeting

2952
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:47,580
thanks everybody for bringing their work

2953
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:50,760
and for the really good discussion also

2954
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,199
