opening then we're going to have a

91
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,759

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,139
been discussing a little bit in in the

94
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,539
past uh then we have

95
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,699
um a new work to be presented so Chic

96
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,000
convergence profile from Sergio and a

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,759
discussion about IDs that is going to be

98
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,380
led by Lauren

99
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,780
and so we have about an hour and a half

100
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,840
for today's meeting so do you have uh

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,479
any other work that you would like to to

102
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,699
discuss on today's meeting

103
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,060
two minutes slowly yes so there is a new

104
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,919
item we will include so two minutes from

105
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,720
Dominic about the hackathon because

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,280
there were some really interesting uh

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,199
work that has been done so we'll be

108
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,720
adding this one

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,460
you can start at the beginning I think

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,740
it's good to see a couple of words did

111
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,360
you send a slide that much in it

112
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,880
if you like yes yes sure but you'll have

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
just a few minutes

114
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,860
yeah yes yes so the the question was if

115
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,800
Dominica so Dominic asked if he needs to

116
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,560
upload sites for for this and yes if you

117
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,300
can upload a couple of slides yes but

118
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,580
it's not like a I mean you can just

119
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,800
orally present it as well

120
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,539
yes just all right

121
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,460
so any other items that you would like

122
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,900
to discuss today

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,120
no because because the key members are

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,460
going before the end of the meeting

125
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,560
and so yes it would make sense we wanted

126
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,139
to do that but we will be losing a few

127
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,180
members

128
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,099
so that's why sorry Eric yeah that's

129
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,539
that's we also wanted to do this yes yes

130
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,400
that was a very good proposal but you're

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,220
perfectly right but uh we need to keep

132
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,599
that one

133
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,319
okay so uh uh can you switch to the next

134
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,520
slide

135
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,120
please

136
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,219
okay

137
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,300
so the working group status things are

138
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,599
advancing uh pretty well uh so I think

139
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,419
that so in in all working group items we

140
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,380
have a serious uh I mean we're always at

141
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,559
uh we're always almost uh finalize the

142
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,059
work on the on the open working group

143
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,620
items and we'll be talking more about

144
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,860
the status of NBA at you and sick Fox

145
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,360
and there are some working group items

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
that we'll need to discuss you know how

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,680
things are going to evolve uh uh from

148
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,080
here on

149
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,899
so uh here the the

150
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,779
on the shake shakeover sigfox and the

151
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,380
compound deck so we are almost there uh

152
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,440
we are only waiting for uh the final

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,620
touches I think there is the uh the

154
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,380
shepherd uh so Anna is The Shepherd of

155
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,040
uh the Chic over sick Fox and is to to

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,620
push the button uh I think that's the

157
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,800
only thing that is remaining uh

158
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,519
and on the compound deck I'm just

159
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,620
waiting for the latest revision to be

160
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,120
published with the there was there were

161
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,640
some nits uh I think they were fixed in

162
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,580
the GitHub version but I just wait for

163
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,580
them to be published as a in the data

164
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,680
tracker and it's it's good for me so

165
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,320
I'll push the button and it will be sent

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,899
off to the LSG so yes Sergio

167
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,420
uh yes I will check the the component

169
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,620
version with all the corrections

170
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,720
so maybe we can check that or else I

171
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,519
would publish a new version after the

172
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,320
meeting I I don't think it was on the

173
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,540
data tracker with you know there were

174
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,060
some needs it's really minor stuff but I

175
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,380
don't think it was in the data tracker

176
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,940
they were not fixed in a data tracker

177
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,160
yeah I I think they are but I will check

178
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,080
it then yes okay please double check and

179
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,339
it's good for me I'll push the button

180
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,220
later just just right after

181
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,740
yes and Anna I'm not sure if you're

182
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,800
hearing me about the the yes so Anna is

183
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,560
in the queue if you can say if if she

184
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
covers see foxy is good for you and if

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,320
you're ready to push the button

186
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,700
hello yes for me we are waiting for the

187
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,880
end of the last call

188
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,760
so I can press the water when when you

189
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,620
tell me

190
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,600
well let's press the button then okay

191
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
okay push push the button

192
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,220
okay

193
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,579
okay

194
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,660
as a Shepherd needs to push the button

195
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:01,380
if the button is active for you if you

196
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,000
tell us you're ready we can just press

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,140
it

198
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,140
okay

199
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,360
okay so so that's that's good that's

200
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,399
that's excellent now on the document

201
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,140
advancement so we have the young data

202
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,800
model so the work uh has it's it's done

203
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,959
right right now it's in the editor's

204
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,079
queue and I think that was a huge amount

205
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,660
of work and uh with Pascal we would like

206
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,880
to thank everyone that has been working

207
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
very actively the whole working group

208
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
and Laurent Anna for for really uh

209
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,339
taking the pain and taking the like the

210
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,440
the effort to to making sure that we

211
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,079
have this good young data model that was

212
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,279
you know we were waiting for that

213
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,579
document and so thank you both uh uh

214
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,860
it's really an amazing work

215
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,600
so we're just waiting for the number I

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,459
don't think we have the number yet of

217
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,439
the the RFC but it's coming

218
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,920
so excellent work there uh nbiut uh

219
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,800
mostly so it's also very well Advanced

220
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,560
the shakeover nbiut so there are the the

221
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,779
exchanges with the uh uh of course the

222
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,260
liaison with the 3gpp that is currently

223
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,380
uh again being uh being discussed but

224
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,560
the work is uh done there has been a lot

225
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,899
of reviews from the isg that that went

226
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,019
really well uh and uh I think there is

227
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,399
only one discus that's going to be

228
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,959
cleared so uh it's good to go and again

229
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,320
amazing work there from from the authors

230
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,300
uh yes Pascal wants to say something

231
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,160
yeah I'm sorry for the interrupt I just

232
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,720
want to say that I've never seen the

233
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,399
document going so smoothly through the

234
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,779
asgq

235
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,940
so don't ask me but I think it means

236
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,160
it's an excellent document

237
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,019
and lyric if you want to chime in but no

238
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,639
I don't think there is even a discuss I

239
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,019
mean you think it's just gonna fly

240
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,380
and and enough for the whole yes

241
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,880
there were a lot of exchanges a lot of

242
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,180
work by Anna and the ASG very very yeah

243
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,000
regarding the NBA iot Pascal and myself

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,519
and Dominic was there as well at the

245
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,720
3gpp liaison meeting on Tuesday lunch

246
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,480
the they were really welcoming for the

247
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,360
work so if Enterprise wants to continue

248
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,639
their work and it becomes part of 3gpp

249
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,519
they are wide open to submit a

250
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,240
if you're an SID and work ID

251
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,560
but of course it's not the ITF to do it

252
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,300
right so if you really want to get the

253
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,360
work done there into the 3gpp standards

254
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,120
the door is open now regarding the

255
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
document itself

256
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,560
um it will be reviewed by 3gpp in next

257
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,440
week we may expect maybe a review the

258
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,339
week after so I would wait until end of

259
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,360
November to reassess last discuss about

260
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
how we do

261
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,620
the informative part

262
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,160
versus the normative part so don't touch

263
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,320
now put in sleep mode for two with two

264
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,740
three weeks

265
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,899
thank you very much thanks Eric for for

266
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,660
that clarification so again uh a really

267
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,760
amazing work I think it's um

268
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,139
uh

269
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,000
I mean we're very happy with how things

270
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,820
are are moving

271
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,399
um so we discussed the compound deck in

272
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,560
the shake of our sigfox so they're going

273
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,200
to be submitted in the in the in the

274
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
next week

275
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,540
we could shoot

276
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,959
so there is the document of the oam and

277
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,139
the question is uh of course if there is

278
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,920
still interest in continuing that work

279
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,920
uh of the current authors if there are

280
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,860
going to be new new people that can join

281
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,660
the the work

282
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,740
right so that that's an open question

283
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,800
Dominic maybe can tell us a word about

284
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,380
this Dominic you're supposed to press

285
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,000
the button to ask for the queue but

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,360
that's okay

287
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,339
so it doesn't really matter

288
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,139
um as far as I'm concerned uh I'm

289
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,260
interested in continuing this work and I

290
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,079
may have even more time on my hands in a

291
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,440
few months okay that's perfect Dominic

292
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,839
we're very happy to hear that yes and I

293
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,459
think it's uh it's it's an important

294
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,820
document and uh we're all I think Lauren

295
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,740
anyone speaking for them are still

296
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,420
interested in that topic since they are

297
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,279
implementing it so I think we're good

298
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,579
okay so that's good so everything is

299
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,519
still alive and uh um and we'll have

300
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,820
advancement okay so uh Pascal you can

301
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,880
say a couple of words on architecture so

302
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,279
the architecture has progressed with

303
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,459
regard to the description of how Chic

304
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,100
works on any type of connectivity

305
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,860
meaning that we recognize that there is

306
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,720
a session between a device and an

307
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,459
application core

308
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,399
and that session was implicit in the

309
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,100
case of classical lp1 networks so all

310
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,839
the provinces were well known there was

311
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,839
no really negotiation but we figure that

312
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
on more diverse type of networks then

313
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,560
there will be a need for something more

314
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,600
and so the architecture is preparing for

315
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,920
that and the Reach Out frame will

316
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,680
prepare for that as well

317
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,399
um as we take that path we will have to

318
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,040
work on how we identify the session what

319
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,139
what kind of data is maintained together

320
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,440
with the session so that's also part of

321
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,180
the discussions that we hope we will

322
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,060
have today and that we have started in

323
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,459
an informal meeting between between the

324
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,920
usual to authors but basically that will

325
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,320
be the course subject of the end of this

326
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,660
meeting today

327
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,959
Bob Moskowitz I made a comment on this

328
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:58,740
draft

329
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,620
back when I think this this version came

330
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,600
out that the security section is

331
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,299
incomplete it only has security security

332
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,880
above transport it does not have

333
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,919
security below transport I.E ESP ipsec

334
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,319
um it's not in there at all and the

335
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,359
implications when security is below

336
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,780
transport and what you do for for within

337
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,459
that security envelope compression the

338
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,900
higher levels particularly if you're

339
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,760
running a tunnel and the rest of that

340
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,860
that is not in the architecture and

341
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,320
should be added to the architecture sure

342
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,900
at the same time that we ex we discover

343
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,440
the fact that we are not working on a

344
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,500
closed link like loja or sigfox and we

345
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,140
go over full then we need to to look at

346
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,840
all this before that it was the layer 2

347
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,700
security it was just a direct layer of

348
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,320
two connectivity so again it was all

349
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,960
implicit and and now we have to make it

350
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,419
explicit and we have to discuss it

351
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,640
so that's part of the of the Chic over

352
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,500
full re-chartering discussion and the

353
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,799
architecture will cover that okay a new

354
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,720
health will be welcome that's right I I

355
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,220
just signed myself up something else

356
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,260
yeah

357
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,000
well congratulations we have five

358
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,559
fingers you only subscribed to four

359
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,100
right now

360
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,740
okay so uh thank you thank you thank you

361
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,200
Bob uh and we will have a new work

362
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
presented today or some convergence

363
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,360
so uh this is where we will be entering

364
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,480
the discussion about the rechartering so

365
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,600
uh Pascal you can lead the discussion

366
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,880
we'll try to have it like we have a 15

367
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,600
minutes I think to to assign this one so

368
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,620
we we already had started that Richard

369
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,840
discussion uh last day ATF and the

370
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,460
number of interim

371
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,720
and we are kind of accumulating the list

372
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,120
of things we would wish to work on

373
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,120
and that list that you see on this slide

374
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,900
is becoming serious and at the same time

375
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,100
we kind of rapidly consume the list of

376
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,900
documents that we are working on because

377
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,600
they are rapidly passing to the isg

378
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,539
we've seen nbiot we've seen the data

379
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,299
model which are pretty much through and

380
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,760
coming up are the seek Fox document and

381
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,620
the compound act which are pretty much

382
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,960
done for this working group as well

383
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,039
so I think a chair that it's really time

384
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,919
that we work on this free chart ring and

385
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,059
we start proposing text to to the ad if

386
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,780
you don't mind the rig and the the the

387
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,880
subjects that are uh that are listed

388
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,700
here are basically you know taking the

389
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,000
the the feel of the group whether we

390
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,679
want to work on those items so these are

391
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,740
the items that we have kind of uh found

392
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,539
we could be working on

393
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,120
first one is so please feel free to come

394
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,100
to the mic and say oh we can't work on

395
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,780
this or yes I would like to work on that

396
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,419
or just raise sales maybe we can do some

397
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,860
sure for instance if people are

398
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,660
interested in subjects if you can

399
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,600
rapidly go through for instance so first

400
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,360
thing is as you know we are chartered

401
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,059
for four Technologies

402
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,320
um one of them is actually being

403
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,240
processed a different group because uh

404
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,880
careless work is done at six low on 15

405
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,320
4.

406
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,820
um and the other Technologies we have

407
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,140
done at home

408
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,360
now we discovered a lot of new fools

409
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
there is PPP we tried to to push the

410
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,760
work on PPP at the interior but the

411
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,520
skills and interests were not there

412
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,320
so probably would like to to take it

413
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,120
back here

414
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,880
um there is there is interest in generic

415
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,200
AP the tunnels there is interest on a

416
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,020
new Aviation radio technology called nav

417
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,539
link and and we have effectively hands

418
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,960
with a lot of fingers on them ready to

419
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,780
start working on this so that's the

420
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,720
first shutter item any comment on Chico

421
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,280
is it something that seems to raise

422
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,620
interest in this in this group

423
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,340
yes so

424
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,860
and Carlos on the mic

425
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,039
is

426
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,580
I do have uh interest in and I I support

427
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,039
the the topics

428
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,340
I see that we are expanding the

429
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,260
usage of chic Beyond lp1

430
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,360
and that's clear from the from the list

431
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,400
that we see here and the fact that we

432
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,320
are having to discuss sometimes with

433
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,120
interiors and some topics have been

434
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,799
discussed in six law

435
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,780
so

436
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,419
as much as I support the the work of

437
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,720
these topics I wonder if this recharging

438
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,299
should also consider

439
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,400
changing the name of the group or the

440
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,140
scope so that

441
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,960
it's clear that it's not focusing only

442
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,780
on lp1

443
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,140
or if if what what is to do because

444
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,280
um

445
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
Chic is definitely a generic technology

446
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,600
that can be applied over multiple areas

447
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
it was created with the purpose of lp1

448
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,480
but if we rename it like the group to be

449
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,600
called check really if anything else

450
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,559
I don't know

451
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,940
um

452
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,039
yeah I mean what you propose one callous

453
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,520
is indeed logical and sensible the only

454
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,140
thing if I remember correctly another

455
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,700
working group wanted to change its name

456
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,440
as well that was no way

457
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,600
right it's simply a tooling system in

458
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,240
data tracker that makes things complex

459
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,419
so I can ask again

460
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,220
but in it is normal lp1 so we should

461
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,720
create the sheet Group which is kind of

462
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,480
cool as well but that would be neat yes

463
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,240
so second item is is fake fragment so

464
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,320
this one does not really take

465
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,200
re-chartering it's about providing a new

466
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,659
method

467
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,159
within chic

468
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,220
for handling fragments loss and

469
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,340
basically instead of doing

470
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,179
an arc or Knack type of arq Technology

471
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:04,799
we would use for their correction

472
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,960
instead meaning that we sent more bits

473
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,000
than we need to in case some of them are

474
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,780
lost

475
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,600
so that's that item we can take within

476
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,960
the current Charter

477
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,080
not instead of or but in addition to oh

478
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,020
yeah you may still have arq with SEC yes

479
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,640
it's just a nuance

480
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,919
okay because you mean they could be both

481
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,360
active at the same time that's what you

482
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,780
have in mind yeah okay so harq

483
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,720
that's what hrq means I breed they are Q

484
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,340
that's when fake energy works together

485
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,100
so we need to rephrase this as being haq

486
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,020
fragments

487
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,419
um then Chic header

488
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,780
so we have Bob has that document at

489
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,100
interior whereby we will be asking for a

490
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,000
new

491
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,140
um protocol type a new ether type and

492
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,419
probably a new Portman port number as

493
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:58,080
well

494
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,100
for UDP

495
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,360
unless I'm wrong I'll just make a quick

496
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,480
report of that we did get uh

497
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,240
um the the int area

498
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,700
um chair and interior A.D interesting

499
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,419
that we had the same ad uh has agreed to

500
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,900
expand beyond that they accepted my my

501
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,720
proposal for a protocol number

502
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,280
for awesome ether type and for a uh of

503
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,659
UDP Port

504
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,900
udb Port is actually transport area and

505
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,179
uh the 80 over there David black says

506
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,000
that it's fairly straightforward in the

507
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,380
wording he doesn't see that and if we

508
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,000
word it properly they'll just go through

509
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,820
straight through for The Ether type we

510
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,880
are the ram lats there is a new draft

511
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
coming out for how to interact between

512
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,039
ITF and IEEE and we will be the ones who

513
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,600
will figure out whether it's just so

514
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,880
that they got that right or it needs

515
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,919
more work so for those who have been

516
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,480
working with me who want it as an ether

517
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,860
type I don't want it as an ether type

518
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,900
but I'm willing to do the work for that

519
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,080
we're going to be the lab rats for that

520
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,260
um liaison between ietf and IEEE yes and

521
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,840
we thank donix East Lake

522
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,539
was proposed to help us on that and

523
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,179
writing this document and a number of us

524
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,020
are participating to the IEEE ITF

525
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,580
coordination meeting and so we'll raise

526
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,900
that question at the coordination

527
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
meeting as well so we need to talk to

528
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,279
Russell I think he's already aware that

529
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,799
we probably need to just ping him to say

530
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,600
Hey you would like this topic at the

531
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,140
next IEEE coordination meeting

532
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,760
um

533
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,559
there comes as a natural

534
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,820
extension to that work I mean having a

535
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,320
protocol type is good we did a protocol

536
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,940
either to go with it

537
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,520
and we probably need to figure if this

538
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,919
is always seen as nepalier protocol or

539
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,880
if there are cases for making it a IPv6

540
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,640
extension header as well I was kind of

541
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,200
the only one on the mailing list trying

542
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
to say hey we might need it as an

543
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,760
extension header as well

544
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,580
um it might be that some more people get

545
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,580
to to that thinking that maybe we also

546
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,480
need a next header

547
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,200
in which case it's kind of

548
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,460
straightforward it's just that there are

549
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,080
two Registries there is the V4 and the

550
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,720
V6 registries

551
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,039
okay

552
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,159
um so for uh to have a protocol number

553
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,200
of the advantage is that it can work on

554
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
ipv4 and IPv6 if we have an extension

555
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,440
either it will work only on IPv6 but if

556
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,539
now we have a port number

557
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,340
so I think we don't have any more

558
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,200
problem of interpretability between

559
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,679
these two version FIP and we can go on

560
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,799
extension for IPv6 and CIP before we'll

561
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,440
use UDP and Port which so we'll continue

562
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,840
on the mailing list but there seems to

563
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,559
be growing interest in asking that the

564
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,159
the protocol type is also written as a

565
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,539
next header in the IPv6 registry

566
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:04,620
uh adding uh

567
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,299
Chic in an extension header raise a lot

568
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,840
of negative comments on the int area of

569
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,059
mailing lists they were extremely

570
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:18,059
against

571
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,059
um extension headers for this they are

572
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,299
very much for the protocol number but

573
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,640
you'd have to go back in the archive to

574
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,440
see all the points they raised up

575
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,799
against extensions header and it would

576
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,360
have to be somebody here who knows an

577
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,400
awful lot more than me about this area

578
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,100
to try to to bring it up again in

579
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,140
interior

580
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,480
it's irrigating again

581
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,940
so we can discuss here right I have no

582
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,740
problem with it but it's interior draft

583
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,840
but it will be adopted shortly yeah

584
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,940
right as soon as Bob will add the text

585
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,880
for the UDP port and data type even a

586
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,440
couple of link it will mostly be adopted

587
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,320
in Terraria so please comment on this

588
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,918
interior

589
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,299
yeah we we need to figure out if we want

590
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,400
it inside before we bother anybody I

591
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,320
guess but if we could do a quick round

592
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,700
on the mailing list just to figure

593
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,799
whether I want it if we want it we need

594
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,200
to discuss with interior maybe they say

595
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,419
yes they say no but we don't even know

596
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,580
if we want it before we buy our Interior

597
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,460
right I need the use cases for those in

598
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,320
that draft I'll need what is the use

599
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
case for is an ether type what is the

600
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,679
use case for for

601
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,620
UDP Port that is the second fly

602
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,820
otherwise

603
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,220
okay so it makes full sense so the the

604
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,200
discussion for recharing for us is

605
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,320
whether it's a protocol header or a

606
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,639
extension header we still need to

607
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,279
range no no the format of high there's

608
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,620
not the value of the protocol type

609
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,020
if UDP has a header with eight bytes

610
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,360
right what header do we need for shake

611
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,940
to carry our session

612
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,940
we we we are defining a new session for

613
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,080
lp1

614
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
yes we need to rethink but basically

615
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,740
having a protocol type is not enough

616
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,020
unless you have zero byte to carry in

617
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,760
your protocol header but we probably

618
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,260
want to carry something like a session

619
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,419
ID and stuff

620
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,100
that's what that's what that's what this

621
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,380
thing is right this is not the interior

622
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,140
work this is a reach out to work for us

623
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,539
to figure out what our sessions are how

624
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,100
we identify them what needs to be

625
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,840
carried on The Wire when the session is

626
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,159
not implicit maybe I'm being naive but

627
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,120
the uh the Chic header that I might

628
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,580
carry over

629
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,100
um was Sheikh being the protocol number

630
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,039
will quite depend on the particular use

631
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,440
case whether that header basically

632
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,140
doesn't really even exist I've just said

633
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,000
this that the rule tells you what it is

634
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,799
or I have to have some sort of

635
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,020
compressed content so I don't think that

636
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,940
there's any work to do around that you

637
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,520
already have the basic concept and it is

638
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,399
basically going to be on a a usage case

639
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,820
basis just as you already have in seek

640
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,740
do you have any hair depends on what the

641
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,500
what the I mean the most may be here is

642
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,080
the ID number and that's it could be

643
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,299
just just just one but anyway because

644
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,860
that's the that's getting we need to

645
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,899
discuss because the people that are

646
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,820
remote if you can announce who is

647
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,980
speaking in and raise the hand and there

648
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,080
was also Stewart that wanted to to

649
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,539
interject at some point okay so I I but

650
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,000
it's thanks to it yes Stuart I was still

651
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,820
interested in in speaking to the mic

652
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,260
because a couple of times and I don't

653
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,520
want to interrupt people that are

654
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,279
speaking okay sorry still

655
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,700
um so yeah I mean the bottom line is we

656
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,320
are identifying the concept of the

657
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,840
session right now uh we call it the Chic

658
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,000
instance we're identifying the kind of

659
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,039
information that is stored in that

660
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,679
session and synchronize agreed upon

661
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,679
between the two parties the endpoints

662
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,659
and depending on the case effectively as

663
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,240
Bob is saying it's more or less implicit

664
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,320
what we would Define probably is

665
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,480
the list of things that in the worst

666
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,600
case must be passed and how you pass

667
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,460
only what you need to pass depending on

668
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,260
the use case boiling down to zero if you

669
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,340
need nothing

670
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,380
and probably the right way of saying

671
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,760
that of other way here is sick again

672
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,919
right it's the rest Simplicity is

673
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,539
compressed but it's the same header

674
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,820
which can be fully compressed so that's

675
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,500
how I figure out

676
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,419
um

677
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,720
OEM is we have started the work that was

678
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,460
interest we saw that the student trust

679
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,080
but we don't have a charter item for it

680
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,580
so it's kind of an obvious Charter

681
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,679
attempt for us

682
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,340
session setup that one is a big one as

683
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,039
soon as we are not anymore in a

684
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,020
completely controlled loja environments

685
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,179
or type a stick facts environment where

686
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,640
we program both ends manually Etc

687
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,760
then there is a need for a device and an

688
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,860
application to agree on a set of rules

689
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,020
make sure that they download the same

690
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,480
set of rows that it is protected against

691
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,860
impersonation or any episodes of attacks

692
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,600
the rules need to be downloaded

693
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,880
installed instantiated meaning if there

694
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,039
is your IP in it the IP is probably not

695
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
in the rule you have to instantiate it

696
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,000
inside the rule when you install it raw

697
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,140
Etc

698
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,440
yes and uh so I I just wanted to to add

699
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,960
a point here throughout the the lifetime

700
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,960
of the different drafts that became rfcs

701
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,779
we got a lot oftentimes to get reviews

702
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,360
from the iesg and they were asking okay

703
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,520
how are what about you know setting up

704
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,380
these rules how are you going to like

705
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,659
all this that is put here about the

706
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,640
session setup rule Discovery and all

707
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,860
that in the security of it we had that

708
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,720
questions in the past like people from

709
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,580
the SG were asking how are you going to

710
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,279
do that in a generic setup and we until

711
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,960
now I was like okay well we configure

712
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,779
it's a problem for later right now we

713
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,520
have solved that like we have the shake

714
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,440
the foundation and I think it's really

715
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,020
the time to you know we have the the the

716
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,179
the background the knowledge the

717
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,980
foundation to be actually able to

718
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,260
address these specific questions right

719
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,240
now right I think before that it would

720
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,340
have been premature it would have been

721
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,380
trying to solve it

722
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,320
uh sorry

723
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,380
uh yes and uh and about the the Yang the

724
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,840
optimizations for for core conf so Luhan

725
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,340
is going to be talking also about this

726
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,200
but that's that's really important like

727
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,779
core confidence uh advancing really well

728
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,960
at um at the core working group and uh

729
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,299
the way both are going to be uh working

730
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,100
together that's also an important Point

731
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,380
how do we have the most efficient and

732
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,039
the most uh uh uh uh the most way of

733
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,940
using core conf over uh uh over Shake

734
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,799
um so I'm giving the word to Lauren who

735
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,539
he was next in the waiting line and then

736
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,059
to Bob who who

737
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,159
so hold on please yes security is very

738
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,260
important and here we we have different

739
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,779
bullets that the the trade security

740
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,840
maybe it will be good to have a bullet

741
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,399
that says secure the architecture

742
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,860
securing the artificial of chic or

743
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,919
something to be very explicit well we

744
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,480
don't need to reach out for that I mean

745
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,340
that's missing in our existing

746
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,440
architecture and then Bob mentioned it

747
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,260
so we we love we we need to beef up the

748
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,418
security section of the architecture but

749
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,099
we don't need to reach out to for that I

750
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:11,879
guess

751
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,040
but yes I mean it's an obvious I mean

752
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,300
nothing would pass without it and

753
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,280
certainly

754
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,980
um with regard to the negotiation of the

755
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,119
street group

756
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,760
um um functions for the rule between

757
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,800
parties I'll point out that Daniel

758
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,699
Miguel already has a draft for uh for

759
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,560
running over Ike

760
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,280
for how to compress ESP

761
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,440
so that is a good starting point taking

762
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,500
Daniel's uh um draft

763
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,379
and my highly biased opinion is that we

764
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,679
only want to do this over a peer-to-peer

765
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,899
control a secure control Channel not a

766
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,179
client server which pretty much limits

767
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,000
us to Ike and hip as the only two

768
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,399
peer-to-peer secure control channels

769
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,040
here I have had comments that maybe TLS

770
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,980
kind of can be tricked into this uh thus

771
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,280
maybe dtls but it is problematic unless

772
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,839
you really know who's so when we get

773
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,240
into this draft there's going to be the

774
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,820
basic question is it only a peer-to-peer

775
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,220
a control Channel or can it be also

776
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,680
client server control Channel and that's

777
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,119
one that we're going to have to look

778
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,920
into and also talk to other security

779
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,200
people to answer that question so I

780
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,640
guess it's very clear that we need a

781
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,619
work item on that because it's not just

782
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,180
a few words on the architecture which

783
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,339
will make that work yes

784
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,280
actually so I I

785
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,540
um that's actually a very very good

786
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,119
point Bob and the point here is also for

787
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,859
example coreconf it's working in a

788
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,680
client server way and typically is the

789
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,020
same thing uh so typically you can have

790
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,119
if you have a peer-to-peer relation you

791
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,339
can have both peers to have both the

792
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,740
server and the client uh so they can

793
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,240
have this like peering uh um yeah to be

794
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,060
like peer-to-peer yeah you got to play

795
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,940
games that both are are our servers for

796
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,820
this whereas I can hear that's implicit

797
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,060
in their design okay well probably maybe

798
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,520
we will we'll need to define the use

799
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,140
cases and see how things are moved

800
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,339
because maybe there will be several

801
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,980
solutions to that right so we'll need to

802
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,079
to really clear out how how things work

803
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,880
in the working group exactly and and

804
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,780
that's Anita Yeah so basically is there

805
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,180
an obvious no no to any of the elements

806
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,040
of this list

807
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,220
uh or you know anything you want to

808
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,680
mention because if we don't discuss more

809
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,540
basically the chairs will go with this

810
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,420
list and try to to write some Charter

811
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,300
so if you have any command to help us do

812
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,880
that or if you want us to take off some

813
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,280
some subjects or whatever before we

814
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,660
start drafting

815
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,060
any comment is welcome now and on the

816
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,078
mailing list obviously

817
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,540
yes

818
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,319
thank you

819
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,359
yes for the young mother I think it's

820
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,599
not only optimization but it's extension

821
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,640
to to the actual young model to to apply

822
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,040
it to different environment on different

823
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,020
management so it's more about

824
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,680
optimization

825
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,980
we'll ask you to

826
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,900
but we will try to to put all these

827
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,880
items in the in the in the recharging

828
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,099
proposal right

829
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,180
okay so I don't I don't see anyone

830
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,579
expressing negative feelings about any

831
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,800
of these points so this is what we're

832
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,660
going to do it's going to be so true

833
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,440
though

834
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,800
so yes thank you so thank you for for

835
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,900
the discussion uh and for living in

836
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,440
Pascal and uh Sergio is next and we are

837
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,760
almost on time that's good

838
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,280
if I say next

839
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,420
you say next slide yes your screen

840
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,940
doesn't work yes

841
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,579
so well hello I'm Sergio Aguilar from

842
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,160
UPC I'm going to present the

843
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,020
the update on the work that I've been

844
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,880
we've been working on on the check

845
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,280
convergence profile this is an update

846
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,540
from previous entry and meeting

847
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,660
presentation uh we did the individual

848
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,300
submission of the of the draft we added

849
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,300
motivation and use cases and well we

850
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,099
also had the the comparison between

851
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,740
Chicago one and Chicora sigfox opening

852
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,320
aquanero mode in this case uh the

853
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,300
comparison was already discussed in the

854
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,160
in the interim presentation but we added

855
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,540
to the to the draft next slide please

856
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,720
I go into that to the motivation uh well

857
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,180
we see that iot applications normally I

858
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,900
are tired to to the lp1 technology they

859
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,839
choose this lp1 lp1 technology

860
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,540
constraints are influence the design of

861
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,000
the iot application itself does

862
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,920
therefore when you try to migrate from

863
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,040
one lp1 technology to another uh you

864
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,960
probably need to redesign a complete

865
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,560
solution from a device code to to

866
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,280
backend code so from our point of view

867
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,339
the lp1 should be as an L2 layer should

868
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,380
be transparent to the application as it

869
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,460
is in the IAP domain next slide

870
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,380
uh what we see in currency

871
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,599
implementation we see that we have a

872
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,020
single uh compression the compression

873
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,359
sub layer but we see that we have

874
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,300
multiple cheek fragmentation uh

875
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,160
reassembly sub layers actually we have

876
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,400
one draft pair lp1 technology but once

877
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,859
you analyze the different modes there

878
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,720
are actually really similar fermentation

879
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,180
modes therefore we we think that to

880
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,400
reduce code complexity and maintenance

881
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,500
will be better to have a single

882
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,599
convergent cheek fragmentation and

883
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,320
reassembly Supply

884
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,119
uh here we see Korean architecture that

885
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,099
we have in this case we have multiple

886
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,720
implementation of the cheek fermentation

887
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,480
supplier it's better technology that

888
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,720
that is being used in in this case well

889
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,119
you can actually send chick fragments in

890
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,700
different lp1 Technologies uh but you

891
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,200
are not able well check packets I'm

892
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,079
sorry between different lp1 Technologies

893
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,420
but you need to have the different codes

894
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,820
to to be able to to manage them

895
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,079
in in the case we have a single cheek

896
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,300
fermentation

897
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,099
reassemblyism layer we will have we call

898
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,800
it Chic overall profile that in this

899
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,440
case will be the same regardless or of

900
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,560
of the lp1 technology in this case you

901
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,180
can actually receive cheek fragments

902
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,099
through different networks and actually

903
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:47,040
reassemble the packet at the at the

904
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,160
check reassembly layer

905
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,260
true

906
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,599
the use cases that we have identified

907
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,540
are for multi-radio devices devices that

908
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,240
Implement more than one lp1 radio

909
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,880
we also saw multi-network applications

910
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,859
in this case our applications that are

911
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,920
used over several uh LP or more than one

912
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,540
lp1 technology

913
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,820
uh from there we also see a use case

914
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,220
that this can be a generic fragmentation

915
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,260
reassembly profile if you want to test

916
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,440
it over a new technology like to have a

917
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,720
an out of the box fragmentation

918
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,540
reassembly mode

919
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,480
oh yeah we also see use cases in network

920
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,420
redundancy where you can use another lp1

921
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,079
Network as backup you can send the same

922
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,060
fragment or different cheek fragments

923
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,500
through different networks to increase

924
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,359
the probability of success for example

925
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,820
you can also increase the device to

926
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,460
recycle as the device has more networks

927
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,099
to send you can use another network

928
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:48,180
instead of the one that you are waiting

929
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,119
for the duty cycle time

930
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,980
and you can also check coverage of one

931
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,619
network sending messages in one network

932
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,599
receiving the app in other networks or

933
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,280
you're able to see if you have coverage

934
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,980
of of any lp1 network that that you have

935
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:08,579
uh here we we propose to to simplify the

936
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,980
access to the rules like this uh to

937
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,800
converge all the devices IDs into a

938
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,119
single chick ID

939
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,859
in this case

940
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,260
um we have different IDs each one from

941
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,079
lp1 different devices each from

942
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,780
different lp1 Technologies so the idea

943
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,119
is to have a single one once you have

944
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,520
this single ID you can go to the rules

945
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,579
to to see what are the rules of of that

946
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:36,300
of that device we we said that this can

947
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,700
be done through a table that actually

948
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,760
Maps the networks devices ID to the

949
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,220
chick ID and then we can go on and find

950
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,760
the rules this table can be actually

951
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,460
extended to have IP addresses IP ports

952
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,140
to identify the packets that are also

953
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,260
arriving from from the internet

954
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,820
approaches

955
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,220
uh in this case the the comparison that

956
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,260
we did about opening fragmentation we

957
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,579
actually evaluated that Chico where

958
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,560
Laura one draft with well a standard

959
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,119
with the chick over the sigfox option

960
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:06,960
two

961
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,599
both in these cases have two by check

962
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,480
fragment headers uh they have both the

963
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,960
same tile size of 10 byte and they use

964
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,560
um they use the no D tag in this case

965
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,560
and the differences are most related in

966
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,260
the window size and the amount of tiles

967
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,020
that you can carry in each window

968
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,280
foreign

969
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,640
therefore we see that that since there

970
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,920
is a lot of similarities uh we can

971
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,740
actually converge both profiles with a

972
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,460
rule ID of 8 Bits for example and in

973
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,099
this case we chose to have more windows

974
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:47,819
than more tiles per window since we can

975
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,099
have more opportunities to to actually

976
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:53,700
send the ACT to the device now with the

977
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,460
compound nag you can actually send and a

978
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,040
larger Arc if needed therefore you can

979
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,140
have for example if before you have a

980
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,240
larger window now you can have the same

981
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,920
amount of information in the in the

982
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,140
compound neck as as before

983
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,200
next

984
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,780
and finally well we for for this draft

985
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,000
we plan to to do a new open source

986
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,980
project in this case we call it

987
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,440
chigduino the idea is to implement chick

988
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,260
over for Arduino we think that this can

989
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,319
help actually the adoption of chick in a

990
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:28,200
larger extent uh with a single code code

991
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,300
base in this case this this convergent

992
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,300
profile you can only have to manage as a

993
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,880
one code and this can simplify

994
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,800
applications that want to migrate

995
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,780
between LP ones for multi-network

996
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,520
applications for example you have a

997
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,500
application already well you are

998
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,079
building the application for for an lp1

999
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,880
you're using cheek then you can migrate

1000
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,180
the application to another P1 uh let's

1001
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,040
say You by Chain not changing the

1002
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,440
application code but by changing the

1003
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,119
network connector at the end that is

1004
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,160
between the cheek and the network but

1005
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,339
you will have the same code this is this

1006
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,680
allows also fragments to be sent between

1007
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,480
multiple Networks

1008
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,760
and well in this case the proposition is

1009
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,099
to build the device code not exactly the

1010
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,260
server code and well one proposition is

1011
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,020
that maybe we can use opengica server to

1012
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:20,460
actually test uh also interoperability

1013
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,099
um yes so run sorry

1014
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,099
yes thank you for this initiative it's

1015
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:33,599
very interesting to to have different

1016
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,339
implementation of chic for

1017
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,599
interoperability

1018
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,240
but I was wondering more for very

1019
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,300
constrained devices if we need really to

1020
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,760
do compression decompress compression on

1021
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,640
the device and not manipulate directly

1022
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,160
the sheet rules which makes that the

1023
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,980
code will be lighter you just have to

1024
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,900
generate things for example Co-op can be

1025
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,720
done in in shoe line of code because you

1026
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,119
just send the residues and so this way

1027
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,700
you can have something very Compact and

1028
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,859
that's why for example we we aim to get

1029
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:11,220
the AUM because of course it's not not

1030
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,800
just sending information but also to

1031
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,619
make the device part of the internet and

1032
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,540
for example if you can receive icmp

1033
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,060
messages from the internet telling that

1034
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,000
your server is not available then the

1035
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,520
device can react and go sleeping longer

1036
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,680
just to preserve the battery because

1037
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,079
nobody is listening to his message so

1038
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,079
here we have a very nice scenario where

1039
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,359
we have very little code on on the

1040
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,119
device and we have a device that from

1041
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,720
outside has an IP address and react from

1042
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,140
internet informations

1043
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,680
Okay so

1044
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,020
thanks Lauren

1045
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,040
next slide I want to get you as well let

1046
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,960
me put myself on the

1047
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,460
flashlight well I will just ask a

1048
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,460
question yeah just to be frank and

1049
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,720
honest

1050
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,560
um

1051
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,780
the two foods that you have may not both

1052
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,180
survive in the long run

1053
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,819
on the other hand we are chartering for

1054
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:12,980
Chicago

1055
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,560
and Foo could be faster links

1056
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,420
like you know IP PPP whatever map links

1057
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,260
and so that's where I see the huge value

1058
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,579
of your work coming in and so do you

1059
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,700
consider looking at faster links and

1060
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,099
making proposal for a generic

1061
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:38,400
you know for first of all better food or

1062
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,300
whatever

1063
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,240
Yes actually the idea of having the out

1064
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,060
of the box uh cheek profile is to to

1065
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,500
enable that that kind of

1066
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,300
interoperability that you can actually

1067
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,420
test it over any kind of of network

1068
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,720
and this way you have like already a a

1069
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,579
profile that has been tested actually

1070
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:58,800
that we've been working on it uh since a

1071
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,780
while both Laura one and six folks now

1072
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,060
that the conversion of both it's already

1073
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,579
been tested in a sense so yeah I think

1074
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,880
that this this profile can help actually

1075
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,040
um help over other other radio

1076
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,440
Technologies yes you should explain how

1077
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,020
to tune some parameters based on

1078
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,420
whatever differs with this technology

1079
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,880
right like the speed if the yeah there

1080
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
is faster what should you do if your MTU

1081
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,380
is a lot bigger what should you do there

1082
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,720
has to be an adaptation in in between

1083
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,200
the fragmentation layer and the actual

1084
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,660
Network that's been sent I added a

1085
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,859
section in the draft that is called

1086
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,900
downlink considerations that that's

1087
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,460
where I see that we have to take that

1088
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,200
the actual considerations of each

1089
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,420
technology for example is different to

1090
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,040
send uh well it's really similar in

1091
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,480
order one and six folks let's say you

1092
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,980
have to send first the message to

1093
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,920
receive a down link but maybe in other

1094
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,660
technology you can receive the downlink

1095
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,540
directly so this sense there is specific

1096
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,420
things of each technology but I think

1097
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,520
that these drafts can help use the same

1098
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,880
fragmentation but with singularities per

1099
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,460
technology if we are successful with

1100
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,960
many foods we can't have as many

1101
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,960
implementations right yes

1102
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,079
Bob are there some aggressive examples

1103
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,980
of those full Technologies consider

1104
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,700
802.16

1105
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,980
h.11ah but long range and high

1106
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,680
capacity usage so the frames are not so

1107
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,940
small

1108
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,280
but there's just potentially so much

1109
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,000
traffic that the the the driver for Chic

1110
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,599
is to reduce collisions because of the

1111
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,960
the capacity usage so that would be the

1112
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,560
example of the uh of the the foo use

1113
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,119
case

1114
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,040
um for for that consideration in fact

1115
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,619
that's exactly what I'm working on

1116
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:55,920
I I will I would like to add that um

1117
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,160
uh we I started with opling aquanerver

1118
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,500
mode but we can do the same for no no

1119
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,839
whack and have a single profile for

1120
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,540
Nowak and the same for like always in

1121
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,339
well it's more using down link but we

1122
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,859
can have a the three different modes

1123
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:13,400
also

1124
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:17,700
um just um a a short comment so I like

1125
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,740
very much your work

1126
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,240
um actually in the beginning of the

1127
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,160
working group we were asking ourselves

1128
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,380
can we have some what we were calling

1129
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,839
that a minimal profile at the time I

1130
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,880
think uh where we were saying can we

1131
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,040
have like the same minimal rules that

1132
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,200
can be the same in moral and sick fast

1133
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,839
just to at least have like a very basic

1134
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:39,000
stuff and and maybe have more advanced

1135
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,300
in each draft and at that time I think

1136
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,880
that we were not I mean we didn't know

1137
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,040
how things will go so both Technologies

1138
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,800
said no we don't want that

1139
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,599
um and uh right now you're saying okay

1140
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,220
maybe we can find some middle ground

1141
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,680
right so I find that interesting I found

1142
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,480
also what uh Pascal is saying very

1143
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,520
interesting is to say okay how would

1144
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,940
this work enter in this bigger framework

1145
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,780
of chic over food where you can maybe

1146
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,300
have at some point this minimal Prof I

1147
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,800
I'm calling it the minimal profile if

1148
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,420
you want to carry the convergence

1149
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,460
profile like to say okay well

1150
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,660
I have this uh uh a set of of rules

1151
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,240
which are like Universal and I can at

1152
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,920
least bootstrap my communication over

1153
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,920
that right so I feel that your work gets

1154
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,800
in the in that in that direction right

1155
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,720
uh the points I'm I'm not sure is how

1156
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,280
it's going to be working because there

1157
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,200
is already the Laura one profile out

1158
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,000
there there is going to be the the sick

1159
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,040
Fox profile and if I understand

1160
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,480
correctly there are diff they're a

1161
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,980
little bit different from the things you

1162
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,359
are proposing

1163
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,040
here I mean it's normal that they're

1164
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,500
different so I'll need I mean we'll need

1165
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,640
to figure out

1166
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,619
so today you have like a lower one

1167
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,420
device and you will know

1168
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,819
the shake profile to that device just

1169
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,079
because it's lower one and you know okay

1170
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,079
it's RFC 19911 right

1171
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,819
so then we'll need to distinguish maybe

1172
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:03,059
okay there is the RFC 9011 and there is

1173
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:05,640
maybe this convergence profile so there

1174
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,359
is this thing of how would that work

1175
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:11,760
and and how you apply your work to to

1176
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,339
the Chic over Foo right so I think maybe

1177
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,020
during the rechargering we'll need you

1178
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,540
will need to look at your draft through

1179
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,520
that angle right okay how does it enter

1180
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,819
in the new Charter items and to see what

1181
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,940
will be the require I mean does it fit

1182
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,680
there what what's the requirement on

1183
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,720
that convergence profile there

1184
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,359
so I'm I don't have an answer to that I

1185
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,520
find your work super interesting and I

1186
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
think that there is a big potential in

1187
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,000
that in that aspect right but we will

1188
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,720
need to to look exactly you know how how

1189
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,800
will

1190
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,140
how it will evolve from there okay very

1191
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,980
interesting yes

1192
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,700
do you plan or thought to handle

1193
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,579
mobility in this scenario or it's only a

1194
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:03,240
fix since since we can send fragments

1195
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,940
through any network uh yes I think that

1196
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,780
Mobility is a total option yes but more

1197
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,579
for example if you go from a satellite

1198
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,440
Network and you arrive to a new area

1199
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,319
where you have a lower coverage so it's

1200
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,839
more in the way you manage the identity

1201
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,359
in your in your system

1202
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,460
yet since uh

1203
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,160
well

1204
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,720
that's uh where I have seen it like the

1205
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,819
implementation how the single point

1206
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:32,819
where all the let's say the the posts

1207
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:34,680
from all networks Lord I want let's say

1208
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,359
Seek Fox satellite are coming to your

1209
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:39,300
server uh you have to have a device ID

1210
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,880
there that with a single device ID you

1211
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,700
are able to come to know which rules you

1212
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,859
go and then you will be able to let's

1213
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,900
say identify that packet at that session

1214
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,079
the instance of that packet or that

1215
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,119
fragment I will say so you will be able

1216
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:56,880
to to complete the the packet the cheap

1217
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,859
packet I don't know if I made myself

1218
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:01,200
clear so yeah the idea actually is that

1219
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,420
you can send a fragment through any

1220
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,819
network so if you are heading to a place

1221
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:07,500
that now you have coverage of another

1222
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,480
Network you can just change and continue

1223
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,400
sending the same fragments to this other

1224
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,920
network that's like the objective also

1225
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,059
here okay thank you

1226
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,300
foreign

1227
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,520
just one question on what you said

1228
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,440
probably

1229
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,780
a more interesting or applicable thing

1230
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,640
would be if you have both Technologies

1231
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,319
and two technologies or some kind of

1232
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,420
network coding so you can send the same

1233
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,839
fragment on two networks Technologies

1234
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,339
and you know because you're having the

1235
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:46,140
same parameters you don't care which one

1236
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,180
goes through right

1237
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,740
but I think we need to look at your

1238
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,780
draft as well from the point of view of

1239
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,180
this session establishment

1240
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,559
thing

1241
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:59,339
right so yes it's good thing about 401

1242
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:00,839
it's good thing about sick Fox let's

1243
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,180
keep that in mind but also let's look at

1244
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,640
through the glass itself okay I have

1245
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,260
this session establishment what do I

1246
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,359
need to have in this convergence profile

1247
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,520
perfect thank you very much

1248
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,640
thank you yes so maybe we can give the

1249
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,680
word to Dominic to have a two or two

1250
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,720
minutes about the the hackathon and then

1251
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,140
uh

1252
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,839
foreign

1253
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,260
it should be very fast let me just check

1254
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,960
so we'll have just a minute uh a couple

1255
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,640
of minutes to

1256
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,260
how you can share your screen oh yeah

1257
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,180
okay I mean you can

1258
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,119
oh no it is approved anyways I put them

1259
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,680
in there okay

1260
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,260
okay if you want to share

1261
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,040
and there you go

1262
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,180
that's the new

1263
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,160
otherwise it will be available in a

1264
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,279
second

1265
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,859
okay so the screen share so yes it's

1266
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:14,359
coming up yes yes here you can see our

1267
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:17,579
smiling faces from the hackathon and

1268
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,520
Saturday and Sunday the names are listed

1269
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,920
uh Martin is not on the picture she was

1270
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,520
at the other tablet right at that time

1271
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,020
um so what we did is uh Yvonne and Lohan

1272
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,559
worked mostly then worked on cleaning up

1273
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,680
the open cheek GitHub repo emerging

1274
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,160
branches cleaning up Etc we had the

1275
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,800
Contour over there developing a clean

1276
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,859
slate implementation using micro passion

1277
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,079
if you remember we originally said we

1278
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,940
would use micro python for embedded

1279
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,940
devices and then diverge to full python

1280
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,220
so now we have another new

1281
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,520
implementation in micro python I worked

1282
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,720
on the documentation

1283
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,059
we had Sergio working on the designing

1284
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,680
the connector between open check and

1285
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,500
sick Fox network sir and we did

1286
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,059
interrupt testing with Martin and the

1287
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,859
riot

1288
00:57:15,859 --> 00:57:18,900
gang and so we were successful in

1289
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,020
exchanging a few compressed packets in

1290
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,000
both directions

1291
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,839
UDP IPv6 compressed between open check

1292
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,500
on one side and right slip check on the

1293
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,339
other side so not everything works

1294
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:37,800
Etc but that's a good start and we also

1295
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,380
exchanged now we worked on but did not

1296
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,579
complete that but working on the

1297
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:46,559
interrupt between the micro sheet and

1298
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,780
the open check implementations

1299
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,619
and

1300
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:55,800
yeah what what we learned is uh from the

1301
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,720
Clinton implementation content came up

1302
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,540
with lots of good questions

1303
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,280
uh you know the way we describe things

1304
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,460
in the RC the design entrances we've

1305
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,000
made in the past and we could reconsider

1306
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,099
implementation recommendations Etc other

1307
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:13,200
ways of doing the same thing with the

1308
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,300
same toolbox but organized in a bit

1309
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,440
different way and that's what content

1310
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,900
published his ideas in a draft yesterday

1311
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,540
night we don't we're not on the agenda

1312
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,640
to discuss that today but let me come up

1313
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,099
in an intro meeting in the future thank

1314
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:31,280
you

1315
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,960
thank you very much Dominic and and we'd

1316
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,420
like also to to to to underline that

1317
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,160
it's really amazing all the work that

1318
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,260
everyone is doing at the hackathon so

1319
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,540
there has been a hackathon on Chic for

1320
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,339
since I don't know how many years I

1321
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,720
think for

1322
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,480
Five Years on every hackathon and and

1323
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
that's really an amazing thing to have

1324
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,140
like the running code and right now we

1325
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,940
see all these implementations coming so

1326
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,220
it's really an amazing work so we'd like

1327
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,140
to really really thank the all

1328
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,579
participants in the hackathon it's

1329
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,740
really amazing and thank you for for

1330
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,079
organizing it and with with Laurent for

1331
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,440
taking care of that so it's really great

1332
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,380
so we we actually consciously let this

1333
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,200
discussion uh fly a little bit longer

1334
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,200
than uh initially in the agenda because

1335
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,880
we thought that the discussion on the

1336
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,799
convergence was really really good and

1337
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:21,480
and constructive

1338
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,780
uh we still have half an hour on the

1339
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,520
architecture proposal it doesn't work no

1340
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,900
also right

1341
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,720
and uh so there we go it's a bit less

1342
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,900
than we thought but you have one alpha

1343
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,880
or two

1344
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,520
okay so I I don't know I don't think I

1345
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,440
will have Alpha network but we we can

1346
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,780
have discussion on that because also I

1347
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,140
will summarize what we say yesterday in

1348
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,119
a side meeting like

1349
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,700
if you want

1350
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,339
in the same we think about Sheikh and

1351
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,500
what has been done and all the good

1352
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,440
question you are we were we got when we

1353
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,420
published The Young data model and

1354
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,220
specially about security

1355
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,740
so we have to merge all these things

1356
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,200
into the architecture document

1357
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,020
so I just remind you here what is the

1358
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,559
current architecture what we are uh go

1359
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:16,260
where we are going with Chic so we have

1360
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,079
in in red here the young data model that

1361
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:22,200
are developed right now and these two

1362
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,799
young data model are just following what

1363
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:29,220
is defined in the two rfcs that Define

1364
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,460
rules and identifier for Chic so RFC

1365
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:38,160
8724 and a RFC 8824 so IPv6 UDP and and

1366
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,980
Co-op and can you go back to I thought

1367
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,240
you were

1368
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,940
um on this one and of course we can also

1369
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,760
we are now planning to extend augment

1370
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,440
this model for aom and Company so here

1371
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,220
it's in red it's the Intel part so it

1372
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,819
means that different uh Chic element can

1373
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,520
exchange this information and from that

1374
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,760
you have your local representation of

1375
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,819
the Chic rules but are optimized for

1376
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:10,260
your environment

1377
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,900
so here we

1378
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,940
let people to implement Chic as they

1379
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,980
want we just focus on the

1380
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,799
interoperability and this Enterprise if

1381
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:22,619
we go to some constraint Network should

1382
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,859
use kokov because here we have a compact

1383
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:28,619
way to represent the information we we

1384
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,119
want to exchange

1385
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,420
so from that we add good question when

1386
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,359
we about the young modern security so we

1387
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,700
had good question during the

1388
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,940
the review of the document so next

1389
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,400
slides please and one other question was

1390
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,059
how to protect element of the rule to

1391
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:51,240
avoid that someone can modify some some

1392
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,119
element in the root Rule and it's not uh

1393
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:56,579
it was not allowed to do that

1394
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,160
so the first reflection we we had is

1395
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,880
that

1396
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,460
in our views and maybe we are wrong we

1397
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,880
have we are not full Specialists of of

1398
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,180
young is that currently you have some

1399
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:12,000
protections that are given in young to

1400
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,160
access to a specific field

1401
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,500
so here for example we have an abstract

1402
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,700
representation of the of the rule so

1403
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,140
each field

1404
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,980
will have a specific ID in young which

1405
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,859
will be on URL or if we are going to go

1406
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:30,780
conf it will be a number

1407
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,839
so all these ID will have the same all

1408
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,720
these columns we have the same ID which

1409
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,540
has some ID or the same number

1410
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:42,780
and so what we can do right now in

1411
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,480
protecting even in writing in a model

1412
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,359
that we can say that a column is right

1413
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:53,339
only or read and write or with the

1414
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:57,000
viewer model I think it's cacm we can

1415
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,059
add to this list some property and say

1416
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:03,119
this guy can modify this line and this

1417
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,920
guy is not a lot

1418
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,799
but when we look at what we want to do

1419
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:10,380
with Chic it's with something more

1420
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,200
precise because for example we can have

1421
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,440
a can imagine an attack where someone

1422
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:21,000
take control of the device and send a

1423
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,400
management request to the core and say

1424
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,619
change this parameter for example change

1425
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,260
my destination address because this way

1426
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,500
I will do a DDOS on the specific site

1427
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,680
so here maybe or maybe not it depends of

1428
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,200
the context we can allow the device to

1429
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,480
change the destination address

1430
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,380
same thing the device can change its own

1431
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,660
address and maybe take the address on

1432
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,900
another element so we have to to protect

1433
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,900
that and to do this protection is not

1434
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,500
something that is in columns but we need

1435
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,599
to have access to one field and say for

1436
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,180
example if we want to change the source

1437
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,339
address right it means that we need that

1438
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:06,780
the id1 is Source address and this

1439
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,200
element is only write only on cannot be

1440
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,900
modified by the device so it means that

1441
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,799
here we have to get an effort to improve

1442
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,299
augment

1443
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:21,540
the access control that we have already

1444
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,599
in young maybe we are wrong but if the

1445
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:27,299
case then you can contact us to to say

1446
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:30,299
so that's the first point so the next

1447
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,059
Point next slide please so here is

1448
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:36,900
resume what I say so first thing is that

1449
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,619
we but we saw that it's not enough we

1450
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,960
have to say that a device can only

1451
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,359
manipulate its own information

1452
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,880
and cannot change the information of

1453
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,480
other devices in a car so this can be

1454
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,839
done for example with it must be

1455
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:58,619
explicit in what we wrote it means that

1456
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:01,260
we don't have to send IDs on the link

1457
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,319
but if a device sends something it's for

1458
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,200
its own representation and not for the

1459
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,400
rest of the model

1460
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,680
and then we have the thing I say about

1461
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,940
the protection of fields specific fields

1462
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:17,099
and not columns

1463
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:18,500
yep

1464
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,079
so um so just just one one point here

1465
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,240
and I think that's that was a very

1466
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,059
interesting um let's say Discovery uh

1467
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:29,520
the point here is that we can have the

1468
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,680
we want to have basically the same level

1469
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,380
of security as if the device is running

1470
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,680
the full IP stack natively so if someone

1471
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,720
goes and compromises the device this is

1472
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,000
the only thing that gets compromised so

1473
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,280
that that's that's the idea right and

1474
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,079
the point is that so what lahoe is

1475
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,760
saying is right now we are talking about

1476
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,760
uh having more dynamicity you know

1477
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,500
having the session setup updating the

1478
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,420
rules and all that which is really

1479
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,940
necessary for to get the full power of

1480
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,559
the of the shake technology

1481
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:00,599
but the point is that if the device gets

1482
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:03,780
compromised you could imagine that the

1483
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,619
device can push some rules to the uh to

1484
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:09,720
the core Network to the application and

1485
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,240
these rules can actually match for

1486
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,240
example any packet that's coming from

1487
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,640
the internet so you can it can divert

1488
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,280
let's say all the the information that

1489
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,020
could come to the core Network and it

1490
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,000
can get all that information by just

1491
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,520
modifying its own rules

1492
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,980
right and then that that's a problem so

1493
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,539
that's something that we don't want to

1494
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:33,119
to to allow and this is something that

1495
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,740
we'll need to describe like the the

1496
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,559
types of threads that uh uh that can

1497
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:40,140
that can arise so we need to Define that

1498
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:45,299
and we need to add this uh um uh we need

1499
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:46,799
to add the mechanisms to be able to con

1500
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,319
to to to counter this type of attacks

1501
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,839
right so that's what uh what what's

1502
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,140
really important here and uh uh uh in I

1503
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,359
mean went in in a lot of details right

1504
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,579
but it was really a uh an important

1505
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:01,500
point to say we need to to to work on

1506
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,799
this one

1507
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,099
right so yes that is uh something that

1508
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:11,640
we started discussing at this uh little

1509
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,559
meeting

1510
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:17,460
the bottom line is we have isolated we

1511
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:20,099
have understood clarified that Sheikh

1512
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:22,079
operates between two devices and there

1513
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,520
is a form of session that happens

1514
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,859
between those two devices

1515
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:28,740
and during this discussion let's in my

1516
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,140
view appeared is that

1517
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,559
you need to identify the session before

1518
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,020
you start applying the rules because

1519
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,640
that's the session which will tell you

1520
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,680
which rules there are if you do it in

1521
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,200
the wrong order a new match based on

1522
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,420
some rules you have and then you think

1523
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,460
oh that must be the session then you

1524
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,339
might have this sort of attack coming in

1525
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:52,619
if you identify the session say for five

1526
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:55,260
Topo which basically says this Source

1527
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,020
this destination packet coming from the

1528
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,680
internet to the compressor

1529
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,020
will match this session

1530
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,299
then only packets to that destination

1531
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:08,640
which match these are called is this

1532
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,020
filter will be passed through

1533
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,960
the the rules meaning that there is no

1534
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,479
way through check to intercept the whole

1535
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,660
internet to your point okay so so we the

1536
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,359
architecture is missing text

1537
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:27,060
on how you identify the session we are

1538
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,738
kind of clear for the most peace when

1539
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:30,600
the packet arrives in the compressed

1540
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,620
form

1541
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,198
but when the packets arrives from the

1542
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:36,719
internet to the compressor we need to be

1543
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,580
very specific that first you must

1544
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,620
isolate the session say from the five

1545
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,140
Topo and what can whatever filter

1546
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,939
and then once you have isolated the

1547
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:46,500
session then you're within the small

1548
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,660
world of the target device that's when

1549
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,738
you look at these rules

1550
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:54,238
okay yes so something that is very

1551
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,399
important because for the moment if we

1552
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,020
don't do that for example we can use the

1553
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,540
floor label as a way to select different

1554
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:03,420
devices that will share the same IPv6

1555
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,719
address and we don't want that we want

1556
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,420
to keep what is used on on the internet

1557
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,738
so

1558
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:13,500
we don't want to to add new feature but

1559
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,620
very be very close to the IP model

1560
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,799
so the the other element is but it's

1561
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:22,259
more something that has to describe in

1562
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:24,299
the architecture architecture document

1563
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:27,439
is how we install risk management

1564
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:32,160
between two devices so ever to get all

1565
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,339
the rules to modify partially in a rule

1566
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,979
on in both the buff directions so we

1567
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,479
have different scenario for example a

1568
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,179
device arrive and ask for its rules or

1569
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,160
ask for certain parameters on the rule

1570
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,339
or push the rule in the core and set up

1571
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:50,100
some parameters in in the core so we

1572
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,920
have all the these things so how we do

1573
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,100
that so it can be of course as I say in

1574
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,300
the constraint where you have a

1575
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,179
constraint link it can be a core conf so

1576
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:03,420
it means that we have uh c bar and and

1577
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:08,280
Co-op so how we run these instances

1578
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,640
do we have to encrypt or to have a

1579
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,140
security layer

1580
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,020
all the time so that's another question

1581
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,080
for example if you use a Laura one maybe

1582
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,940
it's you know the cryptography called

1583
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,300
things offered by Lauren are enough

1584
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,699
and then since we are using

1585
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:28,380
a score

1586
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,260
um sorry Co-op or score tdtls and all

1587
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,219
that stuff

1588
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,340
of course since we are compression guy

1589
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,440
then we can also Define compression

1590
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,440
rules for this management and we have to

1591
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,140
specify it to have something uh very

1592
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,719
compact

1593
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:47,760
next point please

1594
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,060
so here is the last one so it's start

1595
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:54,800
from a discussion with uh what colors

1596
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,900
pushing some interim meetings and we add

1597
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,760
a lot of the description on that and now

1598
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,699
I think the model is a little bit more

1599
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:06,659
clear and Sergio add or maybe new

1600
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:12,120
arrowsing in in this but in fact when we

1601
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,460
we are based at the beginning of the

1602
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,820
group on lp1 architecture it means that

1603
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,040
we have a start apology on this was

1604
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,159
quite easy to to manipulate because we

1605
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,719
have a central point that was the core

1606
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,440
of the application and talk with a lot

1607
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,580
of devices so what we need to identify

1608
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:34,260
was only the devices

1609
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,620
but if we move to something more generic

1610
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,040
so like a mesh Network then you can have

1611
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:41,840
the

1612
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,940
hosts that talk to other hosts using

1613
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:48,300
Chic and it means that we have two

1614
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,300
two new things the thing is that you can

1615
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,580
have several core

1616
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,980
but we have also some dependency and we

1617
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,800
have a kind of circle dependency as it

1618
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,060
is shown on this uh graphic because for

1619
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,400
example if you say a is a device and B

1620
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,860
is a core then C will have problem

1621
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,219
because c will be act as a device or a

1622
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:14,520
core for the other one so we cannot say

1623
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,580
in a mesh Network that some elements are

1624
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,580
core on some elements are devices but it

1625
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:23,159
depends really of the the context or

1626
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:25,679
what you you call the the session of

1627
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:31,159
instance so here we represent that in

1628
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:34,080
this schema so you you have of course

1629
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,840
this circle this dependencies but we

1630
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,900
have also some elements that can be both

1631
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,140
core and device at the same time

1632
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,159
regarding the rule so the only

1633
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,380
constraint we we haven't has been

1634
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,580
published in events drafts is that we

1635
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,159
need to if we have this case with the

1636
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:55,800
two red arrows then we cannot share the

1637
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,060
same rule ID on both sessions

1638
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,239
so now but it's a little bit more clear

1639
01:13:03,239 --> 01:13:05,940
for for us so we have to implement that

1640
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,360
in the architecture document and Define

1641
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,600
this notion of session or instance that

1642
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,719
will ever be static it means that it

1643
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:18,659
depends only on information on the rules

1644
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:21,480
or can be dynamic and then we will have

1645
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,400
to develop a protocol for our

1646
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:30,179
tier a tie breaker to find with with the

1647
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:32,940
device with the core with some problem

1648
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:34,679
is that for example if you look at the

1649
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:35,699
MAC address

1650
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:39,480
for some time not be something enough

1651
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,480
because you need to have a server or

1652
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,239
client and the role doesn't depend on

1653
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,280
the Mac address so here we have to be

1654
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,219
very very careful for doing that and we

1655
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:52,440
have to to look at solution in the

1656
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,000
architecture document

1657
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,940
so the exact language in the

1658
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,060
architecture document at this point is

1659
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,960
that shake defines a session so that's

1660
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,120
the lowercase session it's just a word

1661
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,739
meaning that there is this relationship

1662
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:09,480
between two nodes

1663
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,699
and we give it a name we call it the

1664
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:13,679
Chic instance that's why you see

1665
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:17,280
instances in that slide so that's the

1666
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,320
name we give to to that session between

1667
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:23,100
a device and an application and we say

1668
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,960
that there are a number of cases that we

1669
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,600
list where the session identification is

1670
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,120
implicit and the parameters are implicit

1671
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,719
as well and know how and six blocks no

1672
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,580
it's clearly the case there is no

1673
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,980
session negotiation there is never a

1674
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,320
need to say which session between you

1675
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,679
and me there is only one uh and uh which

1676
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,360
is the role there is anyone set Etc

1677
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,699
everything is pre-programmed coded so

1678
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:49,800
there is no negotiation at all and no

1679
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,960
social notification apart from you know

1680
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,640
the Gateway looks at which Laura device

1681
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,080
it comes from or something and that

1682
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,600
gives him a session

1683
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,940
um for a Bluetooth low energy where you

1684
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:02,520
have a central node and peripheral node

1685
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,040
then same thing I mean the central node

1686
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,739
is the server and and that's it so there

1687
01:15:07,739 --> 01:15:09,239
are a lot of cases like this why it's

1688
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:12,179
implicit when we start a transport like

1689
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:15,540
a PPP connection we also say hey the guy

1690
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,460
who starts the PPP connection is the

1691
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,219
device so it's also implicit the other

1692
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:21,960
things which might not be implicit that

1693
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,060
the need for this header but at least

1694
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,860
the architecture say there are cases why

1695
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,120
it's implicit and here is what it's

1696
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,679
going to be and then there are cases

1697
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:30,420
like the mesh where it cannot be

1698
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,280
implicit there are tons of reasons why

1699
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,560
it could be either one and from multiple

1700
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,840
instances it could be not the same like

1701
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,239
represented in red here in this case

1702
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:41,340
effectively there is a need of a secure

1703
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,920
negotiation protocol to make sure both

1704
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,520
parties agree on what is what and we in

1705
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,080
the architecture we don't go further

1706
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,179
than that we don't say what that

1707
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,800
negotiation could be or anything we

1708
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,719
leave it to the further work at the

1709
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,940
reach out after reach out there if we

1710
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:58,980
reach out there for that and and I will

1711
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:01,260
also add that the work done as a six

1712
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:04,739
load to see how we can put 6 low and

1713
01:16:04,739 --> 01:16:07,440
seek together will be a very variable

1714
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,059
input for for this document

1715
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,679
any question before

1716
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:19,560
I guess we release everybody a little

1717
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,199
bit earlier any aob discussion any

1718
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:23,940
discussion on this

1719
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:27,799
uh on last presentation

1720
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,760
well that's good for the trains for

1721
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,080
those who are waiting for the trends

1722
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,580
then and I know a few of them which will

1723
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,659
scramble

1724
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:39,960
so we thank you for staying uh to the

1725
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,659
last minute uh at this ATF

1726
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:46,140
and we'll organize very soon the next

1727
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,300
round of intro meeting we start

1728
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:51,060
producing text on the recharge ring

1729
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:52,980
we'll see what we can write right away

1730
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,440
on the architecture not match but

1731
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,480
because we need those those work items

1732
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,040
to progress before the architecture can

1733
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,100
reflect the work of decisions but

1734
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,739
um yes let's let's move on and you'll

1735
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:06,179
see probably in three weeks or four

1736
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:07,920
weeks an interim

1737
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,679
harness yes and we would like to thank

1738
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:12,480
the the scribes and for everyone that

1739
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,780
has taken minutes for all the fruitful

1740
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,780
discussions and uh for you being here

1741
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:22,679
and uh hopefully we'll see you in a

1742
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,840
couple of week of months again at the

1743
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,880
next ITF and in the meantime we'll have

1744
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,480
interims so see you in the interims and

1745
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,179
uh thank you again

1746
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:36,860
and the meeting isn't drawn

1747
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,980
oh if you wish

1748
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,459
foreign

1749
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,699
to the London Bridge train station we

1750
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:50,780
can always share a taxi

1751
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,219
foreign
