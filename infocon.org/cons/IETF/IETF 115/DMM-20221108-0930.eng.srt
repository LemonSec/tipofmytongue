okay we should get started

12
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,660
hello welcome to the DMM working group

13
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,920
I'm just regular Valley

14
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,319
Okay so

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,480
this is the agenda for today first thing

16
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,280
please be familiar with the IPR

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,440
statement

18
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,680
and the next one is the note 12 we all

19
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
are familiar with the note 12. Please be

20
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,879
aware of

21
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,580
please read the note 12 statement this

22
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,400
document is this meeting is governed

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,500
under certain rules please be familiar

24
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,440
with the with these suits

25
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,459
and before we don't need the blue sheets

26
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,819
anymore yeah uh we want the note taker

27
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,738
please any volunteers

28
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,940

foreign

30
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,298
thank you so much

31
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,060
okay quick uh update on the document

32
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,420
status

33
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,990
[Music]

34
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,800
so the first one uh the working these

35
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,419
are the working group documents first

36
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,160
one is segment routing for Segment

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,639
routing or IPv6 for mobile user plane

38
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,520
this has finished the the working group

39
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,840
last call

40
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,360
it's with the area director

41
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,699
they can ask for status later and next

42
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,740
one is the mobility

43
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,740
slicing for 5G we have a presentation

44
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,259
coming out from John and team

45
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,600
next one is user playing protocol

46
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,479
analysis or visual 5G system not much

47
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,979
update on this but uh

48
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,780
so

49
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,620
first thing I think we can start with

50
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
John's presentation this is the mobility

51
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,000
of a transport Network slicing for 5G

52
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,919
thank you

53
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,919
this is

54
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,620
so thanks um this is the uh a fifth

55
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,720
revision of the mobile a little bit

56
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,720
closer job closer yeah okay I thought I

57
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,560
was there was too much echo or maybe not

58
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,500
is that is okay

59
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,780
so this is the fifth revision we've made

60
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,639
of the working group draft the mobile

61
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,000
aware uh transport Network slicing

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,180
let me see if the clicker works or does

63
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,960
not work okay

64
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,380
so if we go to the next slide please

65
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,639
um

66
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,020
so uh We've the document is generally

67
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,080
very stable we've we're really working

68
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,100
with

69
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,280
um addressing the comments and uh you

70
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,080
know basically all the comments that

71
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,940
we've received in the last meeting

72
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,860
so I'll just go through this I've

73
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,259
divided into four sections really the

74
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,780
major comments were really to align the

75
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,380
terminology and the concepts uh to the

76
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,780
t's Network slices work

77
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,080
and we've done a lot of work to align

78
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,280
with the t's framework using the

79
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
terminology the concepts and even

80
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,979
working with the folks in who are who

81
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,400
are around that the framework draft

82
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,440
um so I'll get into that on the next few

83
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,259
pages the the other one was uh to

84
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,360
address a relation to the 3gpp functions

85
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,860
and we've clarified that we're we're not

86
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,199
modifying or changing any of the 3gpp

87
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,780
functions we're only relating it to how

88
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,780
the user plane is or the transport

89
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,180
network is setting up the slices

90
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,180
and uh I guess the third one was a broad

91
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,300
comment to read to have the text in the

92
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,319
draft read more consistently and uh to

93
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,180
that extent I think we've we've made

94
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,340
significant we'll go and go through it

95
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,900
and you know

96
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,819
we made it made changes throughout the

97
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,620
draft actually on that

98
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,319
so let me go to the next page please

99
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,419
um so this is just a reference to the

100
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,759
abstract section to show that you know

101
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,400
we are addressing the comments that were

102
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,919
received so fundamentally the changes in

103
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,039
T's terminology we've changed uh the

104
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,260
terminology to use

105
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,039
uh customer so the 3gpp customer to an

106
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,099
ietf slice provider with an intermediate

107
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,979
Network in between which is the specific

108
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,140
use case that we're addressing

109
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,140
so that's that's updated in the abstract

110
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,779
but also in the rest of the document to

111
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,220
cover the whole thing

112
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,380
the rest of details I think you know

113
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,820
you'll have to read the draft but I'll

114
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,620
be able to clarify questions on this or

115
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,019
anywhere else so if we go to the next

116
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,260
page

117
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,700
right on this one again it's again the

118
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,320
major comment that we're addressing is

119
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,880
the teas terminology

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,180
so there was not that much to change per

121
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,980
se in the figure itself

122
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,040
um basically we were using an sdn

123
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,580
controller sdnc and the TS terminology

124
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,540
refers to it as a network controller I

125
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,940
think um there is a one-to-one

126
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,339
correspondence but the specific uses of

127
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,580
network controller and then the the

128
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,800
others that we had refer to it as a

129
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
transport Network function in the 5G

130
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,839
management plane but what T is generally

131
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,880
refers to is an orchestrator and we've

132
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,959
called it the transport Network

133
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,640
Orchestra here

134
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,700
so so I think it's pretty well aligned

135
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,080
now

136
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,760
um in terms of the terminology and the

137
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,620
text so if we go to the next page please

138
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,080
right so here I think we're getting into

139
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,500
the specifics of the draft and uh you

140
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
know what we are covering in the draft

141
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,519
is that this is a scenario where there

142
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,820
is an attachment circuit in between the

143
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,300
3gpp customer which is the requester of

144
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,420
the slice and the provider which is the

145
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,640
transport

146
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,820
ietf transport provider and you know we

147
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,459
also go into the service demarcation

148
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,380
points I mean where where those are and

149
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,080
um so if we go to the next sorry uh I'm

150
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,240
going to the next politics

151
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,959
um

152
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,980
again we clarify the tno being a logical

153
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,380
entity that can be a part of the nssf

154
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,440
but we don't get into describing what it

155
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,700
is that is

156
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,000
you know in 3gpp and then we also

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,620
clarified how the

158
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,920
UDP Port information is provided from

159
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,779
the slice establishment to the

160
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,360
management plane because that was the

161
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,899
part that we need to address in terms of

162
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,060
um how the how they how it's populated

163
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,640
to how the user plane works I mean which

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,560
is what we're describing this draft

165
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,440
yeah I think it you know the the changes

166
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,640
were

167
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,399
um in terms of really terminology and um

168
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,980
and the concepts and teas and also the

169
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,399
3gpp related aspects to how it works I

170
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,740
believe that now the we've addressed

171
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,720
each of those comments and also made a

172
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,060
thorough change in the draft to make it

173
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,120
read consistently it's also aligned with

174
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,640
I mean so tease is actually working on

175
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,019
some other

176
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,500
um uses of the slice and this becomes

177
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,899
it's fully aligned with that this is one

178
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,560
of the cases where the the the service

179
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,959
demarcation point and the customer

180
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
requesting it are separate and so it is

181
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,120
it they have other cases which they use

182
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,360
Layer Two and other things so this

183
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,180
becomes one of the many ways in which

184
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,700
you can configure slices and

185
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,459
I think it is ready uh to progress but

186
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,940
we need reviews from the group

187
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,800
um and we'd be happy to

188
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,000
you know address comments as they come

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,860
so I I'd really like to request for

190
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,640
reviews and see how we can proceed

191
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,880
thank you John any questions comments

192
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,180
yeah please yeah uh attention from uh

193
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,079
cmsac I have a I have an address through

194
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,680
the whole details of the draft but I

195
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,200
just wondering because yesterday I was

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,779
thinking one thing from the uh the five

197
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,260
uh the 3gp 5G part and they have an art

198
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,480
slicing and access

199
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,300
and then from the X that the genome B to

200
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,639
the UPF there is the IP network I have

201
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,360
been thinking about like you have a size

202
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,240
and then allocated so like as an ssai

203
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,940
those type of things then how are you

204
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,500
going to map maybe you have already

205
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,779
specified just to ask how are you going

206
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,600
to map from the like as group or those

207
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,279
in our slides to the ietf slides right

208
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,220
yeah so thank you I I think this page is

209
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,399
pretty good for that so the way to map I

210
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,980
think in 3gpp itself is specified in 28

211
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,399
541 you know there's VLAN mpls segments

212
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,380
and other mechanisms by which you

213
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,519
configure the the port in the in the

214
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,040
transport plane the the specific one

215
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,100
that we are proposing here is to use a

216
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,740
UDP Port because and that's in addition

217
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,480
we've also mentioned that in the

218
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,060
document in in the draft because

219
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,339
um when you have if you look at the

220
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,800
figure on the right if you have the

221
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,700
customer ads and the provider ads

222
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,000
separated by an attachment circuit then

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,240
you need to be able to convey that via

224
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,339
those IP semantics so that is covered in

225
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,920
the draft that's so that's how so that's

226
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
the user plane part your question was

227
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,500
more like how does the the 3gpp network

228
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,079
provision it to the G naught b or the

229
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,739
UPF right

230
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,260
and no not on that part the things like

231
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,720
I suppose on the ginobi at the moment

232
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,760
toward the GTP side and three interface

233
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,639
and then that one is like for the 3gbt

234
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,100
is Checker uh overlay well IP is the

235
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,639
underlying here you uh I assume you are

236
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,060
trying to uh provision or Define a IP

237
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,320
based uh the slides well to match the uh

238
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,779
for the NR size not being allocated by

239
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,380
the 3gpp side so uh the genob at that

240
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,139
moment right about N3 there must be some

241
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,660
way to map I think it's just a plan by

242
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,040
introduce the UDP port

243
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,720
um okay well I have in the red part but

244
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,420
yeah yeah I I think uh you're mentioning

245
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,040
if I understand let me see if I

246
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,959
understand it fully you mentioned that

247
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,440
in 3gp page the GTP connection between

248
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,500
yes exactly ginobi and UPF on N3 and

249
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,139
then but the IP is I assume you're

250
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,540
trying to do the uh the underlay on for

251
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,600
the IP side so but you have to map from

252
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,880
the 3gp slides to the IP slides

253
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,579
otherwise you cannot like uh do the uh

254
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,220
the guarantees no I think we I think

255
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,959
it's covered in the draft but I advise

256
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,480
you so just a very brief explanation

257
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,320
that is that the the GTP is configured

258
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,920
via the SMF uh via the N4 and the N2

259
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,079
interfaces so the the IP address

260
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,680
corresponds to the the what is

261
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,760
provisioned via GTP so so there is a

262
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,380
correspondence there

263
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,260
but yeah but but please comment on that

264
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,399
and I

265
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,160
just a comments on roof link okay

266
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,820
just a comment to the previous question

267
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,339
this is an active discussion in tes

268
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:20,459
working group so they have a draft on

269
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,779
this mapping

270
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,620
between 30 people slides to a utf's

271
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,899
light okay so you

272
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,980
I think it's work in progress Okay so

273
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,620
thank you thank you and refer to that as

274
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,240
well thank you

275
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,040
any other questions comments

276
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,060
okay so I think uh John I think uh you

277
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,980
asked for the reviews right I think you

278
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,779
also have a chair review finding we'll

279
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,800
also just do some initial

280
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,940
and also as a working group to do the

281
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,040
reviews right thank you so we can do

282
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
that

283
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,920
so yeah again on the mailing list we

284
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
need some more discussion I think

285
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,199
obvious

286
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,319
no that's this

287
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,359
moving on to the next topic uh

288
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,179
yeah I think the next one is uh one

289
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,480
second

290
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
I'm sorry

291
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
um

292
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,280
so I think the next one we wanted to get

293
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,940
an update on the srv6 document

294
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,799
okay

295
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,320
Eric on the SRV six do you want to say a

296
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,600
few things on where we stand and it's

297
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,219
just quick status update one minute

298
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,679
yeah because it's in your

299
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,080
oh yeah so the the DMM srv6 user playing

300
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,120
document is in

301
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,880
uh ITF less call I think

302
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,020
um

303
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,000
the same objection about it being

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,539
proposed standard uh resurfaced Joel's

305
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,059
concerned about

306
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,299
interfering in 3gp architecture space I

307
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,080
had thought that changing the uh some

308
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,660
sections to be informational uh might

309
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,500
have addressed that uh he told me the

310
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,480
other day that

311
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,799
changing the entire document

312
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,140
informational would address it that just

313
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,600
changing the the sections would what uh

314
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,640
did not somehow so

315
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,100
uh I have reached out to the 3gp

316
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,120
coordination team and uh Lionel from uh

317
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,700
CT who's I think is the is it what are

318
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,020
they called chairs or repertoires or

319
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,900
everything right there yeah okay uh so

320
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,880
you're you're presenting in the next

321
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,380
coordination meeting after this about

322
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,600
the status uh or sorry about uh our

323
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,900
inquiry to ct4 about uh whether or not

324
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,020
it it conflicts her it is in Pages upon

325
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,419
3gpp architecture so

326
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,059
uh otherwise I think there have been

327
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,100
generally no other comments in the ietf

328
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,700
last call uh so I don't know what

329
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,500
happened during the TeleCheck but uh

330
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,780
this is I think the only the only issue

331
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,660
to be resolved one way or the other so

332
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,980
uh just waiting to see how this plays

333
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,980
out uh I have no personal preference for

334
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,679
informational versus PS the Iona

335
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,539
registry affected because first come

336
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,039
first serve so

337
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,539
I mean you could write it on the back of

338
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,280
a napkin and get your number so it's

339
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,520
fine

340
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,700
um uh but I did you know like I I was I

341
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,960
was hoping we could accommodate the the

342
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,640
wishes of the authors and the concerns

343
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,500
of others but maybe there's just no way

344
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,440
to do that so yeah do you want to maybe

345
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,220
correct online yeah

346
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,740
thank you

347
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,500
um yeah from the 3gp side so first of

348
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,179
all we had the same common things that

349
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,299
why it was proposed as um

350
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,640
uh a purpose not out

351
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,100
saying that it was at least at this time

352
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,780
only for information because we are not

353
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,039
even sure that uh uh how it would uh

354
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,020
actually map with the ongoing work

355
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,179
within three gpp and so on so I think

356
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,760
it's fine the other aspect was that uh

357
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,160
we so it was requesting to for some

358
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,100
review from 3gp and as I said the ct4 is

359
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,419
the main group we had already an

360
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,179
activity on that so this message was

361
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,880
sent to 3gpp so I don't know if anyone

362
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
will comment that and uh and my point

363
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,559
would be for you to to know what would

364
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,539
be the next step if whether it is

365
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,580
informational or proposed on that what

366
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,860
would be the next step for for this and

367
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
especially with any coordination with

368
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,660
the 3gp candidate aspects so maybe uh go

369
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,360
on or resume the studio that we had on

370
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,340
this topic in ct4

371
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,380
yeah thank you thank you Lionel for that

372
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,660
feedback it helps I think from the

373
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,039
chairs point of view at least you know

374
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,320
me alone because Saturday is a quarter

375
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,260
so me and from Japan side I think we

376
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,880
made sure that at least based on the

377
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
feedback that we got from the working

378
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,960
group we try to make sure we are in no

379
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,580
part of the specification says we are

380
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,179
overwriting what 3gpp says in 23501 or

381
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,940
whatever document right it's an IDF

382
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,520
specification completely no way it

383
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,620
affects our impacts the 3gp that's that

384
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,820
we made sure

385
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,220
but in somewhere if any of the text is

386
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,799
not aligned with the thought then we

387
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,000
should fix it I think that's Point

388
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,160
number one point number two I think with

389
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,140
respect to informational you know we

390
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,900
based on Joel's early feedback

391
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,520
authors have agreed to pretty much

392
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,919
comply to what he asks for right now if

393
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,900
the new request is to make the entire

394
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,880
document information I don't have

395
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,760
position on that I'll let others and you

396
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,919
know ad really you know figure out the

397
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,700
next steps on it

398
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:50,039
I'll just give you some perspective on

399
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,240
the draft right like I've been following

400
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,400
the draft versions and so on so there's

401
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,200
like Parts in the draft that actually

402
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,880
work within the architecture itself

403
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,380
right so it says like okay like you know

404
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,120
you have the SMF you have the UPF and

405
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,280
this is how we can put other functions

406
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,960
around it to stop the connection between

407
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,400
them and there's Parts where it says

408
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,260
like hey you can do better than the

409
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,000
other architecture I think that's the

410
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,960
parts that have been moved to

411
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,460
informational because it kind of doesn't

412
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,799
fit the architecture so that's where we

413
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,120
are so there is like changes in the

414
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,159
draft that has happened like since the

415
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,480
last time I read it like I read like

416
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,980
version seven or eight or so now it's in

417
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,620
the 21. or something right like so it's

418
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,720
been changed a bit but we need to still

419
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,340
discuss it and see how things go but

420
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,780
that's the perspective so there's stuff

421
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,919
in the draft that's inside the

422
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,480
architecture coloring inside the lines

423
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
and outside as well okay

424
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,919
yeah one last thing is with other than

425
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,020
you know one particular uh feedback

426
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,000
generally the working group is okay with

427
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,039
the document we haven't seen much risks

428
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,659
in any major feedback

429
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,760
so hopefully we'll be able to close this

430
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,620
one issue and more yeah

431
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,100
the schedule of the last call is not

432
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,039
clear to me I have seen the mail that a

433
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,799
couple of weeks what are the exact dates

434
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,539
no that's true because we are preparing

435
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,620
also our

436
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,000
response

437
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,799
Eric you want to deadline on that I

438
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,380
somewhere even I I know the time so that

439
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,320
I look at it so um so hanu so usually

440
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,700
the last call is two weeks right but

441
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,020
since we had an idea week it's going to

442
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,280
be three weeks I think it's November

443
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,039
23rd is the last day on on the last call

444
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,539
I think maybe it's good to put a date

445
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,559
and send

446
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,360
ing the ears in the last call so the

447
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
last call that say November 23rd

448
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,700
thank you

449
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,659
all right uh thank you so much uh next

450
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,059
we moved the

451
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,600
Eric

452
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,740
so this is a new proposal discussions on

453
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,980
integrating am and UPF

454
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,460
uh

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,100
okay so this is uh the follow-up

456
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,340
discussions on the idea of integrating a

457
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,179
n and UPF we allow ads version 2 of this

458
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,260
draft we have a new co-author Kashif

459
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,240
Aslan from Red Hat Next Step please

460
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,480
so um I want to give a brief review of

461
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,100
this basic idea

462
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,480
in 5G UPF are more and more distributed

463
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,480
and close to the Geno BCU

464
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,919
um for

465
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,400
and in the meantime the renting

466
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,740
decomposition is moving the CU

467
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,159
towards the core side so now they meet

468
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,620
in this Edge data center they become

469
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,380
co-located and often if they are

470
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,940
implemented by software they may be

471
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,100
running on the same server but still

472
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
they are separate functions per current

473
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,480
3gp architecture

474
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,159
so what if in 6G we actually integrated

475
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,780
a n

476
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,120
slash CU function

477
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,200
and UPF function into a single function

478
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,220
if we did that we get a flattens routing

479
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,919
switching based architecture where

480
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,320
this integrated device with what we call

481
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,640
the end up

482
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,520
it's basically a router or a switch

483
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,880
that has Wireless and wired connections

484
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,600
just like that IEEE Technologies gives

485
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
you the internet connection to a router

486
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,679
Wi-Fi technology gives your Wi-Fi

487
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,900
connection to a router and now we have

488
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,940
3gpp technology okay with a mobile

489
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,700
wireless connection to a router and the

490
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,480
rest

491
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,500
it's just routing switching for ietf

492
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,700
i3pe standards and all the services or

493
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,380
the features we have deployed for

494
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,360
wireless networks ipvp and evpn whatever

495
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,980
can be just applicable to the wireless

496
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,740
network so that's the basic idea

497
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,580
next slide please

498
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,960
so the work will need to be done in 3gpp

499
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,960
um it's not it's not iitf work but we

500
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,640
are using this DMM menu to discuss the

501
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,700
idea hoping to to get feedback and

502
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,000
especially from mobile operators to see

503
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,880
if this idea makes sense if it does make

504
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,100
sense if the operator wants to see this

505
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,220
deployed then we can bring this to 3gpp

506
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,539
for further discussion for

507
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,700
standardization there

508
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,919
um so this is a picture that shows the

509
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,760
idea today we have the UE and connection

510
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,100
to

511
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,080
r-u-d-u-c-u and then eventually the UPF

512
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,659
being distributed UPF that means that

513
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,980
the data Network that upfg connects to

514
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,440
also needs to be distributed and that

515
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
means that Data Network needs to be

516
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,700
connected together by VPN

517
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,919
so now if you click

518
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,020
just click yeah

519
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,460
so between the UE and CU we have the uh

520
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,860
ue's IP or ethernet traffic on top of

521
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,179
radio stack

522
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,179
and then click

523
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:17,039
this is a PDF actually yeah okay yeah

524
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,620
and then between the CU and UPF is the

525
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,460
same

526
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,640
UE traffic in the gtpu tunnel and next

527
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,700
the CU just does the relay the CU does

528
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,460
not do routing at all it just does relay

529
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,260
and next

530
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,220
so we talk about the the CU UPF and then

531
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,140
and also the PE for the dmvpn

532
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,659
the context that they are collocated in

533
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:45,600
the same Data Center and what if we

534
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,100
combine them into a single device

535
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,080
click done for the next one

536
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,960
so if I may ask a question right so how

537
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,760
is the mobility going to work if you're

538
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,779
bringing UPF so close to the to the CU

539
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,260
the mobility and the handling it does

540
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,279
not change

541
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,260
so today

542
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,600
with distributed UPF

543
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,900
it's it's supposed to handle the handle

544
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,840
Mobility already all we're doing here is

545
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,640
put them into the single function we're

546
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,640
not changing any function yeah next uh

547
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,600
that's great and continue so now that

548
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,779
end up one is a combination of cu1 upf1

549
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:34,500
and pe1 and up two is a combination of

550
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,940
the the CO2 upf2 now the

551
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,299
radio protocol stack comes from ue1 to

552
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,059
end up one directly and then the end up

553
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,340
one just uh that's the routing or

554
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,380
switching there to the local Data

555
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,440
Network or to the remote VPN site that's

556
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,179
the basic idea

557
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,179
foreign

558
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,659
to do this already now isn't this a

559
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,159
deployment issue

560
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,460
what changes if you integrate these

561
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,100
functions into single data center a

562
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,480
single box

563
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,299
what changes um it would involve

564
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,700
signaling changes I have a slide down

565
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,200
that one

566
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,440
okay

567
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,380
uh we talked about this already so skip

568
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,899
the next one so

569
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,200
the advantages that is that um we now

570
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
have a simplified signaling

571
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,520
um an open optimized data plan before

572
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,880
I counted that to establish that entry

573
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,760
paneling between the Geno BCU and UPF

574
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,200
even if they are running on the same

575
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,600
server but be in separate function you

576
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,720
need signaling to establish that tunnel

577
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,299
and it involves seven steps

578
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,299
four Network functions three signaling

579
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,380
interfaces now that is all gone

580
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,760
and also

581
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,720
um

582
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,240
before you need to the genobc you need

583
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,179
to put on gdpu header and immediately

584
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:11,460
taking off by the UPF that is running on

585
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,220
the same server so that brings in now

586
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,260
that is not needed anymore that brings

587
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,640
in the performance Improvement

588
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,760
especially when you're doing this on

589
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,620
servers using software implementation

590
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,960
that's a big win there

591
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,020
yeah

592
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,399
so I think

593
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,320
um I think other than the things you

594
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,760
should be brought up right I think like

595
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,620
and Hano actually brought it up as well

596
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,840
but let's say you hand off between two

597
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,299
genot bees right so right now you can

598
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,399
use like a vertical Handover to kind of

599
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,260
use a sideways interface like X2 or like

600
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,760
whatever is a replacement for that to

601
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,320
actually send back to the same UPF

602
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,600
because UPF is your IP point of presence

603
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,820
right now if you combine it then your IP

604
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,960
point of presence is going to change

605
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,760
your IP address is going to change

606
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,480
right if you hand off to a new G note B

607
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,679
right

608
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,919
right remember the context is that you

609
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,580
already have distributed UPF and the CU

610
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,520
together in the same in the same Edge

611
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,620
data center so what you're talking about

612
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,260
let's say you go handled by the by the

613
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,960
by the current separate CU and UPF

614
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,000
already okay so that is not changing so

615
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,919
your assumption is that there's going to

616
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,020
be multiple

617
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,659
um RR use like that are distributed and

618
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,039
they'll end up at the same CU is that

619
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,960
your base assumption right that does not

620
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,240
change this no no it's not it's not that

621
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,620
it doesn't change you need to state that

622
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,000
has an assumption because it was not

623
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,679
clear like from your presentation that

624
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,120
that's an assumption right so like put

625
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,100
that in and the second thing is like if

626
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,080
you look at like how the SMF talks to

627
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,600
the UPF right uh how the session set up

628
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,980
how the quality of service is set up

629
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,960
it's based on the teid

630
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,940
okay yes so now we're getting rid of the

631
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,440
tid so you're going to come up with a

632
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,460
whole

633
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,140
um

634
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,340
policy control architecture for this

635
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,740
right because that's gone because the

636
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,600
what if you have the CU directly with

637
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,940
the UPF there's no

638
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,520
tunnels to differentiate the things in

639
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,100
there so this is input to you like you

640
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,539
know just think about it I don't want

641
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:07,740
you to give an answer because it's a

642
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,299
difficult answer but if you're going to

643
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,120
change that you're not just changing the

644
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,140
architecture for the data plane but

645
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,220
you're also changing the policy control

646
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,480
architecture

647
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,399
thank you indeed that needs to be

648
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:21,120
changed I actually mentioned it uh

649
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,360
in the previous Ito presentation it does

650
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,100
involve changes in the signaling plane

651
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,980
however we are talking about 6G I'm

652
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,659
pretty sure even if we didn't make this

653
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,299
change there will be big big changes

654
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,419
coming in that right so indeed the

655
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:40,620
changes will happen and in this case if

656
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,179
it does happen it brings in the

657
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,620
simplified signaling yeah

658
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,779
hi uh John from future way I have a

659
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,700
similar question that's how new and to

660
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,799
an extent about Suresh asked about the

661
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,200
te ID and course

662
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,179
um my understanding is that the biggest

663
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,120
challenges are with qos and how that is

664
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,620
sent to the genome B and just putting it

665
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,779
together as one function will not change

666
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,640
those Dynamics and it's all those

667
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,100
queuing delays and so on that needs to

668
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,980
be optimized so I I have the same

669
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,500
opinion as hanu that putting it together

670
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,600
is possible today

671
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,700
uh so combining it takes away the

672
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,980
flexibility of separating it while it

673
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,600
does not address the queuing related

674
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,760
aspects of for example if you have qfis

675
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,399
that are mapped into uh specific

676
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:32,100
entities in the genome B all of those

677
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,500
issues still need to be solved if you

678
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,779
want to get better streamlining so it's

679
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,600
a common thing okay so

680
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,440
um in previous ietf we I have a slide

681
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,980
talking about the class aspects so in in

682
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,980
this one I didn't have a slide for that

683
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,100
I will follow up with you to see if what

684
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,899
I thought about last time that already

685
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,480
addresses that that if not I will add

686
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,559
more article discussions there but here

687
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:04,260
um so I right so far this is just a

688
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,600
review part if you go to the next slide

689
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,739
foreign

690
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,099
so in this new reversion we added quite

691
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,440
a few discussion points

692
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,119
um there's following slides are

693
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,280
basically for those discussion points

694
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,260
one by one so let's just skip this one

695
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,080
let's just go to the specific slides

696
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,339
yeah

697
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:30,000
but I did notice notice uh the NAT here

698
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,480
so in 60

699
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:38,520
so no dependence okay so we already

700
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,199
talked about simplified signaling last

701
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,159
time and then earlier uh here I added

702
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,099
this red text there this is the what I

703
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,580
learned from an operator recently

704
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,359
um

705
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,540
so it turns out that's uh we not only

706
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,480
need to establish the N3 tunnel when it

707
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,180
is first brought up we actually need to

708
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,000
periodically refresh the signaling to

709
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,820
maintain it turns out that is a big

710
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,540
performance hit in the control plane so

711
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,579
by doing this

712
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,980
getting rid of the N3 tunneling when it

713
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,680
is not needed we also reduce it remove

714
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,800
that periodic refreshes entirely so

715
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,920
that's another point I want to add here

716
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,599
next slide please

717
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,980
you're not talking about the GTP of

718
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,599
gdpu gtpu yeah

719
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,140
um one point that came up

720
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,260
is about net so an operator

721
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,079
a large operator may have many regions

722
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,140
than they use the same uh private

723
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,140
address space uh across those different

724
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,560
regions so today they have

725
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,560
in that case they have a net Gateway

726
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,500
attached to each Central UPF and then so

727
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,540
the UE to internet traffic goes through

728
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,520
the net Gateway

729
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,040
UE to UE traffic is intravision does not

730
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,200
go through that you you eat to UE

731
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,839
traffic if it's interesting then it goes

732
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,780
through the net Gateway twice right so

733
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,840
the question was what what happens uh

734
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,220
[Music]

735
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,820
if you do use integrate the end up in

736
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,339
that situation and the answer is that

737
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:27,660
some

738
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,140
even before you'd have the uh n up as

739
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,599
long as you use distribute UPF you have

740
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,400
the same problem that you need to solve

741
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,560
already and the solution is actually the

742
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,980
same so you basically in each region you

743
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,380
have many distributed upfs but you will

744
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,320
have a central router in the data

745
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,619
Network and that's Central The Hub

746
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,500
router will have a Gateway attached

747
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,480
and again the uh yoe to internet traffic

748
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,099
goes through goes through that that

749
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,339
Gateway

750
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:03,180
interregion traffic goes through two

751
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,119
gateways and that already needs to

752
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,880
happen with distribute here and adding

753
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,060
the replacing the integrating the UPF

754
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,339
and Co together into an app does not

755
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,020
change that it's same same thing will

756
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,220
still work

757
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,419
so next

758
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,040
um what about uh

759
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,940
ulcer CEO iupf for Mac so

760
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,060
um for Edge Computing one way to do uh

761
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,640
to do the traffic local breakout is use

762
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,020
this uh uplink classifier iupf

763
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,920
um

764
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,780
that is uh today with 5G even with

765
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,119
Central uh UPF deployment you can do

766
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,180
that already but it is a special an

767
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,460
extra user plane function

768
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,420
it sits in the past of N3 tunnels and it

769
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,960
exams all the industry traffic

770
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,980
and then it intercepts some traffic for

771
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,619
local breakout breakout purpose uh

772
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,960
reason based on the filtering rules

773
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,180
signaled from SMF

774
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,200
so in that case the CU puts on the gtu

775
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,140
encapsulation and then all those traffic

776
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,500
with the GTO header will be exempt by

777
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,480
this uh

778
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,640
ulcer or IOP app and then some of them

779
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,140
build a locally erotic so

780
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,000
that's a waste

781
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,480
of your processing power that is already

782
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,300
avoided by even by distributed up here

783
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,240
and and replacing that distribute UPF

784
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,640
with end up does not change that so

785
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,320
basically

786
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,420
the the

787
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,000
in the Target scenario for the am for

788
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,160
the third n up where you have distribute

789
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,020
UPF collected with a as an or CU

790
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,540
um then you do not need the ulc or UPF

791
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,560
already

792
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,740
and uh

793
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,180
switching towards integrity and up does

794
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,460
not change that

795
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,180
next thing

796
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,760
what some people are worried about that

797
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,660
and now the an does more work it's it's

798
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,640
increased the burden you may overpower

799
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,140
it

800
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,140
um but notice that the context of this

801
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,660
is that we have the

802
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,119
cu

803
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,280
UPF and PE co-located in the same Edge

804
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,540
Data Center

805
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,640
whether you do it separately or

806
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,160
integratively the same thing need to

807
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,380
happen no matter what whether in

808
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,599
separated functions or in this integral

809
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,680
functions

810
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,040
and is in in case of a cloud native

811
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,020
implementation

812
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,859
whether it's the work to be done on the

813
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,380
A and UPF and up does not matter

814
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,800
in fact for capacity planning purposes

815
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,099
it may be easier because before you had

816
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,760
to figure out okay I'm going to allocate

817
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,579
how much compute resource for the CU

818
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,560
function and I need to figure out how

819
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,780
much computer resource I allocate for

820
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,420
the for the UPF function now you don't

821
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,280
have the UPF anymore you just have the

822
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,220
enough and you just you just need to

823
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,900
figure out

824
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,599
which for which video sessions

825
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,359
will will be assigned to wish you a end

826
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,339
up and that's it everything will just

827
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:33,780
the rest is

828
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,940
done

829
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,920
okay

830
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,940
um next slide please

831
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,000
and another question is um

832
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
now the a needs to do more it becomes

833
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,500
more complicated

834
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,220
for that

835
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,700
Keith

836
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,000
I I want to point one fact today

837
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,859
so today on the CU where we put on the

838
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,859
gdpu header and send it to the UPF that

839
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,079
is actually already performing the PE

840
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:11,040
functional identity see think of this uh

841
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,800
put forget about mobile forget about a

842
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,480
water snack for one moment just think

843
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,339
about uh

844
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,160
VPN technology in ietf and the Wireline

845
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,760
we have this concept of hop and spoke

846
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,040
VPN and we have the concept of per

847
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,140
prefix VPN label

848
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,320
so you have the spoke P connecting to

849
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,200
some CE and you can you can advertise

850
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,160
per prefix label so so that's when you

851
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,099
get a traffic with the pro prefix VPN

852
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,740
label you don't need to do iplookup

853
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,440
anymore you based on the VPN label

854
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,900
you'll know exactly which CE to to send

855
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,200
traffic to and that's exactly what this

856
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,180
CEO does

857
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,980
is here so the gtpu tunnel corresponds

858
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,800
to the VPN label stack

859
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,520
today on the CU there is no IP

860
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,579
processing because there is no need for

861
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,280
iplookup because all the Uplink traffic

862
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,060
goes to the central UPF all the downlink

863
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,140
traffic

864
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,440
you have the key ID that tells you which

865
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,040
UE it is for that tid is just like the

866
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,099
per prefix VPN label

867
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:30,540
so today all that is different

868
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,060
from the

869
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,820
ipvpn in the Wildland case is that

870
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,839
we don't have a a vrf on the on the CEO

871
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,520
to do the iplookup but now you for uh

872
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,460
for the purpose of uh Edge Computing or

873
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,859
local internet breakout we want to do

874
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,980
the local routing on the CEO there in

875
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,680
the edge data center there so

876
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,540
we can um

877
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,880
put a look of a vrf there for that

878
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,000
purpose and remember one thing that's uh

879
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,880
today routing functions

880
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,940
are actually being commoditized

881
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,460
it's not it's not difficult to add

882
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,020
routing function to to anymore so

883
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,680
can consider the co-located CU upfmpe

884
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,380
and consider that the benefit of

885
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,079
simplified signaling and optimized data

886
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,920
plan

887
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,040
it makes sense it's feasible to have

888
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,740
this combined function here this does

889
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,880
everything

890
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,880
X

891
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,540
I think this is the final slide here

892
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,900
so one question I got was isn't this

893
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,760
against microservice architecture

894
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,160
because with microservice you're

895
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,900
breaking up everything

896
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,079
and here you're combining everything

897
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,660
you are going against the trend

898
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,740
so I looked up the microservices I found

899
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,740
this on internet it says microservices

900
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,599
architecture style desk right the

901
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,880
structures and application as a

902
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,099
collection of services

903
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:11,460
and the macro service action enables the

904
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,619
rapid frequent and reliable delivery for

905
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,700
large complex applications so to me it

906
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,680
is about decomposing complex

907
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,540
applications

908
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,859
here

909
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,740
n up is about integrating forwarding

910
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,319
functions for the purpose of high

911
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,440
performance data forwarding I don't

912
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,480
think that we

913
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,780
in the in our case we we want to go with

914
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,640
the macro service architecture here

915
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,960
that's my view

916
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,680
it's for different things so

917
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,099
yeah yeah next I think I have one more

918
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:48,660
slide

919
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:54,060
and so basically I I bring this to this

920
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,480
foreign for discussion I appreciate that

921
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,960
uh the odd comments I get and I I want

922
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,480
to see that if you're interested in this

923
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,180
talk to your colleagues on your wireless

924
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,819
site to see this is this it makes sense

925
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,660
to them as well thanks

926
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,500
yes I I recognize that there are some

927
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,319
merits in this proposal but still some

928
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,700
details are not clear to me for instance

929
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,720
multi-access how would you support

930
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,640
multi-access with this

931
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,640
multi-access

932
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,780
um so if you look at this picture we are

933
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,540
basically just combining the uh those

934
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,700
separate functions together so whatever

935
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,359
magic access functions you need in a

936
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:45,060
separate architecture the same should

937
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,540
happen here but we I I let me follow up

938
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,180
with you offline on that yeah thank you

939
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,859
yeah thanks okay

940
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:55,700
Marco

941
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,680
um

942
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,760
thanks a lot for this very interesting

943
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,180
draft and discussion so I really like it

944
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,460
um but as I said it's pretty much 3gpp

945
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,859
specific it discusses footage functions

946
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,839
reference points and that's so correctly

947
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,260
said well if there is acceptance of this

948
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,880
then you need to bring it to three gpp

949
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,480
so for the ietf if we deploy something

950
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,060
like an Anup do you expect any kind of

951
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,520
changes on the remaining interfaces

952
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,800
which have not so spotted here which is

953
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,819
between the UPF and any access

954
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:32,640
application service which is n6 right is

955
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,099
it working as today or do you expect

956
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,339
something that the ITF could do in terms

957
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:41,579
of traffic steering from a service to

958
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,920
the correct anode

959
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,180
there is no change on itf's

960
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,400
side that needed for for this uh uh

961
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,980
proposal the reason I'm talking about

962
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,359
the that here is to gather feedback

963
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,119
and ideally support from the mobile

964
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,900
operators and vendors first if only if I

965
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,660
get enough support from them then I have

966
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,500
a chance to to to get it accepted in 3dp

967
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,260
if I if I don't even get support from

968
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,780
The Operators or from I from the people

969
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,180
who are familiar with and friendly with

970
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,060
IHF Technologies I have there is no

971
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,579
chance I can I can I can get it accepted

972
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,500
on the 3gb side so that's why I'm

973
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,260
talking about here indeed the work will

974
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,359
need to be done in 3gpp but I'm just

975
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,180
trying to First socialize this idea

976
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,640
among people who are familiar with and

977
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,920
friendly with the ITF and Wildland

978
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,960
Technologies okay because some some

979
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,000
early aspects of DMM could be brought in

980
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,800
here right if we deploy something like

981
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,260
an anode and we consider session

982
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,500
continuity uh when moving from one end

983
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,000
up to another one you could do something

984
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,400
with traffic steering unless you treat

985
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,160
the previously assigned and SM anchor

986
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,260
and remain anchored there until you

987
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,819
change the IP address of the user

988
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,740
equipment but okay thanks for the

989
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,300
clarification thanks

990
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,780
[Music]

991
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,700
thank you very much for interesting this

992
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,859
question just comment um

993
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:12,960
when we see the the structure of the

994
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,380
cgpp organization we can see the land

995
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,780
you can see it's a we can see the city

996
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,359
that's the very fundamental architecture

997
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,540
actually so all of the ecosystem follow

998
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,880
that tactics right now so your proposal

999
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,640
seems that corrupts that's

1000
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,980
fundamental architecture but it's really

1001
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,839
interesting for the architecture

1002
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,520
consideration

1003
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,780
yeah it's it's indeed a big big change

1004
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,940
I don't know you will happen or not but

1005
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,859
I'm just trying to

1006
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:49,440
to see if we can get feedback and

1007
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,440
support first and then bring to 3gpp

1008
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,240
yeah Lana

1009
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,980
more uh yes another feedback from from a

1010
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,579
three gpp point of view actually

1011
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,160
it would be seen only as a deployment

1012
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,920
option so for instance today you can you

1013
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,079
can deploy the private mobile networks

1014
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,819
using this configuration if you want you

1015
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:14,760
can even encapsulate all the radio parts

1016
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,700
it will be a black box for them the only

1017
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,079
thing that will matter is the link

1018
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:20,819
between the you in the box and the box

1019
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:25,200
and the rest what whatever the rest so

1020
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,700
if it is something that need to be

1021
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,339
bringing uh to a UTF it's some things

1022
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:31,140
that you you need to highlight what

1023
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,760
needs to be changed according to the

1024
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,060
existing specification

1025
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,680
what's sorry what's needed to be a lens

1026
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,099
or added and after that I I would be

1027
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,040
agree with um with Marco is that if

1028
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,920
actually you use this configuration to

1029
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,859
add more DMM related functionalities it

1030
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:52,380
would be more on a GF matter than a 3gp

1031
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,520
mother

1032
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,920
so for instance we have already a cases

1033
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,760
for UPF SMF co-location upfimf

1034
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,440
collocation but from an architecture

1035
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,060
point of view it's not really relevant

1036
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,160
from svgpp we're just speaking about the

1037
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,500
functionality the signaling but what uh

1038
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,900
anything regarding the deployments it's

1039
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,720
really for the vendor side or for the

1040
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,400
operator side

1041
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,240
right so for the co-location indeed does

1042
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,720
not reinvolve any changes at all but

1043
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,099
um I by integrate them to um

1044
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,800
uh if you want to simplify the signaling

1045
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,619
part then that indeed does involve 3dp

1046
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,319
changes and that indeed needs to to be

1047
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,560
accepted by 3gpp for it to to happen in

1048
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,980
and at all so that's the part that uh we

1049
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,319
won't need to bring to 3gpp after we get

1050
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:45,560
support

1051
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,520
if I make

1052
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,160
um not really if you said if everything

1053
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,980
is in a box whatever the type of bugs

1054
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,200
uh what's happened in the Box it's only

1055
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,359
relevant to the vendor or to zero

1056
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,400
operator you you don't have to comply

1057
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,380
always as a signaling defined as a

1058
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,000
specification so if you have something

1059
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,819
ending between the CU UPF or UPF or

1060
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:07,559
something and inside the bus it's not

1061
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,760
really a relevant but today today you

1062
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,099
have separate signal into the CU and and

1063
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:17,640
UPF and then that I counted seven steps

1064
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,280
to establish that N3 tunnel in there and

1065
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,640
that could be removed by by signaling

1066
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,680
changes and it's why I'm saying so it

1067
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,599
could be relevant in that case but from

1068
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,520
a 3gp point of view we really don't care

1069
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,020
the only thing that would matter in that

1070
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,780
case is that what's come from the DU and

1071
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,660
west house from the UPF if everything is

1072
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,160
fine there you can do whatever you want

1073
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,319
for instance I have example where we are

1074
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,540
using a

1075
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,240
um mesh architecture and so on machine

1076
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,520
learning in a box even if it is not

1077
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,040
defined by 3gpp but as long as you have

1078
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,859
everything good for the input and the

1079
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,680
output it's uh it's up to to your

1080
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,619
implementation but here I I should have

1081
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,520
drawn the AMF and SMF in this picture

1082
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,800
because today there's enter signaling

1083
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,680
between AMF and CU and M4 signal between

1084
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,940
SMF and UPF that part can be simplified

1085
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,880
so that you don't have to have those

1086
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,460
seven steps of the signaling to see

1087
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,040
establish a tunnel between the two

1088
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,740
software entities and running on the

1089
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,440
same server that part could be optimized

1090
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,200
okay last comment on this solution I

1091
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,799
think okay

1092
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,839
and uh Jeff not the first time I heard

1093
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,599
this one you know beside the Techno part

1094
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,240
I truly suggest you bring this one to

1095
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,940
three GBP first

1096
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,579
um to discuss here since the no matter

1097
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,980
what you're going to achieve here and

1098
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,900
the final call is still there so it's

1099
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,400
like search

1100
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,559
yeah thanks to Angie so I I think the

1101
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:56,819
feedback you should take like at least

1102
00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:58,619
like from everybody like you know like

1103
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:00,660
what Hana said like Marco said like you

1104
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,819
know John said

1105
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:05,640
um and Lionel said as well right so this

1106
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,980
is possible today so if your thing is

1107
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,240
like the other thing should not be

1108
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,579
possible I think you're gonna face like

1109
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:14,700
an uphill task in 3gpp right so to give

1110
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,920
you an example right this SMF and UPF

1111
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,140
right so they got an N4 in between with

1112
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,460
pfcp

1113
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,380
um there's like I've seen like hundreds

1114
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,760
of networks where they're in the same

1115
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,160
box and there's no externally visible

1116
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,780
info interface they use some kind of

1117
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,940
internal things if you do that the same

1118
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,740
way as an implementation like combine

1119
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,319
this to have your implementation be more

1120
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,900
performant that's fine but it should

1121
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,260
still have the same IES on the N4 and if

1122
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,500
it's able to look at the ID and map it

1123
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,940
to some internal thing that you do

1124
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,800
everything should work as I think that's

1125
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,960
like what Lionel is pointing to and I

1126
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,119
think 100 days as well before to say

1127
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,940
this is possible today so but if is to

1128
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,319
take away the other option where it's

1129
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,480
like not co-located I think that's going

1130
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,339
to be a harder sell than that so I think

1131
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:01,440
that's the feedback you should take from

1132
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,119
this discussion there's nothing saying

1133
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,819
this is bad but this is not like a win

1134
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:07,800
only so there's losses right on the

1135
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,020
mobility front you you lose like you

1136
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,640
probably do like more handovers than

1137
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,619
needed so there's all and the policy

1138
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,059
control changes so I think you need to

1139
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:16,980
balance these two having this as an

1140
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,660
option is interesting and this is the

1141
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,059
only option probably not

1142
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:22,800
um thank you so I have two characters

1143
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,900
one here

1144
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,599
um this is not the only option the end

1145
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,880
up can still do the N3 tunnel into a

1146
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,640
separate UPF when it is needed second of

1147
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,420
all

1148
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,520
um secondly the

1149
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,460
indeed with today's separate signaling

1150
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,440
N2 and then four signaling this can be

1151
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,839
done in the same box with internal

1152
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:46,140
optimization however I still see that

1153
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,059
the signal in the separate signaling

1154
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,920
could be simplified instead of doing

1155
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,819
seven step uh uh signaling involving

1156
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,520
four Network functions and three three

1157
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,359
interfaces we we only need to involve a

1158
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:03,540
two Network functions and two steps I

1159
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,420
think that is a optimization that we uh

1160
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,540
I would like to see accepted and since

1161
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,240
3db said but indeed this needs to be

1162
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,339
discussed in 3dp and I'm actually going

1163
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:17,300
to tools next week okay and socialize

1164
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,400
socializing there as well okay so oh

1165
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,020
thank you Jeffrey I think my final

1166
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,119
comment on this I think good stuff I

1167
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,700
think like all the feedback I think

1168
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,559
there's some merits in this proposal I

1169
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,780
think the key thing is what you want

1170
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,059
from ietf is also the key discussion

1171
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:35,700
point I we cannot touch the 3gp pieces

1172
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,680
to architecture but if they're for

1173
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,900
supporting such an architecture if you

1174
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,880
if you need some extensions some

1175
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,160
protocol something I think that would be

1176
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,720
a one very much relevant discussion

1177
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,400
that's one point and on the technical

1178
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,079
front if you look at Enterprise private

1179
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,540
5G we have also collapsed functions into

1180
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,480
a single thing and in the process if the

1181
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,160
control plane is outside there's certain

1182
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,780
optimizations you're absolutely right

1183
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,000
right if those optimizations how do we

1184
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,619
standardize again you need to go back to

1185
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:05,040
3gpp but yeah I think more discussions

1186
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,839
if you need something for ETF welcome

1187
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,900
yeah uh or a quick response to that so

1188
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,760
on ietf site we do not need any changes

1189
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,160
um I appreciate this venue here to

1190
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,440
discuss this but otherwise I don't know

1191
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,839
any iitf changes okay good thank you

1192
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,240
good to hear that thanks thank you you

1193
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,279
all right next one is uh

1194
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:34,579
excuse

1195
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,480
okay

1196
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,900
uh this

1197
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,780
AI service mobile user okay yeah

1198
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,920
hello um this is saturu I'm present here

1199
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,400
some update on SRB mobile is a plane

1200
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,700
architecture for DMM on behalf of the my

1201
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,640
course thought um from the uh SoftBank

1202
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,339
accounts Cisco the Canada

1203
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,460
dot com and Intel

1204
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,900
so on next slide please

1205
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,520
so this is the update from zero three to

1206
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,940
zero four uh what we made on this our

1207
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,339
division was mainly on the illustration

1208
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,700
section you can see the old

1209
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,800
um

1210
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,319
zero three draft we put just

1211
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:34,079
illustration of the year one section

1212
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,740
only but we structured this illustration

1213
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,339
section with the uh four Subs section

1214
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:45,300
the first one is how to accommodate a

1215
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,760
service network for the existing mobile

1216
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,619
network service

1217
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:52,980
um second one is SRB map PE deployment

1218
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,440
at all Sr domain egress

1219
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,980
it's just what I presented in the

1220
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,099
previous IDF meeting you can find that

1221
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:04,200
and third one is adding direct segment

1222
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,160
with new service map PE this is also I

1223
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,339
presented before so please find that and

1224
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:14,339
I include that model uh in the appendix

1225
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:15,720
right

1226
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,020
the last one is corrupt a service map P

1227
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,720
deployment this is a new one which I run

1228
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,540
a drug to

1229
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:28,819
assure what that looks like

1230
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:33,660
thank you so this is the uh how the

1231
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,680
crops a service map P deployment works

1232
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,380
on the left hand side this is the

1233
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,339
control plane figure how it works so on

1234
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,440
the uh

1235
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,540
control plane side at the map controller

1236
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,460
receive the system information from the

1237
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,359
uh mobile Mobility management system and

1238
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:57,900
then map controller create the uh two

1239
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,440
type of the session transform route for

1240
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,420
each uh system type 1 for downlink type

1241
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,440
2 for Uplink for all the system

1242
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,619
transform the route received at the map

1243
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:14,839
PE

1244
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:18,500
exists on the the border between the uh

1245
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,119
Intel work segment for existing mobile

1246
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,960
mobile search Network and the course

1247
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,119
side of the map PE is your usual SRB

1248
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:33,180
sick backbone not special on the demote

1249
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,780
P it's not a service map aware

1250
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,440
because the uh once map P deceived the

1251
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,839
system Transformer route from map

1252
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:46,819
controller map PE in uh

1253
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:51,180
advertise the corresponding uh loud for

1254
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,900
the UE as a usual

1255
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,480
s3ppm net or routing information that's

1256
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,540
you have control Frame Works on the user

1257
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,940
print view you can see this

1258
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:07,859
um I highlighted only on the map aware

1259
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:09,599
PE

1260
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,280
it's usually

1261
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,680
um other deployment model

1262
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,720
the owpe

1263
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,680
um accepts the rpe uh connecting to the

1264
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,339
UPF need to be map aware but in this

1265
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:24,900
deployment model

1266
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,160
the ma

1267
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,700
the map area P only can exist on the

1268
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,880
side of the interbox segment side in the

1269
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,920
5G architecture case which is the

1270
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,900
industry interface

1271
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,819
that's how the uh new deployment model

1272
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:43,740
uh might be corrupt map P development

1273
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,319
looks like and how it works

1274
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,839
okay

1275
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:51,980
so next slide please

1276
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,079
so what you can see um

1277
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,480
we added

1278
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,880
um

1279
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,380
the deployment model in the illustration

1280
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,040
section and we will continue to update

1281
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:11,040
make much uh precise and clarify the how

1282
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,339
to better understanding

1283
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:15,780
and

1284
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:18,299
I think it we

1285
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,680
could

1286
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,079
reach the certain level of the maturity

1287
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,700
of these documents so um

1288
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,799
please review it and if you are testing

1289
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,220
please uh inform us whether it will be

1290
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,980
uh time to adopt the RTA working group

1291
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,420
document

1292
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,680
okay

1293
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,319
thank you thank you any questions

1294
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,359
comments on this proposal

1295
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:48,079
mistake

1296
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,520
uh yeah am I gonna have people

1297
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,599
complaining to me about architectural

1298
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:57,000
something something

1299
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,460
about this as well

1300
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,760
yay okay

1301
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,319
do we have a plan for

1302
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,960
addressing this is a individual uh ID

1303
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,780
not a working group document right no

1304
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,880
it's a proposal

1305
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,380
okay

1306
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,000
is your intention to but your intention

1307
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,160
is the secret option

1308
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,760
if it is the right timing um I think we

1309
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,740
could continue the uh the work in the

1310
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,400
individual draft but um if we can

1311
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,520
collect the uh enough uh interest I can

1312
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,780
ask the other option

1313
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,400
document or DMM

1314
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,740
so so on this I have one question now to

1315
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,640
Eric

1316
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,700
can IDF make like how Margaret made

1317
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,680
recommendation for IPv6 prefix

1318
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,240
allocations right

1319
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,780
back in 2012 time frame or earlier right

1320
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,299
for PDN sessions right so in other words

1321
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:57,299
making recommending 3gp to instead of

1322
01:02:57,299 --> 01:02:59,880
allocating individual IP addresses do a

1323
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,220
prefix allocation in the same manner and

1324
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,680
fashion right can we publish some of

1325
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,480
these architectural recommendations

1326
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,240
it's not in our scope but can three IET

1327
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,859
have made a recommendation

1328
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:12,660
just I'm trying to see a path for some

1329
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,099
of these work items right which we

1330
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:16,260
cannot touch right but can we make a

1331
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,400
recommendation

1332
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,660
if there is consensus

1333
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,020
uh I mean I think I could take Joel's

1334
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,220
Point here that it could be

1335
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,140
informational like this is a way you

1336
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,819
could do it okay

1337
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:31,079
um

1338
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:35,819
I don't uh I I'm not yeah I'm not fully

1339
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:37,740
aware of all the sensitivities about how

1340
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,780
the uvp feels about their extra I know

1341
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,400
that like a lot of people run a lot of

1342
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,520
different combinations of of stuff not

1343
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,260
everybody runs the whole

1344
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,359
I know all of the interfaces and that

1345
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:49,559
kind of stuff right I mean there's lots

1346
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,180
of different deployment models all right

1347
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,220
let me clarify the the standpoint of

1348
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,559
these uh document of the architecture

1349
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:58,440
document so yeah the draft currently on

1350
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,980
the ID rascore is the um the protocol

1351
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,559
and the under uh under the uh 5G

1352
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,480
architecture

1353
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,920
to be followed

1354
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,859
because yeah we followed we follow that

1355
01:04:10,859 --> 01:04:13,440
architecture and study that protocol

1356
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,380
under the 5G architecture in 3gpp as

1357
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,079
well and then this is the outside of the

1358
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:21,059
3gpp architecture but this is just

1359
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:24,480
programming uh if operator

1360
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,099
want to

1361
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:27,599
use

1362
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,180
there's no nothing happened unless the

1363
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,220
uh the map controller receives the

1364
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,720
session information from the existing

1365
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,380
Mobility Network the list of the part of

1366
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,780
the network network is totally outside

1367
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:44,040
with the 3G 5G architecture this is yeah

1368
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,900
just ITF Network follow the SRV Sr

1369
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,660
architecture so no impact to 3gp system

1370
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,700
yeah okay that was essentially my

1371
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,960
question does this impact the

1372
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,280
architecture and we're going to have

1373
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,420
questions about

1374
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:00,420
so

1375
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,799
um does it impact the architecture I I

1376
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,780
think kind of right like because

1377
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,359
um so if you look at the so Eric just to

1378
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:14,700
give you a brief on the like the goal of

1379
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,460
this right so this is like more into a

1380
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,280
3gpp operators rather than 3gpp right so

1381
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,900
the the idea is like there's some kind

1382
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,220
of use cases like you know if you look

1383
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,480
at like you know fixed Wireless or

1384
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,920
something right where all the

1385
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,660
heavyweight stuff is not required so

1386
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,040
this is like recommendation saying like

1387
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,920
hey for some of the use cases like like

1388
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,660
you know you can do something simpler

1389
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,880
it's like what this draft is trying to

1390
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,460
do so it's it's possible that it says

1391
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,660
like hey some of these things are not

1392
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,640
probably needed for you right I think we

1393
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,140
need to find a sensitive way of saying

1394
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,520
that right but that's what this is

1395
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,140
you're saying like Okay like you know if

1396
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,540
you have uh like best effort traffic

1397
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,760
only and you don't need accounting for

1398
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,680
it this is how you can do it I think

1399
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,619
that's the line he's taking so whether

1400
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,299
or not that like infringes that's

1401
01:05:57,299 --> 01:05:58,680
something we need to discuss for sure

1402
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,200
right but uh that is the line it's

1403
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,059
taking and and it and this can be fuel

1404
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,559
information so there's nothing really

1405
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,020
that needs to to happen so this is using

1406
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,059
IDF protocols from all I don't think

1407
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:10,260
there's any new protocol development

1408
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,420
required for this but Suresh on that

1409
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,760
right the question is would 3gpp object

1410
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,380
to doing this kind of we don't ask a

1411
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,400
question we don't know it's possible

1412
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,859
it's certainly possible because there is

1413
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:21,420
um some way saying like hey like you

1414
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,460
know but should it happen in 3gpp right

1415
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,500
because like I'm sure like 3gpp may be

1416
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,640
interested in saying hey like you know

1417
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,200
for these use cases maybe this is better

1418
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,940
so I don't know the answer we cannot

1419
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,859
answer that up front but I think like

1420
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,480
keep the communication lines open like

1421
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,819
Lionel is there like Hunter is there so

1422
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:37,140
kind of keep the lines open and Saturday

1423
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:40,260
is like in 3gbp too so like kind of get

1424
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,000
I don't know for like release I don't

1425
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,319
know 19 or something like you know

1426
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,780
putting it stage one for this right I

1427
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,980
don't know like study item or something

1428
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,319
I think would be good to at least go and

1429
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:50,700
explore the problems with somewhere as

1430
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,079
well like in parallel like I don't think

1431
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,119
he's like needs to stop your work on

1432
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,260
this but yeah

1433
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,900
all right thank you sir Eric yeah okay

1434
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,940
that's it thank you so I think the key

1435
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,680
takeaways I think you know I think as

1436
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,240
long as we are not touching the 3gp

1437
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,339
System point number one generally if

1438
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:06,660
it's informational and if there are no

1439
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,579
major objections there are no objections

1440
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:11,280
from 3gpp and if they believe IDF is a

1441
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,039
good forum to continue doing this work I

1442
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:16,020
think that's that's something to vibrate

1443
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,940
I think thanks for again for the

1444
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,260
presentation if there are no other

1445
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,240
comments we oh yeah please

1446
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,760
[Music]

1447
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,420
uh interesting work but from your

1448
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,039
explanation here

1449
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,619
I'm seeing is an obviously significant

1450
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:35,339
impact to the 3gbp uh process or

1451
01:07:35,339 --> 01:07:38,339
procedure flow here no impact okay let

1452
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,980
me explain okay

1453
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,780
um because when I think we should reach

1454
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,119
our question about okay your mob

1455
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,000
controller and you say okay this one has

1456
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,420
to get some sort of information from 3gp

1457
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,339
5G system

1458
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:55,319
so I'm trying to think okay how you're

1459
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:57,839
going to get it and then you can you can

1460
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,240
use like the edge Computing uh scenario

1461
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,819
to kill like AF guidance those type of

1462
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:04,079
things

1463
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,059
but the thing is

1464
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:09,839
um to expose some 5G system information

1465
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,180
to our third party

1466
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,700
that is one the first thing you have to

1467
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,620
address

1468
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,859
the second one is the things like the

1469
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:22,198
I think you have to get a true way it's

1470
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,600
not just like a one-way from 5G to you

1471
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,000
or your system and your system to 5G

1472
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,198
here

1473
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:31,738
so I think this type of things

1474
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,439
and then suppose you do uh use some sort

1475
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:37,920
of Make Your Mark controlled as the AF

1476
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,319
and like AF guidance and it goes through

1477
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,679
the nef and PCF those type of things

1478
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:48,600
but the problem here is you have to

1479
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,060
um not just the study items stage one

1480
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,939
stage two is is really that is a bit

1481
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:56,580
beyond what you are doing right now here

1482
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,799
because there you have to like from PCF

1483
01:08:58,799 --> 01:08:59,880
you have to

1484
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,799
at least that you tell

1485
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:05,160
um the thing involved in this picture

1486
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,738
here but even if you are not describing

1487
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:10,560
like the ginobi part the UPF but the

1488
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,120
thing is they are on the data plan

1489
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,698
so I actually you know you have to think

1490
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:19,080
about that thing

1491
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,359
especially like from your map controller

1492
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,520
how are you going to get those

1493
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,520
information exposure that is big I would

1494
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,939
say a big uh story from 5G system thank

1495
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,560
you thank you

1496
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,799
um I think I would recommend to release

1497
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,259
the uh the document because the map

1498
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:40,080
controller just expose the entire API

1499
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,600
whether using API or not it totally

1500
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,819
depends on the operator decision and

1501
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:49,020
then what if the CPP want to utilize

1502
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,779
that interface that's fine so just open

1503
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:56,280
the interface for for uh one to this

1504
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:56,900
um

1505
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,400
underlying of

1506
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:05,100
the network and mechanism just that

1507
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,380
I can try to answer change this question

1508
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:09,540
that map controller

1509
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,540
can run M4 interface the SM you can even

1510
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,699
think of that map controller is the

1511
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,860
control plane of a traditional Central

1512
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,239
UPF

1513
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,940
so three talk that Central Europe

1514
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,699
traditional Central UTF talks m42 SMF

1515
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:26,100
and then send out pgp signal messages it

1516
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,679
could be whether the uh entity on this

1517
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,080
HP design whether it is a UPS whether it

1518
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,179
is SMF it's totally out of the scope of

1519
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:34,580
this document

1520
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:37,380
still the I think the acceleration line

1521
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,040
next

1522
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,719
yeah and

1523
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,380
so it seems like the mob controller or

1524
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,880
Jeffrey explained here you can make a

1525
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,640
latches like uh SML work or some things

1526
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,520
the steel the things like you have to

1527
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,980
introduce that one I'm not sure you're

1528
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,679
going into the function as uh uh inside

1529
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:01,920
the SMF or we're going to introduce some

1530
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,560
I don't think you have any I don't think

1531
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,100
you can introduce one network function

1532
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,020
so that that's the shot is for the AF

1533
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:13,679
part some trusted third part AF

1534
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,860
but the thing is as you keep saying

1535
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,880
okay

1536
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,960
um Let me clarify this is actually uh

1537
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,199
independent from any specific Mobility

1538
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,540
management system any Mobility

1539
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,980
management system can you tell these

1540
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,679
mechanism not depends on the just 5G not

1541
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,120
depends on just uh 4G or 3G or 6G p mip

1542
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,300
and the other Mobility management

1543
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,040
appeared all of the mobility management

1544
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,239
system can't see the uh some programming

1545
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,880
option to carry the RW the print packet

1546
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,640
over the srbc network that's the idea of

1547
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,860
this architecture not to depend on the

1548
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,260
specific Mobility architecture I

1549
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,600
understand you want to use this idea and

1550
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,300
we for your 5G Network I understand so

1551
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,820
please propose that I work for the item

1552
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,580
to the 3dp I work I happily work with

1553
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,739
you on 3dpp

1554
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,900
um if you want to okay

1555
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,420
um and I think well thank you for that

1556
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,159
one I'd like to work with you on that

1557
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,620
part well by the way I think Jeffrey

1558
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,179
mentioned the next week in totals they

1559
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:20,040
are going to be a big meeting on 3gbp

1560
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,860
another part is I you keep seeing for

1561
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,260
the mob controller I think that one is

1562
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,900
the true way it's like uh you have to

1563
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,260
get some exposure from 5gs and also and

1564
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,840
also you have to tell something to 5gs

1565
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,000
so that is uh something I uh is uh

1566
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,219
you know it's very sensitive for that

1567
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:46,140
part yeah okay thank you thank you and I

1568
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,880
don't see any other questions I think

1569
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,620
what are the next steps from your point

1570
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,000
of view

1571
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,040
um please let me know if

1572
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,500
you are interested in so um I want to

1573
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:02,100
correct the boys and feedback thank you

1574
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,420
all right thank you

1575
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:12,960
[Music]

1576
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,960
John

1577
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,080
right now

1578
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,600
yeah

1579
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,480
okay okay this one I'm also a quarter

1580
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,040
maybe Saturday should run this

1581
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,640
discussion yeah

1582
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,739
um so this is a new draft uh on media

1583
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:45,719
header extensions for the wireless

1584
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:47,640
networks

1585
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,420
um

1586
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,640
so

1587
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,000
um this has I mean for it has a lot of

1588
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,120
Transport layer impact but also the

1589
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,560
architecture is related to the mobile

1590
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,960
network environment particularly so

1591
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,840
hence the request for some input or

1592
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,480
feedback from this group so if you go to

1593
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,019
the next place

1594
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,960
how much

1595
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,100
okay

1596
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,159
so this is divided into I mean I'll

1597
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:18,840
divide it in three parts first provide

1598
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,659
the motivation for this

1599
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:23,520
um you know and it's essentially about

1600
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,560
the latency and bandwidth requirements

1601
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,300
that media packets have especially in

1602
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,400
the wireless network and the link

1603
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,739
capacity variation that needs to be

1604
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:32,940
addressed

1605
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,820
and why the end-to-end congestion

1606
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:39,239
control itself may not be sufficient

1607
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:42,000
um the so there are two parts in this

1608
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,159
one is what kind of metadata may be

1609
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:47,280
needed uh to each packet to help the

1610
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,840
wireless network along

1611
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,620
and the other aspect is if this metadata

1612
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,960
needs to be provided how how will that

1613
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,000
be transported from the

1614
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,100
uh the application to the wireless

1615
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,780
network

1616
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:04,880
so if you go to the next page please

1617
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,219
yeah

1618
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:10,679
so the motivation for this I mean this

1619
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:12,719
figure is really showing

1620
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,820
um a couple of things I mean one if you

1621
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,179
look from the UE to the wireless network

1622
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:22,320
it's showing the change in the rate of

1623
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,719
um that the wireless network provides

1624
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,960
and that that changes rapidly much

1625
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,120
faster than an end-to-end congestion

1626
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,760
control can signal that change so in

1627
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,260
other words I mean we think that the

1628
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,600
end-to-end congestion signal can give

1629
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,300
you an average rate but it does not give

1630
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,940
you that instantaneous rate change that

1631
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,739
occurs in the order of hundreds of

1632
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,420
milliseconds and not in the order of

1633
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,820
maybe half a second or a second

1634
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:51,719
so the network operator then has to

1635
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:54,600
either choose to provide it at the

1636
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,340
lowest level which would be under

1637
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,219
utilizing the network or if you utilize

1638
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:01,800
a network to the full extent then there

1639
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,500
will be buffer overflows which

1640
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,020
if nothing else is specified it would be

1641
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:10,260
random drops and random drops in a media

1642
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,900
case for example if you have an iframe

1643
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,780
and it's dropped what happens is that

1644
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,880
some congestion signaling will feed it

1645
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,080
back either via ecn or with our rtcp and

1646
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,480
then it will resend the iframe maybe

1647
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,400
with priority but all of that is going

1648
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,219
to increase a load and not approach the

1649
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:31,080
situation again it delay and other

1650
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,300
things are impacted just for

1651
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,520
clarification to the group The iframe

1652
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,000
why the iframe is important is because

1653
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,940
other frames that follow like a p or a B

1654
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:45,780
frame are dependent on the iframe itself

1655
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,420
so if that is dropped randomly I mean

1656
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,340
because with without any other

1657
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,960
specification it's going to be drop

1658
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,060
random randomly you know

1659
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,159
um and that's not a good situation what

1660
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:59,280
we're requesting for is some way to

1661
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,840
handle this kind of mechanism and I'll

1662
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,080
get to that in the next page but to go

1663
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,719
to the second bullet now

1664
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,840
um you know in 3gpp for the time being

1665
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,659
we've looked at

1666
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:16,140
RTP and srtp which expose headers which

1667
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,120
carry what kind of a packet it is

1668
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,980
whether it's a dependent packet or an

1669
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,780
independent packet where it starts and

1670
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:25,620
stops and based on that you can classify

1671
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,480
these packets and give information to

1672
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,080
the radio scheduler to act in a specific

1673
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,300
way but once you go to something like

1674
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,040
HTTP 3

1675
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,020
this all of this information is lost and

1676
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,840
I suppose even with RTP cryptex

1677
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,219
um you know all of this information is

1678
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:44,280
going to be lost and the scheduler does

1679
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,380
not have the ability to make any

1680
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,880
informed decision and so it's going to

1681
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,300
do random random decisions on topic

1682
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,420
so that's the problem that we face and

1683
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,920
so if you go to the next page we'll

1684
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,679
cover the what kind of metadata we would

1685
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,900
like to get from the application and

1686
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:03,960
then the how we want to transport it

1687
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,060
also so

1688
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,940
um you know the metadata is obviously

1689
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:10,620
very sensitive information and this

1690
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,780
would be between two trusted endpoints

1691
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,300
uh in the wireless network and the

1692
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,760
application server so it's not exposed

1693
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,040
data that's sent

1694
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,659
um you know like dscp or something on

1695
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:24,300
the wire it's we expect that it will be

1696
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:27,900
handled in a secure way and um you know

1697
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:30,120
between the two endpoints but the main

1698
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,659
data that is required is not to encode

1699
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:35,699
or decode the packet but rather to

1700
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:38,219
handle it in the radio network and the

1701
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:41,580
radio network uh would perhaps require

1702
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,920
these three at least and hopefully only

1703
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,380
these uh the priority or importance

1704
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,840
level of a packet or a series of packet

1705
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,940
that belongs to that same group

1706
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:54,420
like an iframe and I think I mentioned

1707
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:56,820
the example earlier itself so if there's

1708
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,020
a congestion

1709
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,719
even if it is discarded the application

1710
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,300
will have to resend it so that's not a

1711
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,260
situation we want and if

1712
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,880
the network can handle it better to

1713
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,500
where it is sent

1714
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,500
in the first place then the application

1715
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,239
performance and everything is improved

1716
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:17,460
in in a better way you know so there are

1717
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,820
these dependencies that

1718
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:22,500
and importance that is being addressed

1719
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,100
here the second is Packet burst if the

1720
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,159
scheduler knows how much I mean it looks

1721
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:31,219
like these are heavy-tailed

1722
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:34,440
applications I mean the the packets

1723
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,500
arrival rate so

1724
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,020
if this information is provided for

1725
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,500
example how big that burst is then the

1726
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,600
scheduler can prioritize a change

1727
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,960
resources to be able to handle that

1728
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,679
burst in in the right way you know by it

1729
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:54,600
cannot create resource but it can handle

1730
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,940
it can re-prioritize and handle these in

1731
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:59,820
a better way and the last is with

1732
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,219
respect to delay budgets

1733
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,739
um if it's known as you know some are

1734
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:07,679
not delay critical so since there is um

1735
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,500
I mean the link changes go up and down

1736
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,760
it could um you know re-prioritize aware

1737
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,440
um some packets that have more of a

1738
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,800
delay budget is delayed to when when the

1739
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,159
resources come back up again and uh you

1740
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:24,900
know during the time when there is only

1741
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,840
very little budget available then those

1742
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,920
with a very short time delay are sent

1743
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,699
along so those are the three uh aspects

1744
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,340
that we think are essential maybe there

1745
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,920
are a few smaller things but we will

1746
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,940
have to look at this is the first

1747
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,140
version the draft will be looking for

1748
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:45,540
feedback from this group too so if you

1749
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,500
go to the next page

1750
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,219
this is about the transport of the

1751
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:54,840
metadata itself

1752
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,719
and you know there are three options I

1753
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:59,340
mean that you know this is not something

1754
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,900
we've come up with this is something

1755
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,900
that the 3gpp study has looked at and

1756
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,980
um you know there are these three

1757
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,679
options that that look interesting but

1758
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,960
each has a problem of his own or

1759
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,420
advantages and disobeyances you know

1760
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,640
media over quick extension

1761
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:18,360
if for example if this uh transport I

1762
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,199
mean if the 3gp Network looks as a relay

1763
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,880
then and it also transports this

1764
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,280
metadata then you know that would be one

1765
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,260
option but then this is restricted to

1766
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:32,699
http 3 data but uh you know we'd have to

1767
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:36,420
deal with RTP and http 3.

1768
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,040
UDP options on the other hand will cover

1769
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,900
all these cases but then we have to

1770
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,260
consider how we Expose and get this

1771
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,659
information for the UDP option to

1772
01:21:45,659 --> 01:21:47,100
transport it along

1773
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,020
and then there's mask encapsulation

1774
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,480
which avoids the need for major

1775
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,580
standardization but then you incur a lot

1776
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,880
of overhead in terms of the UPF behaving

1777
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,840
like a proxy and you know encrypting I

1778
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,000
mean creating a mask tunnel and getting

1779
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,719
it back to just get the metadata so each

1780
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,520
of these has

1781
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,920
um some advantages and disadvantages and

1782
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,780
you know we need to find the right

1783
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:16,260
trade-off handle privacy concerns and

1784
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,140
make sure that there's a fair way to get

1785
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,900
this information but I think what we're

1786
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,640
finding is that this information would

1787
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,000
be very helpful and we're looking for

1788
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,020
how we can handle this in ITF I mean

1789
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,540
this is obviously over the n6 or the IP

1790
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,540
network to the 3gp Network and so this

1791
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:39,300
is this is what we're looking for

1792
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,699
if we go to the next page I think I'm

1793
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:44,520
only summarizing it so

1794
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,739
um I think um

1795
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:49,320
you know I think if the problem the

1796
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,719
problem is essentially to handle those

1797
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:53,760
variations in wireless networks and get

1798
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,020
the metadata

1799
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,179
how to handle it with encrypted and

1800
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:00,420
non-encrypted media packets and how to

1801
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:03,179
transport that information

1802
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,940
welcome any comments and feedback

1803
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:09,000
thank you Joe or any comments

1804
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,600
question

1805
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,580
from Huawei do you have any quantity

1806
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:21,420
results that uh how how much increment

1807
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:24,420
can bring to the to the video query if

1808
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,719
you use this kind of advanced scheduler

1809
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:31,140
yeah no we don't have any quality I mean

1810
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,420
or qualitative information on that I

1811
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,860
mean more or less as qualitative

1812
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,320
information which is that uh

1813
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,380
the current approaches are lacking there

1814
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,199
is significant amount of work in 3gpp by

1815
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,880
various companies you know so it's a

1816
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,380
whole study that's been running for a

1817
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:49,260
year which includes the major

1818
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,420
um you know component vendors in Ryan

1819
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,940
including Huawei Nokia Erickson and

1820
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,440
others

1821
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,900
um you know so they all

1822
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,060
are engaged in the discussion and feel

1823
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,980
the need to do it and it is being

1824
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,920
addressed for RTP and srtp what we're

1825
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,500
now bringing up here is how to handle

1826
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,440
the the issue for when you have

1827
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,380
encrypted uh information and then what

1828
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,820
do you do you know you don't have this

1829
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,580
so the the the metadata that we proposed

1830
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:20,100
here is what has been identified in the

1831
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,679
study it's not what we've come up with

1832
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:25,860
that metadata uh it's how to handle the

1833
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,020
it for encrypted packets

1834
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:30,600
you know yeah I think the problem is

1835
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,840
valid and I think it may also apply to

1836
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,739
the fixed Network lots of not awareness

1837
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:41,760
and and I think a general mechanism for

1838
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,159
this kind of metadata exposing is really

1839
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,739
useful regardless of the transport

1840
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:50,640
protocol or proxy or not or or all kinds

1841
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,500
of mechanism yeah thank you

1842
01:24:55,219 --> 01:24:58,320
I think just to comment on this I think

1843
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,540
one of the reasons why we are bringing

1844
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:03,719
this here is I think 3gp is you know

1845
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:05,820
doing their study in the xrm study

1846
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,340
that's very specific to their access

1847
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:09,480
bringing it here I think we can

1848
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,400
potentially apply to other radio

1849
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,040
Technologies and maybe even non-radio

1850
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,480
Technologies I think potentially let's

1851
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:18,179
say there's a DOCSIS transport right if

1852
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,940
it sends this metadata maybe on the

1853
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,040
scheduler maybe how we manage use this

1854
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,940
information

1855
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:25,739
maybe we can improve the system I think

1856
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:27,900
that's a theory that's a thesis

1857
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,880
so any feedback would you appreciated

1858
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,679
yeah

1859
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,420
yeah Lorenzo clearly I think all of this

1860
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,820
stuff is as I I think that the kind of

1861
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:37,140
the point is that all of this stuff is

1862
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,620
encrypted and

1863
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,900
you know if if you're proposing that the

1864
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,540
encryption be made more leaky then you

1865
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,300
may have like a sort of an uphill battle

1866
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,100
um at least depending on who's doing the

1867
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,140
encryption right

1868
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,640
um

1869
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,900
you know

1870
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,760
you've definitely seen people like

1871
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,320
Netflix get into fights with people like

1872
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,080
Comcast about you know

1873
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,880
who should drop who's packets and so on

1874
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,940
and who should pay home so I'm kind of

1875
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,500
wondering whether

1876
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,780
you it seems like you ruled out anything

1877
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,360
that acts at the IP layer but you know

1878
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,840
the SCP bits or something like ecn like

1879
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,360
moving Easy Like Making specifying ecn

1880
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,920
for quick all of that stuff seems like

1881
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,000
it's uh

1882
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,400
a much easier cell because it's outside

1883
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,860
the encryption so right

1884
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,080
um I agree that there's there's clearly

1885
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,179
a problem with how to establish the

1886
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:32,639
trust between the yeah that's something

1887
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,400
that we have to handle uh what we we

1888
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,639
find that the l4s and other ecn can help

1889
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,460
but not to the extent so we need to find

1890
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,679
maybe this is something we need to

1891
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,659
explore and uh to answer Lawrence's

1892
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,400
question in a little more detail maybe

1893
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,580
we can have the application server

1894
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:53,340
provide the specific metadata in such a

1895
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,760
way that it is not leaky

1896
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,320
um you know and that may be the

1897
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,179
challenge I mean what is it willing to

1898
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:02,040
disclose I think that's a key part of

1899
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,560
something they'll have to

1900
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,420
do yeah I know just I think uh to

1901
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,420
Lorenzo's comment I think

1902
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:11,760
is somebody in you know with this matter

1903
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,440
at all will they be able to correlate

1904
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,000
the flow will they be able to identify

1905
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,500
the type of flow I think that's a

1906
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,239
question all we are saying is it's an

1907
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,780
iframe or a p b frame or a p frame what

1908
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:23,460
can one possibly do with that

1909
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,840
information

1910
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,820
close quality to be bad

1911
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:29,880
if you want to if there's somebody but

1912
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,040
is that from privacy point of views and

1913
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,340
impact

1914
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:40,260
but I think that that's the point right

1915
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,940
you don't need to establish that trust

1916
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,400
to use something like this

1917
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,620
the ACP semantics may not be sufficient

1918
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,219
but yeah yeah with tacp we this is one

1919
01:27:50,219 --> 01:27:53,100
of the options that 3gp has proposed but

1920
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,020
the trouble is that now the iframes will

1921
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,139
go over one DHCP and maybe the others

1922
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,840
will go over another dsap which exposes

1923
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,179
the same amount of information really

1924
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:05,159
so if somebody is monitoring so you're

1925
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:07,020
exposing really that information with

1926
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,239
with a lot of additional complexity that

1927
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:11,280
comes in so in terms of the information

1928
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,699
there's nothing more really but

1929
01:28:14,699 --> 01:28:18,019
that's changing

1930
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,580
this is uh legitimate legitimate problem

1931
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,000
for sure

1932
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,100
but if you since you keep talking about

1933
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:32,040
the 5G system as the example here

1934
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,040
so I try to understand one thing you

1935
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,560
have all the metadata is important

1936
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,560
and then you think okay suppose you may

1937
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,960
face some challenge about encryption so

1938
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,360
encryption for the data player and you

1939
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,760
have a metadata the information about

1940
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,080
your metadata has to be provisioned to

1941
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,840
the 5G system

1942
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,620
so even after that we'll still be

1943
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,420
uh we used to be fixing the challenge

1944
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,639
about the encryption

1945
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,460
the first the second one here is like

1946
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,280
you have the other kind of metadata and

1947
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,380
then this information has to be some

1948
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,440
sort of converted and we provisioned

1949
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,800
into the 5G system

1950
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,900
right so

1951
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,199
this is legitimate but I'm thinking how

1952
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:24,420
in the background of 5G how I'm going to

1953
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:27,420
apply this one okay so let me take that

1954
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,580
second part first yeah and say that in

1955
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,920
the 5G there's already specific I mean

1956
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,020
not specification but studies that have

1957
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:37,380
reaching conclusion on how to transport

1958
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,320
that information from the UPF to the

1959
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,679
radio side so that's essentially why

1960
01:29:42,679 --> 01:29:45,480
extensions to either the GTP or header

1961
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,719
or by using multiple QRS flows so that

1962
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,460
part is being handled it's specific to

1963
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,800
3gpp and that's why I did not bring it

1964
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,260
here but it is being proposed and there

1965
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,239
are two models currently in contention

1966
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:59,280
you know and one of them will be picked

1967
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,480
but both will provide the 3gpp radio

1968
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,760
with how to qualify you know which flow

1969
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,620
is more important than to prioritize the

1970
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,380
drops and so on for the RTP and srtp

1971
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:13,199
cases but now when we come to as we go

1972
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,760
forward we've got to look at this

1973
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,219
encrypt report which is which is what

1974
01:30:17,219 --> 01:30:19,020
we're looking at here and you had a

1975
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,639
question on that which I may have missed

1976
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,880
me yes

1977
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,760
talking about the encryption so I'm your

1978
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,100
GDP and if you look at the you have the

1979
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:33,480
IP udb GDP and then beyond it in the

1980
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,420
control plan data has been encrypted

1981
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,080
so like uh I forget a lot of information

1982
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,179
but like iframe P from B frame and those

1983
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:43,320
type of things

1984
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,719
you may be able to send the RTP

1985
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:48,540
extension header to know some sort of

1986
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,880
information discount ability importance

1987
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,760
are you not be able to look at which one

1988
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,000
is more important I or less important P

1989
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,080
or B other kind of things right

1990
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,760
actually we don't want to be able to

1991
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,040
decode all of that so essentially there

1992
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,719
the scheduler needs very little

1993
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:08,820
information so what you mentioned really

1994
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:12,420
is it discardable or is it independent

1995
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:14,880
um or is it not one of those you know so

1996
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,760
based on that that that's really the

1997
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,320
basic information and that importance

1998
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,900
really so that's which is already there

1999
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:25,139
in the RTP headers now I mean srtp

2000
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:28,020
header extension structure so that's the

2001
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,520
kind of information we want and also

2002
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,139
where it starts and where it ends

2003
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:32,520
because we don't want to drop in between

2004
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,920
so all of that is already there and the

2005
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,960
RTP headers now

2006
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,980
and uh if that is available in some way

2007
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,480
for

2008
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:46,080
uh you know the yeah okay we can discuss

2009
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,420
that if you do go we can discard next

2010
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,719
week

2011
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,120
thank you

2012
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,340
Lorenzo I'm not sure if the key was

2013
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,260
already closed but I I just wanted to

2014
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,179
point out that you also have a

2015
01:32:00,179 --> 01:32:01,800
completeness of information problem here

2016
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,080
because the people who have the qoe

2017
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,480
metrics are the people are the people in

2018
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,360
the server and so they are going to be

2019
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,280
the ones experimenting with how to Mark

2020
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,440
these bits if you give those bits

2021
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,420
semantics you're kind of taking away the

2022
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:18,420
ability to of those folks to ex you know

2023
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,100
experiment with what works best for

2024
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,659
their users right so they may want

2025
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:23,280
something that is like kind of

2026
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,440
deliberately vague like the SCP or ecn

2027
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,580
or whatever it is that we want to

2028
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,440
specify so that they can actually figure

2029
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,699
out

2030
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:31,860
um you know look you optimize for those

2031
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:34,620
metrics Lauren so can I follow up and

2032
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,659
ask if um

2033
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:38,580
if that would be something that

2034
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:41,100
application mean we really realize that

2035
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,320
applications should be in control of

2036
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,060
this whole process as to what is

2037
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,040
important or not and so on

2038
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,500
so I wonder if I mean without the

2039
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:53,820
applications trust and its needs

2040
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:55,620
you know in conjunction with other

2041
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,420
control plane mechanisms you know like

2042
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:59,400
ecn and so on that's that would be what

2043
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,960
is needed but I wonder if there's a way

2044
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,460
that we can work that out please

2045
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,840
continue yeah you do have to talk to

2046
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,980
them yeah it's not sorry

2047
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,360
yeah this is a quick update on the I

2048
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,340
presented this on the cryptographically

2049
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,080
generated device identifies on the

2050
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,139
previous ietf just a quick follow-up on

2051
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:21,000
this and next slide please

2052
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,239
foreign

2053
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:27,120
so I think the key thing that what we

2054
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,040
are trying to do is like you know can we

2055
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,500
uh bring a like you know how we have an

2056
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,219
an AI into gpp in IET of what you have

2057
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:37,679
standardized now is a user identifier

2058
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,540
right if you look at Network accent it's

2059
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:41,880
an identifier used by the access network

2060
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,940
now in the same manner and fashion can

2061
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:48,239
we bring a structure and some semantics

2062
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,159
for device identification

2063
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,620
I think that's the The Proposal like uh

2064
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,800
if you look at the

2065
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,719
4281 right I think uh yeah that's the

2066
01:33:57,719 --> 01:34:00,060
one uh in along the same lines next

2067
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,159
slide please

2068
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:05,580
so let's talk about the use cases today

2069
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:07,739
if you look at the identifiers that are

2070
01:34:07,739 --> 01:34:09,179
present on the device

2071
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:11,699
there is a on the interface level you

2072
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:14,580
have a MAC address yeah

2073
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,860
at a device level you have a serial

2074
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:20,820
number or IMEI or Pei in the 5G system

2075
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,219
or on the cellular subscription point of

2076
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:25,500
view there's a MC or

2077
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,860
but the question is which one can be

2078
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:31,260
used as a device identifier I think

2079
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:34,320
that's the semantic that is missing so

2080
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,780
you clearly are use cases where you know

2081
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,760
we need to come out with a format and

2082
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,219
structure that is one thing and also I

2083
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:42,420
think we want to bring in some

2084
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,280
cryptographic relation because I think

2085
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,800
uh there's some threat related issues

2086
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,719
around that so next slide please

2087
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:53,940
yeah oh

2088
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:56,839
I think if you look

2089
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,880
typically in Enterprise aha my

2090
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,980
Enterprise now I

2091
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,920
and case one

2092
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,960
or even bringing two devices an iPhone

2093
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,900
and iPad but if the identity is the same

2094
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:13,020
now how can the access network you know

2095
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:15,719
apply any device specific policies

2096
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:17,580
I think that's the semantic that is

2097
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,980
missing right earlier it there was an

2098
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,900
extensive use of Mac addresses but with

2099
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:24,960
RCM with Mac randomization you don't

2100
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,179
have that identifier anymore right so

2101
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,340
now the question is you know what is the

2102
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,460
alternative to that the other use cases

2103
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,460
let's say Enterprise has both 5G and

2104
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:38,940
Wi-Fi I can do in handles now if I bring

2105
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,260
in two devices

2106
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:42,600
how does the device know that yeah it's

2107
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,000
a still the same user my identity is the

2108
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,380
same I'm using the same identity

2109
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,480
credentials but what is my device

2110
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,980
identifier so that the network can

2111
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,260
perform whatever handovers or permit the

2112
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:53,940
Handover or do session continuity thing

2113
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,600
right so again we need some semantic for

2114
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,219
device identification next slide please

2115
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,820
another

2116
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:08,820
rules I think you know yeah you know

2117
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:10,560
let's assume we use some stable

2118
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,540
identifier with some somehow let's say

2119
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:15,420
we use IMEI as a stable antifa but the

2120
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:18,480
thing is with the gdpr rules now I I

2121
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,340
don't want to expose the same identifier

2122
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,560
in every Network right potentially

2123
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,840
because somebody can do traceability so

2124
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,060
now the question is can we come out with

2125
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:29,580
this structure and semantics where the

2126
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,620
antifa has a relation to the access

2127
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,940
network

2128
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,400
next next slide please

2129
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,460
so I think the proposal here is coming

2130
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,860
out with a structure and semantics where

2131
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:43,260
the device amplifier is generated based

2132
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,659
on some cryptographic terms right maybe

2133
01:36:45,659 --> 01:36:47,300
there's a public key private key pair

2134
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,560
and we use some Access Network

2135
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:51,900
identifier and some auxiliary parameters

2136
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,520
based on that kind of commodity the

2137
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,980
structure that way the identifier is a

2138
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:58,920
binding to the access network that is uh

2139
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,440
that way when I present that identifier

2140
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,060
to the network network knows yes you

2141
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,280
know I'm able to I know that this

2142
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,620
identifier is for this network and I can

2143
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:10,199
identify the device so this is uh you

2144
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:13,679
know the thinking here uh one I think I

2145
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,420
see applicability potentially may be

2146
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:18,120
useful in many environments uh one more

2147
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,559
slide and we close it yeah

2148
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,060
yeah I think uh the identifier

2149
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:26,280
generation how we generate and the what

2150
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,840
are the elements that we use for the

2151
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,420
identifier construction and finally we

2152
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:33,780
should be able to Signal this in radius

2153
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,580
and E extensions and other things all

2154
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:38,460
right we Define some identifier uh for

2155
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:41,340
that some attribute to radius attribute

2156
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,860
these are the the thinking here next

2157
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:47,420
Slide the last slide potentially

2158
01:37:47,699 --> 01:37:49,320
it's like please

2159
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,639
yeah

2160
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,340
yeah and how the network validates the

2161
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,199
Enterprise I think you know that also I

2162
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:58,679
talked about it uh so I'm trying to see

2163
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:01,500
if you can publish some uh document here

2164
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,980
along the lines of uh now document

2165
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,440
so any questions comments yeah that's

2166
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,280
all yeah

2167
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,580
thank you any comment

2168
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,260
question

2169
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,420
clarification

2170
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,340
yeah if there's any feedback happy to

2171
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:26,600
take it but yeah otherwise yeah

2172
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:31,860
yeah thank you

2173
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,960
um yeah it's more it's just a question

2174
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,639
time to time you need the device

2175
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:37,980
identifier to be able to perform some

2176
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:40,260
configuration update and so on so in

2177
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,460
that case

2178
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:44,520
if you are using uh something that will

2179
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,460
be encrypted encrypted so how you will

2180
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:50,699
time to time you will have to

2181
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:53,699
they encrypted or uh so so the

2182
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:55,800
identifier is generated based on some

2183
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,780
cryptographic key pairs I think that's

2184
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,120
one thing but the access network will be

2185
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,520
able to uh you know access network has

2186
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,620
The the device identifier right it's

2187
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,139
able to decode that I think it's a see

2188
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:09,420
the key thing is the endpoint can assert

2189
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:11,460
that I am the owner of the Dos amplifier

2190
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:13,199
because of the private key associated

2191
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:15,420
with that and the network can value it

2192
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,580
yes you are the true owner of that

2193
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:19,920
currently if I in the IMEI if I signal

2194
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,860
I'm IMEI some other device signals IMEI

2195
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:24,659
there is no way to validate for the

2196
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:25,920
network to say yeah you're the true

2197
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:28,800
owner of the IMEI I think this is Miss

2198
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,780
you know fixes that scenario so yeah so

2199
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:32,460
it will be only between the device and

2200
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:36,080
the network access yeah

2201
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:41,219
how about the Supreme those type of

2202
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:43,260
things and then that have been allocated

2203
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:46,020
by the operator to the UE those

2204
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,120
substance I haven't seen you mentioning

2205
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,280
here a super you said yeah yeah yeah

2206
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,080
yeah

2207
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:55,560
see Sufi is a subscription uh identifier

2208
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:58,440
right now the question is if I my device

2209
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,120
has both the radio Technologies Wi-Fi

2210
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,659
and private 5G

2211
01:40:02,659 --> 01:40:05,520
that I can use on the Wi-Fi link or

2212
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,960
something else I think that's a question

2213
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,659
right super is so very much specific to

2214
01:40:09,659 --> 01:40:13,500
the this uh the SIM card right so yeah

2215
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,840
that's why something a independent of

2216
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,699
one layer above might be the right thing

2217
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:19,380
yeah

2218
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:22,380
yeah so so super is more related to the

2219
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:25,020
user and here so from the mobile point

2220
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,639
of view it will be the IMEI and actually

2221
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,219
for sap we have already a solution to be

2222
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:31,560
able to encrypt this one yeah

2223
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,840
yeah exactly the soupy to Suki is

2224
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,860
already there right yeah

2225
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,420
yeah okay thank you thank you

2226
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,900
so next one Jeffrey

2227
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,860
right so this is a presentation I didn't

2228
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:55,500
get to do last time because a glitch in

2229
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,239
uploading the slides

2230
01:40:57,239 --> 01:41:00,199
looks like this

2231
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,639
the use case actually started here

2232
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:07,620
um about mobile user print

2233
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:09,300
Transportation

2234
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:13,860
um so in 5G between the CU or genob and

2235
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:18,540
the UPF there is this gdpu tunneling um

2236
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:22,560
in Street Harmony that is over an IP VPN

2237
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,520
we refer to that one as N3 VPN in this

2238
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,420
document

2239
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:30,719
we the ipvp is used so that a converged

2240
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,520
transport infrastructure can be useful

2241
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:35,760
both entry and all kinds of other

2242
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,460
transportations so I have a picture here

2243
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,880
we have the

2244
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:46,020
n3brfs on the PES for the N3 VPN the

2245
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:49,619
genobes are kind of like a host in the

2246
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:53,520
in the connecting to the vrfs the genobi

2247
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,760
is put on the GDP header UDP header mpv6

2248
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,780
header and gets to the n3brf and then

2249
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,639
depending on whether the transport is

2250
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,060
mpospace or srb6 based we put on a label

2251
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:09,540
stack or srv6 header uh plus the

2252
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,699
original Ip header UDP header and GTP

2253
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:15,360
GDP header okay so the other end and the

2254
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,239
PE D removes the label stack or srv6

2255
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,820
header you you get the IP basically or

2256
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:22,679
UDP header and GDP header Panic as the

2257
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:25,860
UPF that's how traditionally it works

2258
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:28,820
next slide please

2259
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:33,020
so this is what we call the mpos or srv6

2260
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:36,239
transporting GTP

2261
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:39,020
um the drafts srv6 mobile user print

2262
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:43,199
that draft is basically replacing GDP

2263
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:47,639
with srv6 and based on the M4 N2 signal

2264
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:50,580
signal GDP parameters that is under the

2265
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,739
hood does not require certificate

2266
01:42:52,739 --> 01:42:55,980
changes and that replacement could be

2267
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:58,020
between the network functions like

2268
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:01,380
between genob and UPF or it could be

2269
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,420
just between the gateways attached to

2270
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,719
those functions in in the Gateway case

2271
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:11,060
the N3 VPN PE is are natural gateways

2272
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:16,380
to do that so the GP traffic is restruct

2273
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:21,000
reconstructed by the n3p vpnps so the

2274
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,380
The Source PE replace that IP basic UDP

2275
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:28,800
and GDP header with the srv6 header or

2276
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,659
vice versa

2277
01:43:30,659 --> 01:43:33,659
um this is a acceptable and preferred by

2278
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:37,619
some operators and they they like they

2279
01:43:37,619 --> 01:43:39,420
accept this because all the elements are

2280
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:41,699
under their own control so they are fine

2281
01:43:41,699 --> 01:43:42,960
with doing that

2282
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,659
and the advantage of this is that you

2283
01:43:45,659 --> 01:43:47,219
get the traffic against steering

2284
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:48,300
cavities

2285
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:52,139
um uh for SRT or sfc purposes and you

2286
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:54,420
also get bandwidth savings because you

2287
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,159
no longer need the IPv6 header your

2288
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:59,360
depend or HTTP header anymore

2289
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:04,980
just a clarifying question so I guess

2290
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:07,020
this explains how the routing aspects

2291
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:08,040
the

2292
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,440
all the aspects that are carried in the

2293
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,440
GTP signaling like cures aspects and so

2294
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,540
on are covered I mean I suppose yeah

2295
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:19,500
this is the basic what uh that the iitf

2296
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,659
last core draft is about right so I'm

2297
01:44:21,659 --> 01:44:23,699
just explaining it yeah

2298
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:27,480
so this is about a service is replacing

2299
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:31,020
GDP and as I show in this picture I want

2300
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,719
to point out another option for The npos

2301
01:44:33,719 --> 01:44:37,020
Operators if you're not using srb6 and

2302
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:39,540
if you want to continue to use mpis you

2303
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,159
can do similar things

2304
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:47,239
so here you replace that uh

2305
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:51,300
srv6 header with the MPS label stack oh

2306
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:56,960
that's all you still get a SRT sfsa

2307
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,840
is a benefit that srv6 replacing GDP

2308
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,179
gives you Additionally you can get even

2309
01:45:03,179 --> 01:45:05,520
more bandwidth savings because

2310
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,440
you only need a simple label stack

2311
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,860
instead of the entire SRS Etc

2312
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:15,260
so that's basically mpos replacing GDP

2313
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:18,659
essentially this is a pseudo wire

2314
01:45:18,659 --> 01:45:23,340
between the genobi CU and UPF and that

2315
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:26,219
only transport the payload

2316
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:29,420
of that uh

2317
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:32,580
just a

2318
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:35,639
GDP payload basically yeah so

2319
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:39,960
um in the srb6 replacing GDP case the

2320
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:44,280
tid and other gdpu parameters are put

2321
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,860
into the srb6 header but it was in the

2322
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:51,179
MPS replacing GDP case we leave the GTP

2323
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:55,020
header in place we just replace the IPv6

2324
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,960
header and UDP header with the NTS level

2325
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,159
stack

2326
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:03,119
next slide so that's the basic idea it

2327
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,520
was originally written here as a pseudo

2328
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,639
wire draft but then we generalize it to

2329
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,420
the entire ipvpn

2330
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:14,340
there are a lot of details in the draft

2331
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,800
about the signaling but I'm going to

2332
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,860
skip it here I just want to mention this

2333
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:24,199
option of replacing GDP

2334
01:46:24,199 --> 01:46:27,060
tunneling under the hood

2335
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:31,020
with mpos similar to using srv6 to

2336
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:35,340
replace that again it's under the hood

2337
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:38,159
I think I'm just going to stop here skip

2338
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:41,179
the rest of the slides

2339
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,100
thank you Jeffrey any questions comments

2340
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,380
on this yeah please uh

2341
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:51,659
[Music]

2342
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:55,320
no matter what replace GTP with either

2343
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,719
srv6 or mpis

2344
01:46:57,719 --> 01:47:01,020
uh I haven't read your your draft yet

2345
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:03,900
how about those like uh the IE

2346
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:06,540
information element that embedded in the

2347
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:09,480
GDP like a pdu session container for the

2348
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,860
QX flow all kind of information

2349
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:13,080
regarding you know don't be carried

2350
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:16,560
within the beyond the GDP header thank

2351
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,340
you in the MPS case the GTP header is

2352
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:23,400
capped and GDP payload is kept so

2353
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:26,940
nothing changes in srv6 I believe most

2354
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:30,600
of the parameters are

2355
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,239
placed into the srv6 there so it should

2356
01:47:33,239 --> 01:47:35,100
be fine but I don't know the details

2357
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,239
there

2358
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:37,800
okay

2359
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,719
state your name please hello Jim

2360
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:42,119
Costello from BT

2361
01:47:42,119 --> 01:47:44,219
um could I ask if you've had a liaison

2362
01:47:44,219 --> 01:47:47,219
statements exchange with 3gpp the CT

2363
01:47:47,219 --> 01:47:48,960
groups at all

2364
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,780
um so I use the word under the hood

2365
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:55,199
several times so basically there is no

2366
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:58,320
change to 3gb architecture or signaling

2367
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,900
we are still doing this based on the N2

2368
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,840
and M4 signaling so

2369
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,920
it because of that I didn't think we

2370
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,060
needed a a liaison because this is all

2371
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,520
under the hood so it's just the operator

2372
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,699
deployment choice

2373
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:20,520
okay thank you

2374
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,580
okay last question yeah I have a

2375
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,199
follow-up question regarding the the

2376
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,900
lesson part uh you keep Imaging about

2377
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,420
the uh the end of the hood the the

2378
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,580
underlying part is like transparency to

2379
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,199
the up linear here

2380
01:48:34,199 --> 01:48:36,719
uh regarding the GDP

2381
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:39,780
I'm thinking uh for the ti department is

2382
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:42,480
okay how about the the end uh the end

2383
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:45,659
device no the IP for the the both ends

2384
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:47,940
for those things are you going to embed

2385
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:52,199
it in your like srv6 header or MPS label

2386
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:55,260
those type of images that you go through

2387
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,960
the control play you get them from SMF

2388
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,460
EMF those type of things and then

2389
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:03,179
program into slv6 mpos those type of

2390
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:05,639
scenes right N2 and M4 sequence still

2391
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:07,500
happens as is

2392
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:10,500
that's the key yeah so in that case so

2393
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,719
what is the difference here you just run

2394
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:17,940
IP UDP GDP with the underlay srv6

2395
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:21,900
uh right so you can either do uh Sr

2396
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:25,199
visible MPS transport GDP or you can do

2397
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:29,219
srv6 replacing GDP or mpos replacing GDP

2398
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:32,280
or under the hood yeah exactly but the

2399
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,860
what is the you know because you have to

2400
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,860
do the mapping here you have the the Qs

2401
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,440
flows those type of things through sdap

2402
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,960
on gnode for the Uplink for the downlink

2403
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,360
you have the things originally the UPF

2404
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,239
will do the in-cap for the GTP now you

2405
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,520
have to add additional functions and

2406
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:53,699
also is necessary or not but you have to

2407
01:49:53,699 --> 01:49:55,880
add those things in order to in

2408
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:59,100
incorporate these things inside if the

2409
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:02,400
genome beside or the UPF side even in

2410
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,040
the original s36 or mposite transport

2411
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:08,040
GDP case you still need to translate

2412
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:13,080
that uh across things into the uh IP or

2413
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:15,300
mpos request mechanism in the underlying

2414
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,880
Network that part no matter what it

2415
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:20,060
needs to happen how about I.E the the

2416
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:22,800
DPI information element all kinds of

2417
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,619
things that have been defined in 3gpp is

2418
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:29,400
transparent it's uh if if it needs the

2419
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,619
underlay work to do something

2420
01:50:31,619 --> 01:50:33,900
that part will still happen Okay well

2421
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,460
anyway but still back to my original

2422
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:37,500
question like so in that case why you

2423
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,719
want to add another things Beyond

2424
01:50:39,719 --> 01:50:41,639
already existed adding another thing

2425
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:42,719
it's uh

2426
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:47,760
really let's um yeah I think so thank

2427
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,179
you so much

2428
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:52,679
yeah okay all right

2429
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:55,159
I think this was our last presentation

2430
01:50:55,159 --> 01:50:59,460
uh this uh that's all we close the

2431
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:04,280
meeting here thank you so much excuse me

2432
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,719
that's good

2433
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,500
thank you

2434
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:24,799
you're getting recorded

2435
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:30,369
[Music]

2436
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:11,280
okay

2437
01:52:20,659 --> 01:52:23,400
over there

2438
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:25,940
okay
