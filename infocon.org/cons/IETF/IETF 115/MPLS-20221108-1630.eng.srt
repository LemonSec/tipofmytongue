14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,920

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,980
Lower for you or shall I continue

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,080

this uh this Errata we have an Errata

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,879
that was reported against

51
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,519
um RFC 8960

52
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
um I as one of the uh co-authors of this

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,300
draft

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,019
um we acknowledge this is a uh a Miss in

55
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,860
the RFC and the the the the suggestion

56
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,099
um will work so we will be following up

57
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,879
uh with uh with the ad on uh closing

58
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,440
this matter

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,080
um it seems that there is a duplicate

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,580
errata

61
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,739
um on this and we will look into that

62
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,440
okay do you want me to continue Nick on

63
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,099
uh yes yeah

64
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,599
okay sure

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,140
um so in terms of uh Liaisons we have

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,599
none uh egressing from mpls working

67
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,280
group we have one that came in uh back

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,580
in March and uh it came to multiple

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,980
working groups and we will be uh looking

70
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,200
looking into that

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,560
um there was a session uh today

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,080
um maybe not in the slides but about the

73
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,739
network slicing uh identity

74
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,640
um

75
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,060
um it was with liaison with three gpp I

76
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,700
could not attend remotely but not sure

77
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,060
if Loa or Nick have you attended

78
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,340
um I had the same problem so I think we

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,860
have to check afterwards that was today

80
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,099
at around noon I guess the session yeah

81
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,860
it was earlier today but we could not

82
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,360
log in so that's one thing on that Navy

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,920
will provide an update to the working

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,699
group uh on subsequent maybe

85
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,100
um subsequent sessions or via email

86
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,320

88
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,840
we thank all the working group members

um you know um uh to become rfcs

94
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,740
we have one document in iesg and uh

95
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,520
and we recently adopted a uh a document

96
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,620
that's on the agenda today

97
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,720
this is the MSD yang

98
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,040
[Music]

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,540
document

100
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,280
next slide please

101
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,919
so in terms of the existing working

102
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,639
group documents uh uh the first one here

103
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,340
egress tlv nilfac

104
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,680
um the the early Court allocation

105
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,500
expired and we had to renew that

106
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,820
um we have a couple of m e documents uh

107
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,100
that are listed here their existing mpls

108
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,560
documents but we will talk about them in

109
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,039
more details in the joint session

110
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,220
um we are missing couple of uh reports

111
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,580
on some of the documents that you don't

112
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,000
have note next to them so hopefully the

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,520
authors are present and they can provide

114
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,259
the chairs with an update later on

115
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,720
um the the we have we have the RFC 6374

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,080
Sr document the authors have declared

117
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,360
this is stable and ready for working

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,699
group last call the chairs were recorded

119
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,240
this and we'll take the next steps uh as

120
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,620
needed

121
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,100
um the next one below it as well

122
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,840
srep-o-am is a candidate for working

123
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,419
group last call

124
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,840
and uh the last one here there was a

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,880
mpls BFD directed

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,699
um there was a upload a new revision

127
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,819
that was posted and in it they changed

128
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,759
the status to experimental

129
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,220
um and the plan is to progress less the

130
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,620
working group last call

131
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,580
um

132
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,940
I um we have one also that's ready for

133
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,919
working working group last call which is

134
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,039
the ri RSVP frr

135
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,039
and uh

136
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,139
just to let the working group know that

137
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,139
we are tracking these

138
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,080
okay so next slide please so in terms of

139
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,259
individual documents a couple of them

140
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,419
are on the agenda either on this session

141
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,180
or the joint session I will not go into

142
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,960
details of each one of them

143
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,080
um so maybe we'll skip the update to

144
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,479
individual ones

145
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,620
next slide please

146
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,419
next

147
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,360
okay so this is the mpls working group

148
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,120
session and I wanted to bring up the

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,580
that you know we have a design team

150
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,539
that's been working on uh M A and M A

151
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,500
solution uh um

152
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,639
activities and we we wanted to um uh

153
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,919
bring to your attention that uh we were

154
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,680
weekly meeting to discuss uh M A

155
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,620
activities and we may need to revisit

156
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,000
the frequency and

157
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,840
um the the recurrence of the meetings uh

158
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
so this is something that's up uh for

159
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,960
for the members to discuss uh there was

160
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,840
the recent uh topic that brought uh that

161
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,720
was brought up uh and um in terms of

162
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,780
non-ipp loads and the interactions with

163
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,599
M A packets

164
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,300
um so that's something that the design

165
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,360
team will have to look at and

166
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,539
um you know we will we'll see if we we

167
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,660
will keep the the the periodic meeting

168
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,139
and the same frequency

169
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,000
uh so that with that

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,339
um that you know I will close and I'm

183
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,480

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,040
okay thank you so uh this is a an update

185
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,740
to the working group on uh Wiki

186
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,220
migration that's happening in ietf

187
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,940
um

188
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,480
uh it's informative plus some actions

189
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,720
that um you know we're asking either the

190
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,560
the members or the chairs will take on

191
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,440
so let me start with the plan on the

192
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,180
next slide and we'll go through the

193
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,920
actions after

194
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,440
so there is a new uh there there is

195
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,620
there are plans to migrate from the old

196
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,540
um uh Wiki to a new Wiki and uh the plan

197
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,880
is to uh turn off the old Wiki uh that's

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,760
tracked on

199
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,620
track.ietf.org sometime in November

200
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,940
right after IDF 115.

201
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,420
and um

202
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,480
so that the uh you know we we don't

203
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,600
users or visitors are looking for uh

204
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,959
content don't hit any stale content or

205
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,700
the search engines don't reveal

206
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,480
information that's not up to date so uh

207
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,880
they we will not keep two copies of the

208
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,980
information and the old copy will will

209
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,980
disconnect from the web

210
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,720
um

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,680
uh all content that that's that was on

212
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,560
the old Wiki will continue to live and

213
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,459
and it will be archived uh but pulling

214
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,079
it out will not be a straightforward

215
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,300
process there's a Docker image that

216
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,880
people would have to download and and

217
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,420
run on their machine to extract it

218
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,519
so in terms of actions for the working

219
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,519
group we want we need to migrate

220
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,600
anything that's so valuable uh value to

221
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,180
the working group to the new Wiki

222
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,700
um we already have a new Wiki with

223
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,640
minimal content on it

224
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,180
um I think the lower Hutt set it up but

225
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,920
we will need to populate it with the

226
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,500
relevant content there is a guide to

227
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,260
individuals contributing to Wiki it's uh

228
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,839
it's a very well documented guide so I

229
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,440
encourage people to go through it

230
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,779
people can directly edit the page or use

231
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:34,940
git

232
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,920
to commit the changes

233
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,279
there's also a zulip channel that's was

234
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,579
set up for helping raising questions and

235
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,660
discussions

236
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,000
and there's a support email as well that

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,640
people want to use use it for

238
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,640
if they run into issues

239
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,240
next slide please so the ask for from

240
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,200
the working group is for volunteers if

241
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,220
you can to help in sorry

242
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,440
to help in migrating the content from

243
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,620
the old Wiki to the new Wiki so we will

244
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,720
be doing that there you know as as much

245
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,480
as possible but this will be a uh you

246
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,459
know we have a limited time to migrate

247
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,240
as much as possible before uh the wiki

248
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,940
will the old Wiki will be turned off

249
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,480
uh so and in terms of using the wikis

250
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,440
for

251
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,680
um meetings that we do as well as

252
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,880
tracking

253
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,519
um updates to documents we will have to

254
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
use the new Wiki from now and on

255
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,820
so that's uh that's about it it was a

256
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,420
heads up on migrating uh our wikis to

257
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,360
the new uh placeholder

258
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,200
um

259
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,660
so I hope people are aware of it now

260
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,940
I think that was the last slide on this

261
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,880
and I'm happy to answer any questions if

262
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,139
people

263
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,800
have any

264
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,060
none no questions

265
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,219
okay thank you thank you

266
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,959
so next

267
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,540
is MSD young update

268
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,839
um hello everyone my name is I'm going

269
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,200
to present an update uh of the young

270
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,040
data model for mprs MSD on behalf of all

271
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,600
the co-authors

272
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,760
next slide please

273
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,639
so on this draft has recently been

274
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,720
adopted as a working group document

275
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,720
um so just a bit history

276
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,760
um

277
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,079
MSD stands for maximal say depths and is

278
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,320
defined in RFC 8476 and 8491 so this

279
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,139
data model was originally part of the

280
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,779
segment routing data model which is

281
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,940
already published as RFC 1920.

282
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,260
and it was suggested by the ISC during

283
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,079
the last call to separate this part from

284
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,940
the segment routing data model because

285
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,459
it's part of a small mprs

286
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,740
characteristics

287
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,820
um this model augmented the base

288
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,579
mprs model that's defined the RFC 8960.

289
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,160
next slide please

290
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,720
so um

291
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,380
thanks for thanks careful review during

292
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,959
the adoption call so

293
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,680
um we made some editorial changes I did

294
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,920
some references also updated the

295
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,899
security

296
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,600
consideration during the adoption call

297
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,940
next slide please

298
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,360
so this page shows the trade diagram of

299
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,600
the entire data model so you can see

300
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,019
it's a very small one basically it has

301
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,500
two parts the node MSD is a list of the

302
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,120
node I must be based on iMac types also

303
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,600
the link I might see which augments the

304
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,699
mpis interface with the Lincoln MSD same

305
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,560
as node MSC is based on the MSD tags

306
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,079
um so this data model has the common

307
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,940
definition of MSD type and both the ospf

308
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,339
and the Isis

309
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:00,720
msdi extension

310
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,500
how indeed how dependency on this model

311
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,959
so we sure hope we can progress this

312
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,820
model fast

313
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,019
next slide please

314
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,620
so next step

315
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,579
um

316
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,880
because this is a really simple

317
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,860
straightforward data model and now it's

318
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,560
a working group document we hope we can

319
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,680
progress this soon and we like it to

320
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,660
request the young doctor last call

321
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,660
review and routing Direct Read last call

322
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,560
review

323
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,199
and after that we hope we can do a

324
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,380
working group last call so if anyone has

325
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,380
any comments or questions please let us

326
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,620

327
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,579
that's yes yeah any question there's one

328

can I do it

332
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,139
yeah can I do another mask reminder

333
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,040
please thank you

334
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,059

yeah

336
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,099
uh so the MSC types that are defined

337
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,339
today are not all mpls specific uh there

338
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,000
are some MSG types defined for srv6

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,099
uh how is that going to be handled uh

340
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,280
so this one so far is now considering

341
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,840
isra6 I I think israel6 has its own data

342
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,020
model so it's up to the sra6 authors to

343
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,559
to decide how to what to do with it

344
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,559
only

345
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,559
okay but the number space uh for MSD

346
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,539
types uh that you had in the previous

347
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,600
slide is common

348
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,140
uh yes there is there is

349
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,080
I suppose you can either augment this

350
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,220
one or if I can talk with the sra6 also

351
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,799
as if it's really necessary we can split

352
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,919
it into a separate and a model

353
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,919
foreign

354
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,900
yeah so I'm I'm perhaps I was I'm not

355
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,559
aware I missed that uh thing but uh

356
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,679
Sid or segment depth was Sr indeed Sr

357
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,960
specific so uh

358
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,980
yeah

359
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,960
um I'm not sure why that is

360
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,780
okay if you read the Japanese from

361
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,780
Microsoft if you read the ISS rfcs that

362
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,020
Define cmsd the language is that we

363
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,900
explicitly defined type number one which

364
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,740
is

365
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,860
in PLS specific the rest will be defined

366
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,160
in the future so for me this split

367
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,100
wasn't really obvious and that's why we

368
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,039
did it initially as kind of part of

369
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,740
common model but since working group

370
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,960
decided to split it I would assume we'll

371
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
do the same for services even so you're

372
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,900
completely right the MSD scope is larger

373
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,799
than Justin BLS

374
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,139
you are next

375
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,539
question to Ying Zen but I see she is

376
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,120
left maybe I'll take it offline then if

377
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,620
uh okay

378
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,160
all right go ahead is he back

379
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
yeah yeah

380
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,100
okay I I my question is related to what

381
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,980
ketan started to talk about and also

382
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,020
related to a comment uh that we got

383
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,299
during adoption

384
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,720
um it was a um a suggestion to go with

385
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,100
an Ayana module for documenting the MSD

386
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,980
types uh

387
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,220
rather than defining them in your module

388
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,679
um is that something that you will

389
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,039
pursue or uh what are your plans

390
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,559
I think uh just like the discussion just

391
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,200
we just had with skating is if it's

392
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,799
necessary if I start with six um

393
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,200
authors don't want to augment this

394
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,039
module then we can split it otherwise I

395
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,559
think I don't think it's really that

396
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,380
necessary to split it because

397
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,860
um I don't expect the msv type will

398
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,360
increase that much

399
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,380
yeah but yeah we can work with the sra6

400
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,720
authors together

401
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,860
um if we can progress this draft fast we

402
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,240
we are now going to cause any

403
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
dependencies for them so I think that's

404
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,260
okay

405
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,360
otherwise it's gonna be a problem might

406
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,340
take for everybody

407
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,799
yeah I I think we should not rush this

408
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,900
uh there is there is an issue here but

409
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,980
we can take it on the list

410
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,600
so the base protocol model is dependent

411
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,700
on this if we

412
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,520
expanded the interdependency will kick

413
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,179
in and I really don't again as I said I

414
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,700
don't necessarily understand why we had

415
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,220
to take it out of base model in a

416
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,559
service six we could either build single

417
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,559
models that address same as this or do

418
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,580
and follow work as we did here and have

419
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,280
MSD for a service 6 as a separate model

420
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,679
if again working group

421
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,799
you wish to do so now after the SRA 6

422
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,559
young authors

423
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,780
okay thanks any more questions or

424
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,159
comments

425
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,520
she was empty so yeah thank you thank

426
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,080
you

427
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,639
so who is next

428
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,240
it's Greg

429
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,200
yes that's correct

430
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,000
okay

431
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,720
um next slide please

432
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,880
so um what is the simple two-way active

433
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,240
measurement protocol uh uh it is a

434
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,460
performance measurement

435
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,140
um the two-way means that uh we have uh

436
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,900
uh one

437
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,299
um actor that originates test packets

438
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,220
that is

439
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,260
this actor is identified as a session

440
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,820
sender and transmitting to their um uh

441
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,299
peer session reflector session reflector

442
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,140
um

443
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,840
performs some processing on a test

444
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,059
packet and reflects it back to the

445
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,179
session sender so thus

446
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,140
um

447
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,700
uh we

448
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,780
um this protocol enables uh one way

449
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,179
um delay measurement uh it can measure

450
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,020
one-way packet to us also to detect uh

451
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,179
packet reordering and packet duplication

452
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,780
um so so far uh at uh ippm working group

453
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,600
we published uh two RCS the Baseline

454
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,700
specification RFC 8762 and extensions

455
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,100
8172 extensions include extra padding

456
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,520
direct loss measurement uh time Source

457
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,880
reporting that uh intended to help to

458
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,840
evaluate the accuracy of the timestamp

459
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,880
so to differentiate with the timestamp

460
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,059
uh acquired using the hardware

461
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:01,320
assistance uh or it's a software based

462
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,380
and follow-up Telemetry uh so this

463
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,840
particular case might be interesting for

464
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,900
a virtualized environment

465
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,840
um so that um

466
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,100
uh packet that is reflected uh in

467
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,740
virtualized environment in a server

468
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,799
um it's uh

469
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,240
using the software-based the packet so

470
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,600
if it's in and a three timestamp uh the

471
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,419
packet will experience unpredictable

472
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,059
um uh delay in queuing

473
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,799
so but many systems can report back to

474
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,059
the sender uh their actual um walk lock

475
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,799
value when the packet was physically

476
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,220
transmitted so that value uh then can be

477
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,880
used in a consecutive

478
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,900
test packet so that uh to uh get more

479
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,179
precise more accurate uh delay

480
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,179
measurement

481
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,220
um

482
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,460
so uh the mechanism is similar to Echo

483
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,340
request a reply

484
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,120
and

485
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,740
um it's

486
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,220
um format is a symmetric packet size but

487
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,340
uh with the additional using the Yang

488
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,840
based model which is uh in um

489
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,679
um working group status document uh it

490
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,799
can be modified uh to do asymmetric uh

491
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,100
measurements next slide please

492
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,419
so

493
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,380
um

494
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,919
uh the base specifications uh are not um

495
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,159
Network specific and uh in a discussion

496
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,600
at ippm working group uh so there was uh

497
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,159
brought attention and proposed the

498
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,880
mechanism uh this uses um stamp um

499
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,559
extensions

500
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,640
uh to communicate for example uh the

501
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,360
return path uh for the reflected packet

502
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,820
uh also

503
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,740
um

504
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,919
stamp supports a simplified

505
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,220
demultiplexing of uh sessions using a

506
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,320
stamp session ID

507
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,460
so

508
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,919
uh with all that uh it uh appeared that

509
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,980
uh using the approach similar to

510
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,440
bootstrapping BFD session over mpls LSP

511
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,120
uh it could be a useful option uh to use

512
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,779
and to extend lspp being to bootstrap

513
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,279
step um

514
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,960
test session

515
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,419
so in here

516
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,559
you see uh they're captured proposed

517
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,860
um format of

518
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,880
the Tov stem tlv

519
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,820
that includes

520
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,860
session identifier

521
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,260
destination port number

522
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,640
and

523
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,659
um So currently

524
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,419
um

525
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,960
stamp can use

526
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,539
UDP Port 862

527
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:21,000
but at the same time it can use a port

528
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,679
number from ephemeral range so this

529
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,200
field can be used to signal to the

530
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,960
reflector on which Port it uh should

531
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
expect a

532
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,039
test stem test packet uh from the sender

533
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,400
and optional uh extension for

534
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,779
specification of the reflected path

535
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,360
um reflected packet path so which can

536
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,899
reuse

537
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,440
um faculty of these and non-fac defined

538
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,460
in uh earlier in previous

539
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,620
extensions to lspp next slide please

540
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,799
so um

541
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,380
this is pretty simple and uh welcome

542
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,200
your comments uh questions

543
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,559
suggestions and well at some point we'll

544
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,900
ask for working group adoption

545
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,159
thank you

546
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,779
that's correct

547
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,260
solo

548
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,740
quick question I read the draft it seems

549
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,380
to be in a pretty good way are we

550
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,720
already working with adoption

551
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,380
kind of immediately

552
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,020
uh well um thank you very much Laura for

553
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,200
your consideration uh yes

554
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,059
what are you waiting for why are you not

555
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,620
why are you do you have the question

556
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,179
mark

557
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,820
on the on your slide

558
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,159
I I try to be

559
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,020
um polite humble okay

560
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,520
okay I'm not always but I'm trying no

561
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,500
this sounds like the lower has to pick

562
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,840
an action up yes

563
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,080
okay so Charlie

564
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,299
is next yeah

565
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,940
don't skim through the draft and it's a

566
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,059
good uh starting point I think I just

567
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,520
have a

568
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,720
clarification question so we have an

569
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,340
mpls we published RFC 7876 which allows

570
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,520
you to do uh uh performance monitoring

571
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,799
and measurement for with mpls with ipudp

572
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,460
um and it doesn't require bootstrapping

573
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,120
um for the session ID

574
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,159
I'm wondering if you you know can

575
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,100
highlight the advantages of this

576
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,840
approach versus what we have already

577
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,520
yeah

578
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,419
um

579
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,640
I I like their ideology of Roc 6374

580
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,240
uh because it resembles ideology of

581
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,899
ethernet OEM and uh even goes uh more

582
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,820
flexible because it allows combination

583
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,260
of

584
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,419
uh packet delay packet to us measurement

585
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,580
in one packet

586
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,039
um so

587
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,419
um

588
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,600
we've got quite a lot of interest in the

589
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,159
stamp and I'm aware of a number of

590
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,779
implementations

591
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:32,240
uh being worked on and being prototyped

592
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,500
so I believe that stamp and again

593
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,840
so let me start probably from a little

594
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,520
bit far

595
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,940
um stamp allows for uh interrupt working

596
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,000
uh with the T1 white but unfortunately

597
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,120
the state of the T1 white it's not

598
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,559
standard uh in the way it was uh defined

599
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,580
in RFC 5357 as appendix so it doesn't

600
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,260
have the standard uh

601
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,600
richness and fullness so it's not

602
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,840
fully defined so that's in my experience

603
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,539
working with the T1 polite we

604
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,460
experienced quite a lot of problems of

605
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,659
interworking with the different

606
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,480
implementations

607
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,340
so stamp is attempt

608
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,039
to bring to the industry standard-based

609
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,399
solution for the simple uh measurement

610
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,399
that allows not only

611
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,039
um

612
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,659
delay and packet to us measurement but

613
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,720
detection of reordering and packet

614
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
duplication and at the same time can

615
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,760
work together in an environment where

616
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,360
the T1 white is deployed because uh

617
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,539
their characteristics and principles of

618
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,720
stamp can allow it to interwork with the

619
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,140
T1 white in unauthenticated mode so uh

620
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,240
if you want I can go into more the

621
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,140
specifics of a stem but uh I just want

622
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,419
to mention you know really concentrate

623
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,640
on discussion of bootstrapping mechanism

624
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,779
um are you intending to use

625
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,640
um LSP ping for session maintenance as

626
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,820
well like with you cameras and that's

627
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,580
that's a great question so yes

628
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,960
um

629
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,720
um I might be not really clearly

630
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,940
articulated in this version

631
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,700
but intention is a little bit different

632
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,299
from DFD bootstrapping because in DB DVD

633
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,419
bootstrapping the assumption is that uh

634
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,360
only single uh packet with BFD

635
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,200
discriminator Tov is used

636
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,779
so uh in talking to people implementing

637
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,360
that uh the assumption is that all our

638
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,600
consecutive will be uh rejected so in

639
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,980
this case

640
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,779
um and I will clear I'll make sure it's

641
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:01,080
clear uh explicitly stated uh for the

642
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,279
same session ID there might be a number

643
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,179
of or sequence of uh

644
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,940
things that change the return path

645
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,380
because for example you want to change

646
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,559
the return path okay just make sure that

647
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,539
the the recommend making sure that the

648
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,279
text is really clear on how it should be

649
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,600
used right yes

650
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,940
um it's a good point thank you yeah

651
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,500
there were quite a few interrupt issues

652
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,760
that came up in the industry in general

653
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,640
with LS3 PFT because the text is in that

654
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,380
RFC is a bit vague as to whether it's

655
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,899
mandatory to do this yeah and I agree

656
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,260
that assumption is that for 5884 that

657
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,399
only one uh uh DFD discriminator of the

658
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:45,120
same value can will be accepted

659
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,719
Rakesh

660
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:53,340
uh hi uh Greg um so uh we we may have uh

661
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,059
touched upon this offline but um if you

662
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,059
can also add some tax on the uh stamp

663
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,000
reflector that's a state full kind of

664
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,779
thing

665
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,760
um that would be useful as well

666
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,739
yes indeed and um yes um so um uh Rakesh

667
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,119
and footer

668
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,820
um so we we talked about it and I I

669
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,639
really appreciate uh uh discussion with

670
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,099
them because well they were inspiration

671
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,899
to this work

672
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,399
um

673
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,460
yes and uh we recently talked and uh

674
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,780
that need to be uh clearly explained

675
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,040
so um their uh feature of uh stamp

676
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,859
protocol is that it a reflector might

677
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,320
have uh to

678
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,859
um

679
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,659
modes

680
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,960
um stateful and stateless uh stateless

681
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,500
it does not allow one-way packet to us

682
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,219
measurement because uh it's not expected

683
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:58,200
uh to count packets it uh send uh to the

684
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,380
sender so thus it effectively what it

685
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,240
does it takes the sequence number from

686
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,940
receive packet copies in reflected

687
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,520
packet so the sender would cannot

688
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,940
measure one way uh packet to us

689
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,960
because always it will be the same as it

690
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,460
said

691
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,099
um so and yes I would clarify I will

692
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,260
make it explicitly uh mentioned and

693
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,060
clarify it in the next version of the

694
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,020
document

695
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,180
thank you

696
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,078
thank you thank you

697
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,960
so next

698
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,579
is

699
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,579
spp

700
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,400
hi can you hear me yes

701
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,220
okay hello everyone uh it's xiaomi

702
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,940
speaking this presentation is on lspp

703
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,540
Church roots of enabled easy to OEM

704
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,920
capabilities

705
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,660
this is a zero zero version of

706
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,379
individual draft yes

707
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,660
this is the background of this job

708
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,440
which of the iitf ippm iom state defines

709
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,420
a general method

710
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,619
of iom capabilities discovery

711
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:25,020
including iom capabilities formats

712
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,320
in that job the actual request reply is

713
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,400
used for ion capabilities discovery

714
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,599
through which the ioa and encapsulating

715
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,940
now can discover the

716
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,079
iom capabilities of each iom Transit and

717
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,060
the decapsulating nodes along the LSP

718
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,720
this chapter is a campaigning document

719
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,700
that's ippm document

720
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,119
uh specifically uh this chapter defines

721
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,540
the SPD trace route extensions

722
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,200
to achieve iof capabilities discovery in

723
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,780
nprc Networks

724
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,500
necessary

725
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,200
this page shows the newly defined two

726
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,500
SVP cubes

727
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,440
one for Echo request another for Apple

728
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,640
reply

729
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,180
uh the other figure is the format of the

730
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,660
iron capability is very POV using

731
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,579
algorithm test

732
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,700
the value field of these trvs and this

733
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,560
stuff

734
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,599
namespace IDs

735
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,720
the lower figure is the format of the

736
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,140
iom capabilities response tov

737
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,480
using Echo reply

738
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,359
the value field of this POV is a list of

739
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,060
capabilities objects

740
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,300
and each object

741
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,760
represents one type of iom capabilities

742
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
in one namespace ID

743
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,180
besides this job to define the new

744
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,060
return code

745
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,880
no match the namespace ID

746
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,820
which indicates the responder

747
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,619
found the

748
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,839
Clarity of it doesn't include any

749
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,359
Nemesis ID

750
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,420
or none of the received namespace IDs is

751
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,339
recognized

752
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,579
or none of the received Nemesis IDs is

753
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,020
enabled

754
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,780
by the local policy

755
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,220
next slide yes

756
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,000
uh for the iom capabilities response to

757
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,380
the

758
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,960
six iom capabilities sub TVs are defined

759
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,480
they are I am pre-allocated tracing

760
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,520
capabilities subdiv

761
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,460
I am incremental chasing capabilities of

762
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,599
gov

763
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,780
I am proof of Transit capabilities from

764
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,920
tov

765
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,680
I am age to age capabilities

766
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,400
imdx

767
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,640
capabilities sub POV and iom end of the

768
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,259
main subdue

769
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,380
next track is

770
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,400
this page shows an example

771
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,720
of iron capabilities query QB and

772
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,420
responsibility

773
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,220
in this example the iOS capabilities of

774
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,000
two namespace IDs our Courage by the

775
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,140
standard

776
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,920
and the responder replies with the

777
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,200
all the IM capabilities

778
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,000
corresponding to the two namespace IDs

779
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,119
enabled by the local policy

780
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,200
next slide please

781
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,000
next steps uh for this job to review our

782
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,760
comments and a collaboration always

783
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,060
welcome

784
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,820
will revise this structure to improve it

785
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,780
and then ask for working group adoption

786
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,720
that's all thank you

787
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,060
thank you

788
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,960
sultanic

789
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,540
uh Tariq is a participant thanks for the

790
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,060
draft update

791
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,180
um usually or more commonly the the

792
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,740
capabilities

793
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,160
um it's desirable to be known even prior

794
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,800
to establishing the LSP

795
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,260
um there is a dependency here that you

796
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,839
have the LSP

797
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,119
um with your approach you have to have

798
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,760
the LSP present and then your discover

799
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,660
you're discovering uh capabilities uh

800
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,260
um using this LSP trace or ping

801
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,079
um so there there is this uh shortcoming

802
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,839
I would say that you cannot discover the

803
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,200
capability before the LSP is set up

804
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,020
um and and even if you change the LSP

805
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,220
path

806
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,040
um how is that you know going to affect

807
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,900
the capabilities that you you've

808
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,060
discovered before so you have to

809
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,859
re-trigger again

810
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:24,920
every time the path changes for the LSB

811
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,660
yes I think uh if the SBP

812
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,180
changed then Discovery have updates

813
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,380
Discovery need to be triggered again

814
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,119
yes

815
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,980
do you know any uh any uh protocols or

816
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,260
mechanisms that can discover

817
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,839
capabilities before

818
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,200
or uh

819
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,420
before the spp yeah established yeah igp

820
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,060
capability advertisement so usually you

821
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,820
would flooded in igp and

822
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,579
any any head end or any in you know

823
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,560
anyone setting up the LSP would know it

824
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,680
in advance

825
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,180
uh yes

826
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,599
I I think uh the authors can compare

827
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,119
this method described in the instructor

828
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,160
and igp

829
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,140
uh method

830
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,640
and uh report to the working group

831
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,420
is that okay

832
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,940
thank you

833
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,540
no more questions okay

834
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,880
and I think declare it closed yes we'll

835
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,520
resume tomorrow with the joint session

836
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,300
right what time is it uh first thing is

837
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,180
it 9 30 9 30 then I guess yeah first

838
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,240
session so see you either tomorrow or in

839
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,740
Yokohama

840
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,879
thank you thank you

841
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:45,920
thank you

842
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,020
um

843
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,700
um

844
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,020
I don't know

845
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,619
you know for us

846
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,720
thank you

847
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,099
something

848
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,480
right up

849
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,160
