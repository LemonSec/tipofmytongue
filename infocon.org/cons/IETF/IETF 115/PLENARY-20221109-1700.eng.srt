1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,840
thank you

2
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,899
foreign

3
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,339
foreign

4
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,439
I know

5
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
already

6
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,379
but

7
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,400
all right testing

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,879
can we find our seats and check that we

9
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,099
have masks and that they are over our

10
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,680
mouth and our nose and behind our ears

11
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,620
or our neck and the ffp2 and without

12
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,980
valves and whatever else we like our

13
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,720
masks to be like and thank you very much

14
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm going to say this again later for

15
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,780
wearing them I realized there's a

16
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,700
discrepancy between what's happening in

17
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,680
the meeting rooms and outside in The

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,300
Wider world in the UK

19
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,099
we're going to consult on that going

20
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,239
forward

21
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,819
um send us your opinions but for now and

22
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:57,840
here

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,400
um Barry please oh you're actively

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,319
drinking sorry Barry just was raising

25
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,720
the cup that I didn't see

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,780
he's a professional attendee

27
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,739
so

28
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,780
um since I've all quieted you down

29
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,599
nicely welcome all to London

30
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,940
um it's great to see even more of you in

31
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,440
person than we had in Vienna and in

32
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,819
Philadelphia so I think we're on an

33
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,819
upswing post covet which is what we were

34
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,739
hoping for we're still not quite where

35
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,099
we were before and we may never get

36
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,599
there who knows but at least sort of the

37
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,819
trend looks very good

38
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,620
um my name is Louis Eggert I'm the chair

39
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,920
of the ietf and I'm going to run you

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,900
through the presentation as sort of the

41
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,000
MC for tonight

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,159
um if you wanna at some point go to the

43
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,720
microphone you should

44
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,000
scan this Qi code now I don't it

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,379
probably is going to stay up but who

46
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,120
knows uh so this is your chance to get

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,340
out your phone and that will let you get

48
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,140
in the queue because that's how we're

49
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,819
going to manage who is

50
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,620
um gonna speak next when we have open

51
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,920
mic

52
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,379
right I said this already so I made a

53
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,640
tweak to this slide because we're

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,879
techies and we like RFC 2119 so I added

55
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,400
some uppercase uh terms here to make

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,260
this sort of clearer

57
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,420
um to you right so the must and the

58
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,700
recommended and are not required and I

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,380
didn't quite go to the effort of

60
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,260
rewriting the rest of it but um you I

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,699
think this is sort of helpful you know

62
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,380
because it's like a protocol you know

63
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,639
you don't like it but you still got to

64
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,199
do it and it's fine

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,860
it brings us makes us all safer

66
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,540
um we have some really no numbers I'm

67
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,100
going to have a slide later I hope the

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,479
numbers haven't increased since that

69
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,759
slide was made but it looks very good at

70
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,740
the moment

71
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,540
um so you can take off your mask as

72
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,100
attaches Barry just did to drink

73
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,360
something that's completely fine

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,639
remember to put it back up right if you

75
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,500
sit next to somebody who forgets maybe

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,960
you nudge them and say Hey you know

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
um

78
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
um if you don't want to wear a mask you

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,880
don't have to be in this room I want to

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,560
also say that right you have the option

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,479
of leaving and then remotely

82
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,860
participating that's completely up to

83
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,180
you

84
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,380
um active speakers are people like me

85
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,600
that are babbling on the microphone not

86
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
to your neighbor

87
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,440
um so you may also take off your mask

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,479
and it's helpful because it makes the

89
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,979
audio a little bit clearer especially

90
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,080
for the remote attendees

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,300
um and we don't you know decided not to

92
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,500
uh

93
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,660
um recognize any exemptions and You

94
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,040
Gotta Wear a good mask that's the other

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,940
option

96
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,120
right enough about masks

97
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,340
the note well

98
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,259
um is an eye chart that you've all seen

99
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,479
many times by now so anything you say

100
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,940
here or elsewhere is the contribution to

101
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,380
the ITF that comes with certain

102
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,380
obligations be aware that you know what

103
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,660
they are before you start contributing

104
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,160
and that's all I'm going to say here we

105
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,860
also have some sort of code of conduct

106
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,840
obligations on you that um I think are

107
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
pretty clear

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,940
if they're not go read them up

109
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,280
um if you're online welcome

110
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,740
um if you decide to sort of well if

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,600
you're online you were joined with your

112
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,880
audio being muted and your video off and

113
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,960
if you want to go to the microphone to

114
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,100
ask a question you need to actively

115
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,919
enable your audio and I'm also going to

116
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,419
ask you to enable your video because

117
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,460
it's nice if you have a face with a

118
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,440
voice

119
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,820
um and if you have a headset and it

120
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,340
works well please use it it helps and

121
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,500
there's a long URL here with more

122
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,419
information but since you probably

123
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,800
participated earlier in the week

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
somewhere you probably know all this

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,819
already

126
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,440
and we have a slightly Fuller agenda

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,639
than normal because we have a bunch of

128
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,979
one-offs that we don't typically do so

129
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,199
we're in the welcome part uh Ted Hardy

130
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,180
from Cisco who's hosting this meeting is

131
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,100
going to do a quick presentation

132
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,600
and then we have the usual round of

133
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,819
brief updates again for me uh for the

134
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,940
iitf and the isg Familia cool event for

135
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,460
the IAB from Colin Perkins for the irtf

136
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,880
from which salts for the nomcom for the

137
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,759
ietf LLC which is split between Jay Daly

138
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,960
the executive director and Jason

139
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,639
livingood who's the director of the

140
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,740
board chair of the board

141
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,780
um we have a one-off which is the our

142
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,240
the RSE introduction Alexis Rossi is

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,620
going to say hi

144
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,419
um I have decided I'm going to start

145
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,780
pronouncing RSE as risky and I'm just

146
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,400
going to keep doing that until everybody

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,460
else does the same or or I stop either

148
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,740
one of those two are possibilities

149
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,259
um but This Acronym is I mean I wish we

150
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,460
would find something with like another

151
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,740
vowel in there somewhere

152
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,680
um right we have a preview for itf116

153
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,660
and we're going to Yokohama

154
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,819
um that got a great Round of Applause in

155
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,620
Philadelphia when we announced it um

156
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,319
we're all very excited and and one of my

157
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,819
key achievements this week I met a

158
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,099
newcomer yesterday at the social who is

159
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,440
from Yokohama or is from Japan at least

160
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
and she's going to be my dinner Booker

161
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,699
and

162
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,680
I told you to pick a nice place that she

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,940
likes because she's obviously going to

164
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,639
come along to like facilitate things and

165
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,680
this is creating a win-win situation I'm

166
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,240
going to rely on for the entire week so

167
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,919
I don't think she knows what she got

168
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,780
herself into but it's going to work

169
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,300
really well for me at least

170
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,699
um we have the uh Jonathan B pastel

171
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,039
award which is also a special uh thing

172
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,840
that we don't do all the time so Andrew

173
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,819
Sullivan uh the CEO of istock is going

174
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,800
to present that to a very deserving

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,840
individual and then we have the usual

176
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,060
round of open mic uh this time the order

177
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,020
is IAB LLC isg there's a bunch of other

178
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,240
people here that aren't part of one of

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,340
the open mics if you want to ask them

180
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,919
questions my suggestion would be if you

181
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,139
go in line while they talk but I also

182
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,180
want to

183
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,560
caution you that we didn't really budget

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,419
a whole lot of time for Q a for other

185
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,419
slots so I might cut you and tell you to

186
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,339
take it to the mail list or somewhere

187
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,779
else

188
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,458
Warren is saying something I can't

189
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,839
understand

190
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,240
might cut you off but no

191
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,440
you're so brutal

192
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,260
right uh thank you to Cisco our meeting

193
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,880

198
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,519
many forms this is not the only time

199
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
we're going to see a Cisco logo on this

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,760
slide deck I hope I didn't give anything

201
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,279
away here but so Cisco has been been you

202
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,600
know very good for the idea for a very

203
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,620
long time we're very happy they're

204
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,000
hosting us here

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,380
um they organize a great social for us

206
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,720
the food is actually very interesting I

207
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,760
don't think I ever had like a big patty

208
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,459
of meat anatolini at the same time and

209
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,839
like I was wondering what is this but

210
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,519
I've heard this for many people it was

211
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,839
very surprising combinations but they

212
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,700
were all very good and uh pretty healthy

213
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,440
and the art exhibition was it's amazing

214
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,000
and the music was great so so thank you

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,980
for that especially that was that was

216
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,880
excellent

217
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,640
and apologize the apologies to the

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,839
people who didn't get a ticket I don't

219
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,580
think I've ever seen as many emails

220
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,560
about you know who has a ticket can I

221
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,000
get one

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,560
you know there's a certain number of

223
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,120
people that Lit into these places and

224
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,380
when it's gone it's gone I think we're

225
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,140
gonna try and add something to the uh

226
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,700
new participant emails as you know

227
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,140
because it was a lot of new participants

228
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,760
who just didn't know that it was going

229
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,080
to happen and so we're going to say you

230
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,399
know if you wanna if you think you're

231
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,560
gonna come get a ticket because you

232
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,680
always can sell it at a profit later

233
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,660
so it's a little bit like an nft without

234
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,560
the ugly Parts you know it's it's

235
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
and maybe we should take a cut there's a

236
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,899
Marketplace here I'm sure that we gotta

237
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,700
who if anybody is like in this ipv4

238
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,320
reselling space I want to talk to you we

239
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,120

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,500
a lot of money Lee Burke is going to be

241
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,580

um Ted where are you I have a slide here

244
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760

245
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,279
aliens and if that's not the case you

246
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,600

those activities that benefit from that

273
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,640

313
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,980

319
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,519

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,579
um what the plan is for future meetings

335
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,639
uh experiments we're currently running

336
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,779
and a bunch of other stuff that is in

337
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,339
the written report that we announced

338
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,040
yesterday I want to say so Amy it's not

339
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,899
going to get me so good

340
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:58,620
um

341
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,420
this is the statistics and the numbers I

342
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,880
have not seen so we have quite a high

343
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,620
number of total registrations that is

344
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,600
very good to see we also have a quite

345
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,040
High number of on-site participation

346
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,320
this is more than double of Vienna and I

347
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
think we're probably at least a third

348
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,339
over Philadelphia so this is very nice

349
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,019
very good

350
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,060
um the remote fee waivers I see are

351
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,100
seeing robust use which is great that's

352
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,899
exactly what we created them for to be

353
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,700
like more open and more inclusive so so

354
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,620
thank you of to all of you who are

355
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,019
spending your time with us remotely and

356
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,420
and use that that is good to see you can

357
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,860
pay right if you know if you're working

358
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,500
for a company I would encourage you to

359
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,779
charge it but if you need to use a fee

360
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,420
waiver please feel free to do so

361
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,519
um we recently started being a little

362
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,199
bit more open about the on-site fee

363
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,579
waivers and we're running them I think

364
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,199
between Colin and me

365
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,699
um a little bit as an experiment to

366
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,139
figure out you know when do we grant

367
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,060
them and when don't we grant them and I

368
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,300
got 18 requests I granted about 11 uh

369
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,160
and and calling out a few fewer ones but

370
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,779
granted a few more

371
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,420
um we're still finding our way here uh

372
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,300
so in my mind right I want to see some

373
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,240
indication of economic hardship

374
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,699
um I want to see you know a reason why

375
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,620
you can be here in person but not pay

376
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,940
the fee

377
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,459
um I have a limited amount of them

378
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,320
um you know if you your organization

379
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,180
running out of travel budget is not

380
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,740
counted as economic hardship I'm very

381
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,519
sorry

382
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,959
um that's just the way and then they're

383
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,899
not set up to be like a perpetuous thing

384
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,540
so it's a one-off you know um you you're

385
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,339
doing good work once you're here I'm

386
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,680
gonna give you one of those but it's you

387
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,579
know not something that's going to

388
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,560
happen very often I'm afraid I have 10

389
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,540
easy I granted 11 that could already

390
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,639
took some negotiation

391
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,260
um this is about what we can do for the

392
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,399
on-site part

393
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,380
but please do ask right and don't feel

394
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,600
bad if I say no or Colin says no

395
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,339
um it's just the way it is

396
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,380
hackathon which is um

397
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,060
incredibly

398
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,660
um

399
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,240
well attended still we had 452

400
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
registrations a lot on site a lot more I

401
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
think again compared to Vienna and

402
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,860
Philadelphia a lot of projects

403
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,600
um and a lot of people remote so so this

404
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,300
has really become one of sort of the

405
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,279
extremely good

406
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,380
um ways in which the iitf has started to

407
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,480
outreach into open source and I can't

408
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,740
thank the people who are running this

409
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,839
enough and who are investing in it and I

410
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,399
can't thank the organizations that

411
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,779
support it enough it's really become

412
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,600
sort of a core event at the IHF although

413
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
we still say it's not officially part of

414
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,480
it

415
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,980
um it really is

416
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,060
um right which brings us to the pie

417
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,019
chart

418
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,600
um we have uh you know a number of

419
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,160
people from a number of places as usual

420
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,440
uh as usual women in Europe or or near

421
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,420
to Europe I should say now I guess

422
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,019
um

423
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,399
um quite a few participants from Europe

424
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,800
we have the usual mix uh between the USA

425
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,000
and others

426
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,279
um so that's pretty nice uh China is

427
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,199
still much lower unfortunately than it

428
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,639
used to be but it's ticking up I hear

429
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,199
it's getting easier for our Chinese

430
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,699
participants to travel that is really

431
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,019
good to see

432
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,579
um I think we're working on making it

433
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,920
easy for you to come to Yokohama there's

434
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,160
a way we're doing invitation letters or

435
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,199
the equivalent that you need to come and

436
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,880
I think there will be something in email

437
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,699
soon so please join us when we're closer

438
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,020
to you that'd be great

439
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,339
um this is the same pie chart split out

440
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,319
between on-site and remote

441
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,299
um it looks roughly similar the colors

442
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,000
are the same as previously and between

443
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,679
those two pie charts which confuse the

444
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,419
hell out of me in Vienna

445
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,280
um so it's it's roughly the same split

446
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,839
there's a few other sort of things you

447
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,119
noticeably see China is unsurprisingly

448
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,559
much more represented in the remote

449
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,940
attendance

450
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,740
um although time zones are not uh in

451
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
their favor here but that is really good

452
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,179
to see and I'm hoping that these 18 from

453
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,160
China are going to come back to be on

454
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
site very soon

455
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,039
covet cases we've had four

456
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,500
um so far we've been significantly worse

457
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,919
at this time of the week both in Vienna

458
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,240
and in Philadelphia so that makes us

459
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,620
really hopeful that we're going to have

460
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,280
a much lower number of reported cases

461
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,740
um this meeting than than uh last it

462
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,660
sort of seems to indicate that we're

463
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,100
sort of on the downswing of the pandemic

464
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,780
which is great it also means that you

465
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,919
guys are really good in general about

466
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,200
wearing your masks if one of us reminds

467
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,059
you don't feel bad right we get reminded

468
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,220
too it's just you don't see it

469
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,320
um we got to sort of watch each other a

470
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,539
little bit and if you um you know want

471
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,580
to provide feedback there's a survey

472
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,260
that Jay is going to send out after the

473
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,940
meeting and we're also going to consult

474
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,280
on what our masking and covert policy

475
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,160
should be going forward we changed it a

476
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,140
little bit coming to London

477
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,880
um Yokohama is going to have some

478
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,520
government restrictions in place I think

479
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,320
still today but it might change so we

480
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,580
have to have a conversation we're

481
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,440
probably going to do there but I think

482
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,500
the general expectation would be that we

483
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,380
try to follow the rules that are you

484
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,000
know the local regulations at the place

485
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,160
we're going to over time it's a

486
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
conversation between you know the

487
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,400
community and and Leadership so please

488
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
do send feedback

489
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,640
um there are free masks there are free

490
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,919
tests they are free aspirin and Tylenol

491
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,120
which are helpful even if you don't have

492
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,500
covet

493
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,120
um there's many other goodies that are

494
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,559
down in Secretariat area so if you need

495
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,059
something right

496
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,380
um so this whole like I don't have a

497
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,760
mask it doesn't really cut it because

498
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,320
they're everywhere and you can just grab

499
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,220
one

500
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,720
um so so please do

501
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,320
um

502
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,120
and there's three tests right and if you

503
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,220
do test positive we do ask that you

504
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,380
isolate and email the Secretariat

505
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,419
there's a support email at the bottom uh

506
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,740
they'll take care of you

507
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,820
um you don't need to worry about

508
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,400
anything just you know please be in your

509
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,660
room for a bit and they'll tell you what

510
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,380
we want you to do

511
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,480
experiments we have not a lot

512
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,660
um there's the RFC 8989 nomcom

513
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,179
eligibility experiment uh that we

514
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,679
chartered the log working group for

515
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,340
which is trying to sort of Define new

516
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,340
eligibility criteria for the nomcom

517
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,740
because the old eligibility criteria

518
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,020
before the experiment restricted

519
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,880
themselves to only counting people that

520
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,160
were here in person and since we had a

521
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,539
bunch of meetings where nobody was in

522
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,460
person that wouldn't really have worked

523
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,720
if we wanted to have people on the

524
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,600
nomcom this now is charted to sort of

525
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,120
come up with a permanent replacement of

526
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,600
whatever the RFC was that RFC 8989 is an

527
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,860
experiment on

528
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,179
um and the expectation is that that

529
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,700
would sort of limit just before this

530
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,440
um it would finish hopefully reasonably

531
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,780
soon like in the next weeks or months at

532
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,200
the very latest

533
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,960
um we had four isg announcements uh you

534
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,240
got them uh on ITF announced if you're

535
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,980
subscribed if not I encourage you to

536
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,780
subscribe to it

537
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,820
um we did

538
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,679
about zero appeals which is a nice thing

539
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,900
we did an isg statement one wants to

540
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,559
clap good job isg and good job Community

541
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,080
I guess uh we uh put out a statement on

542
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,360
restricting access to itfit systems um

543
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,160
the summary is that

544
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,380
um we want to be transparent about what

545
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,539
the isg intends to do if the lawyers

546
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,919
come and say

547
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,660
um we have a case where we need to

548
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,400
basically stop somebody from accessing

549
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,280
the iitfit systems because they pose a

550
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,660
legal risk to the organization so

551
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,160
somebody's sharing like BitTorrent links

552
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,740
or you know

553
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,660
things like that so it needs to be a

554
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,580
significant legal risk to the

555
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,400
um to the ietf and the LLC is sort of

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,799
the home for that but the LLC decided

557
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,660
that the isg should really be the one

558
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,240
that's uh putting out the guidance here

559
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,160
because it obviously impacts the

560
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,260
standards process and so we put out a

561
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,760
statement and we basically had this

562
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,140
policy of what we're trying to do and

563
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,340
how we're going to communicate it and

564
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,960
and the intenders you know this will

565
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,000
never be used until the lawyers uh come

566
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,280
and say you really have to otherwise

567
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,020
it's going to be bad

568
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,000
and there's a lot more stuff at the link

569
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,799
into the data tracker that has a bunch

570
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,500
of written uh reports that we did and

571
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,940
there's a Blog that Greg is sort of

572
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,740
feeding with material if you have a

573
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,080
story for Greg it's ITF related

574
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,760
um Gregory are you can you raise your

575
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,520
hand he's there talk to him he's always

576
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,260
happy for Content

577
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,720
um and um he's going to feed our blog

578
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,159
and social media Channels with it so

579
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,720
that we are

580
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,980
becoming influencers

581
00:21:58,679 --> 00:21:59,820
right

582
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,620
um this is a slide that originated with

583
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,120
genard which is my director that does

584
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,919
reviews for me and that I find really

585
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,679
useful and it's basically um reminding

586
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,419
me that they could use more reviewers

587
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,760
and and other area directors when I said

588
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,679
that that my directorate could also use

589
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,960
more reviewers so if you want to become

590
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,539
a reviewer talk to the ads or if you

591
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,919
know the person who runs the director

592
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,559
talk to them you don't have to have been

593
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,120
around for a long time generate

594
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,340
specifically you know it does general

595
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,900
reviews where people that are not

596
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,340
familiar with the technology read the

597
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,320
document to sort of Judge whether it is

598
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,840
even understandable for example right so

599
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,700
so there's no requirement that you need

600
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,140
to have a graveyard have been around for

601
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,760
like two decades

602
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,500
um so so please consider that you know

603
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,760
even if you're a new participant and you

604
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,020
want to maybe read something and I

605
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,520
actually hear that a lot of director

606
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,620
members value it because they get to see

607
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,120
stuff that they wouldn't see as part of

608
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,220
their regular idea of participation and

609
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,360
it really sort of broadens up your

610
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,919
horizon

611
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,299
um and there's some new directorates so

612
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:55,980
we're going to need some reviewers and

613
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,659
members for those two

614
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:58,919
um the one thing I want to mention is

615
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,539
you can actually in the data tracker

616
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,159
which we use for managing the reviews

617
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,320
say that you know I want to have you

618
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,360
know one assignment a quarter or a week

619
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,400
or you know I'm gonna be on vacation for

620
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
three months here so don't give me

621
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,640
anything so you can basically tell us or

622
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,080
tell the system what your load is and

623
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,280
that will be taken into account and

624
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,140
there's no hard feelings if you need to

625
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,520
go away for a bit because of day job or

626
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
other reasons so so please do consider

627
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,940
this

628
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,700
and finally um so um you might have

629
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,900
noticed when you're down in the

630
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,360
mezzanine uh is it mezzanine

631
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,640
there there are some kids there and

632
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,380
that's because we have daycare again we

633
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,760
had it in Vienna and we had it in

634
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,080
Philadelphia

635
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,659
so we are planning uh to provide child

636
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,539
care at all the 2023 meetings and I hear

637
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,580
probably going forward if the community

638
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,980
likes it and it seems so based on what I

639
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,200
heard and and sort of I'm putting this

640
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
here now because you know bringing kids

641
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,299
to a trip take some planning so you can

642
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,340
plan on this now um like if you want to

643
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,419
bring your kids to Yokohama there's

644
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,100
going to be child care there I think the

645
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,600
aspiration is that it will be in English

646
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,740
at least and not just in Japanese I see

647
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,320
some careful nodding um

648
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,780
and it's also sort of available there's

649
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,640
some details on the web page or from a

650
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,100
for a pretty wide age range

651
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,780
um so so if you

652
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,220
um have kids and it would make it easier

653
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,780
for you to attend please do take

654
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,340
advantage of this

655
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,500
um we have dni diversity and inclusion

656
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,179
money that is specifically given to the

657
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,580
iitf to provide services like this

658
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,380
um so you using it is not going to cost

659
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,240
us anything additionally it's it's there

660
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,700
for for using it that's why we provide

661
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,559
it because we want to be able for people

662
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,200
to to come to us

663
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,820
I'm going to try and plan to use it in

664
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,200
Oklahoma but we'll see how that goes

665
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,380
because airfares are expensive

666
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,860
and that brings us to Miriam and the IAB

667
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,059
and her slides

668
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,658
I see you

669
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,720
show us yours

670
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,340
yeah and I will be very quick I only

671
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,720
have two slides because there's more

672
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,460
exciting stuff on the agenda but I still

673
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,679
wanted to come up here to show you my

674
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,240
face especially those people who might

675
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,080
not know me so here I am and as I'm here

676
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm presenting you to boring slides so

677
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,940
first slide is we send a written report

678
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,500
so if you're actually interested in all

679
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
the details what the IAB is doing or not

680
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,480
doing you can read the report there's a

681
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,460
link it's in the proceedings the only

682
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,039
two things I wanted to mention here is

683
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,840
the the recent workshops so there was a

684
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,120
workshop on

685
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,220
I'm starting with the second one here on

686
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,659
the slide so you know can get confused

687
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,860
there was a workshop on management

688
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,480
techniques and encrypted networks that

689
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,340
just happened recently

690
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,140
um you can find all the papers all the

691
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,659
slides and the recordings online and

692
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,159
there's a report to be written very soon

693
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,679
hopefully and then there's a workshop

694
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,900
coming up uh very soon first week of

695
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,640
December you just missed the deadline I

696
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,740
think it was Monday

697
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,440
um about environmental impact so the

698
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,480
idea is to figure out how much impact

699
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,100
the internet as a whole has is there a

700
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,539
way to measure it and like make an

701
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:58,860
assessment and then understanding if

702
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,360
there's anything we need to do in that

703
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,500
space

704
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,200
so um these are two things that the IAB

705
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
is working on just to give you an

706
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,960
impression there's more in the report or

707
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,460
you can also talk to me or any IAB

708
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,539
member if you want to learn wrong

709
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,340
and then my second slide is just I would

710
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,900
like to take the opportunity to say

week and meeting candidates and

829
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,760
community members to gather feedback so

830
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,080
if you haven't had a chance to send your

831
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,760
feedback to a nomcom I will tell you now

832
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,860
that you could do so immediately if you

833
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,600
want when you're bored here and which is

834
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,620
going to tell you a lot more about it

835
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,860
thanks

836
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
thanks

837
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,279
okay okay hi

838
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,340
um

839
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,320
uh we did start late for a variety of

840
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,419
circumstances we think we'll end on time

841
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,179
and that came at the expense of pretty

842
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,100
much every step of the process

843
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,440
uh previously you had like six weeks to

844
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,659
do the questionnaire uh this time it was

845
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,880
2.14

846
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,919
right 15 days

847
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,600
um we're drilling the interviews this

848
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,380
week as much as possible amap uh as

849
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,419
Laura said get your feedback in if you

850
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,279
go to the nomcom page

851
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,740
you'll see a link about it

852
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,460
um

853
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,740
or come see me I'm happy to take

854
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,000
in-person feedback and uh keep your let

855
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,100
your name be known or not as you prefer

856
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,159
you've had instances of both

857
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,980
so the isg asked me to I got a note from

858
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,200
them uh asking me to talk about some of

859
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
the technical hiccups that occur

860
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,640
look inside

861
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,799
um and reassure everyone I want to

862
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,360
reassure that there were some hiccups we

863
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,000
resolved them and just by coincidence

864
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,760
oops

865
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,500
sorry just by coincidence I happen to be

866
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,659
on almost every slate so I hope

867
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,760
everybody's reassured now

868
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,500
um more seriously as I said we got a

869
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,940
late start questionnaires weren't ready

870
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,100
some of the messages that went out to

871
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,320
the candidates was boy I really blew it

872
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,140
uh was confusing because it said your

873
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,240
questionnaire is below or in one place

874
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,559
that said your questionnaire is going to

875
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,179
be attached

876
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,860
um and

877
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,080
that'll be fixed in the data tracker in

878
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,539
the future release uh it is very hard to

879
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,419
test data tracker uh changes for nam-com

880
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,880
uh it doesn't happen very often on like

881
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
drafts and and that standard workflow

882
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,080
um

883
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,140
there was a new version of openssl

884
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,940
always a danger

885
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,000
um private key upload didn't work uh

886
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,980
until Robert and I got on a zoom zoom

887
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,960
call and he fixed it uh what that meant

888
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,279
is

889
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,679
every comment you sent to Nam com is

890
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,320
encrypted and the key to decrypted or

891
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,779
the key to decrypt the encryption key is

892
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,299
only shared among the non-com members so

893
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,100
that nobody else can see you know when

894
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,779
we say your your information is

895
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,039
confidential including your

896
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,740
questionnaire responses

897
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,720
um that's also called Financial we

898
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,000
didn't lose any feedback

899
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,399
um we held you know held things in the

900
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,260
moderation queue until we got that all

901
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,779
fixed and we did some tests and it works

902
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,019
uh the flow from AMS to the data tracker

903
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,820
for the registrations getting people who

904
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,080
had registered and qualified

905
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,179
automatically entered uh that was a

906
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,580
manual process people may remember I

907
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,220
said oh we we've had like 12 more people

908
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,159
or 20 more people who qualified that's

909
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,220
going to now be automatic in the future

910
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,720
um there was an appeal when I had to

911
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,419
disqualify someone that added some delay

912
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,520
to the process all this will be in the

913
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,560
report that you can not read at the end

914
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,000
of the next meeting

915
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,780
um

916
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,879
it was reasonable to make the the appeal

917
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,739
uh that also took some time we did have

918
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,839
a backup plan and so on uh there's

919
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,879
ambiguities in the RFC that controls the

920
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,760
nomination process 8713

921
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,859
um a router or file to make sure all of

922
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,000
those things are cleared up in the

923
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
future

924
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,020
um some implications of that RFC also

925
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,580
weren't well documented like the

926
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,619
repeatability to process the format by

927
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,300
which the names come out the verify

928
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,020
verifiability of the voting volunteers

929
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,020
um we did end up with a verified process

930
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,659
at least three people verified

931
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,918
um and so on

932
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,560
uh I sent out several mails to

933
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,199
candidates warning them about the

934
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,660
deadline I was told that some people

935
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,160
never got the mails because they have a

936
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,339
filter that ignores their names on BCC

937
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,680
I don't think that's my fault

938
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,480
um I did also send out announced mails

939
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,580
to ietf announced warning people about

940
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,500
the deadlines

941
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,300
and got a couple messages saying why are

942
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,400
you sending this spam to all of the ITF

943
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,280
so I guess you can't win uh there was

944
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,020
concern as I said feedback was lost that

945
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,740
that didn't happen uh male aliases and

946
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,099
SPF dkim do not interact very well with

947
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,040
mailing lists uh wow do they not

948
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,079
interact well at all so we had to

949
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,820
convert things from an alias to a

950
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,560
mailing list it's not archived and all

951
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,020
this but all that is handled now back to

952
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,180
the thing I really wanted to say

953
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,240
uh which is thanks to the people

954
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,579
um Robert Glenn Jennings Holland uh

955
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,500
Glenn from ASL

956
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,359
um could not do the job without them

957
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,200
they're amazing and

958
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,400
full of energy and like do you need this

959
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,839
now do you need this today do you need

960
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,900
this tomorrow uh the voting volunteers

961
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,680
um

962
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,040
it's well never mind being analogy um

963
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,079
people are really very dedicated we had

964
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,280
meetings where we went through the

965
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,220
questionnaires we had meetings video

966
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,800
meetings where we went through the list

967
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,359
of questions we would ask all the

968
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:13,619
nominees

969
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:14,420
um

970
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,980
lots of points were seriously considered

971
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,260
and there was very reasoned discussion

972
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,380
from across the voting volunteers

973
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,119
um and they are doing a really excellent

974
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,240
job listening to the interviews I try to

975
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,339
sit on it as many as I can

976
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,260
um the discussions there and the

977
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,520
interviews are very thoughtful the

978
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,680
candidates for

979
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,720
the most part are giving very thoughtful

980
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,720
answers and finally the whole ITF

981
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,619
community

982
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,440
having

983
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,240
been on the losing end of things

984
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,640
multiple times I know that one of the

985
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,099
things the I denominated committee takes

986
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,040
very seriously is community feedback so

987
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,980
please give us Community feedback thank

988
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,099

Thank you Rich this is a non-com chair

990

992

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,400
how we measure our carbon emissions from

1087
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,040
meetings and to look at what forms of

1088
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,800
offsets we might do the plan is that for

1089

the meetings next year we'll be

1090

00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,359
scheme

1092
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,920

to mitigate the effect of traveling um

1097
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,300

1179
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,010
this work for us thank you

1180
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:57,060
[Applause]

1181
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,160
and in case you need a photograph of all

1182
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,180
of us

1183
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,880
um I've lost roughly 28 pounds since

1184
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,319
that was taken so I've got a new one

1185
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,060
coming very shortly

1186
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,359
okay

1187
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,520
um and then finally so an option if you

1188
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,500
know that the way that our meetings work

1189
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,020
is that we have these companies who are

1190
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,300
a global host and Global supporters so

1191
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,040
they sign a long contract with us

1192
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,859
generally six or nine years they pay us

1193
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,319
a fee every year towards this

1194
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:26,940
um and then they get an opportunity to

1195
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,859
host a meeting with a host do the global

1196
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,240
supporters just pay us because they

1197
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,400
think it's the right thing to do we meet

1198
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,380
with these people at every meeting and

1199
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,819
we sit down and we talk to them we ask

1200
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:37,680
them what value are you getting from

1201
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,520
your

1202
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,140
um sponsorship you know what more could

1203
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,440
we do and the answer always is we're

1204
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,760
doing it because this is the right thing

1205
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,740
to do we want to support the ITF don't

1206
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,540
worry about the value oh and the coffee

1207
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,540
carts are lovely so really you know I

1208
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,359
can't do this uh we have uh just a

1209
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,160
generation of people in the right

1210
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,780
positions Within These companies that

1211
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,460

1212
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,619
and make that contribution to us without

1213

00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,520
um we are with 119

1228
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,619
um close to uh something there we think

1229
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:41,940
and we'll be able to announce that quite

1230
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,740
soon that's an exciting one coming up

1231
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,440
and um with Europe

1232
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,900
um were you still arguing every day

1233
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,280
about what we think the particular

1234
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,079
issues with that one but we're very

1235
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,579
close hopefully to getting that one as

1236
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,680
well okay so we should have that full

1237
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,540
pipeline filled quite shortly and see

1238
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,319
where we go from there

1239
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,839
um so onto the intf endowment so for

1240
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,819
those of you who are not aware that we

1241
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,140
have an endowment

1242
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,300
um it was created to support the ITF and

1243
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,160
its activities for the long term to give

1244
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,200
us Financial Independence

1245
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,060
um so that we end up with a diversity of

1246
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,339
income while we have those companies

1247
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:18,960
that have sponsor us for our meetings

1248
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,460
while we have money from the internet

1249
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,020
Society

1250
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,859
um it all of this it relies on two or

1251
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:27,720
three small markets you know um

1252
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,000
preparative globally uh the domain name

1253
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,940
side from internet Society equip

1254
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,680
manufacturer and services

1255
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,960
um operators so we're looking to

1256
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,760
diversify income by receiving as much

1257
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,380
money as we can and having that as an

1258
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,700
investment enables us to continue

1259
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,920
throughout whatever may happen in the

1260
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,540
ups and downs coming

1261
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,160
um and there's I think a number of us

1262
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,240
are seeing it looks like there's a

1263
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,040
potential downcoming so this is what

1264
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,359
we're trying to do is prepare for these

1265
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,220
sort of things so if you'd like to

1266
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,859
donate you can do so there and we do

1267
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:57,960
make an effort to thank people who um

1268
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,579
very much who donate to that

1269
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,720
um so uh for the uh on the endowment

1270
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,119
um the internet Society have a special

1271
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,060
matching program that is lasting for

1272
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,359
um until 2027 I believe so that

1273
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,060
um if uh any money that we get is

1274
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,740
matched two to one initially and then

1275
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,020
we've matched it one to one initially so

1276
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,220
um Now's the Time to give us money

1277
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,780
because it's very much

1278
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,460
um matched

1279
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,020
um and

1280
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,359

itf-114 a few of us work together to

1321
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,040
publish a PDF document and we blogged

1322
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,560
put it on the blog about the coveted

1323
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,180
mitigations and the numbers we saw and

1324
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,900
so on and we had a number of other

1325
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,220
standards Dev and other industry orgs

1326
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,720
reach out and say that they thought that

1327
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,400
was interesting and you know informed

1328
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,020
some of the things they were doing

1329
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,780
uh but we continue to discuss what the

1330
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,300
future meeting approaches may be and you

1331
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,520
know how that will be evolving and as

1332
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,200
Jay mentioned that'll be the subject of

1333
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,119
some of the survey questions that follow

1334
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,040
this meeting

1335
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,660
um and also as Jay mentioned we continue

1336
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,480
to focus on fundraising progress we've

1337
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,280
got this wonderful matching program

1338
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,020
right now and we are really doing our

1339
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,720
best to try to encourage donors and

1340
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,500
these take a long time to cultivate

1341
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,720
um and folks that are usually willing to

1342
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,060
write checks of that size you know don't

1343
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,160
do it um you know at the spur of the

1344
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,599
moment they give it quite a lot of

1345
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:56,520
thought which you'd expect but we've got

1346
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,619
a great matching program just to keep

1347
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:02,040
banging that drum so looking for uh for

1348
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,220
some progress there and um thankfully

1349
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,560
with the ietf trust Glenn does not have

1350
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,380
coveted this meeting so um we are having

1351
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,420
an advantage now that we're back in

1352
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,680
person to have a joint meeting between

1353
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,140
the trust and the LLC and in particular

1354
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,119
since they are moving into this new

1355
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,579
corporate structure uh talking about how

1356
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,319
we can better support them you know what

1357
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,700
funding needs they have for next year

1358
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,200
and so on

1359
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,540
um so that's uh continuing of course

1360
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,000
we're in the midst of 2023 budgeting and

1361
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,800
you'll hear more about that at some

1362
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,060
point soon

1363
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,280
um and you know as we lock down that

1364
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,140
budget and then of course there's some

1365
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,940
you know more um

1366
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,619
you know higher level long-term

1367
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,680
questions we always continue focusing on

1368
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,020
things like are there gaps that emerge

1369
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,960
you know post-isoc spin-off we did the I

1370
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,540
asked it to retrospective last year or

1371
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,460
earlier this year maybe it was we

1372
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,619
continue to look at things if there are

1373
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,140
gaps and how do we fill them but really

1374
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,300
the bigger questions are are sort of

1375
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,980
these last three and they all group

1376
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,020
together you know what's the new normal

1377
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,000
for hybrid meeting attendance numbers

1378
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,099
and how do we adapt and that really

1379
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,440
means how do the contracts for venues

1380
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,140
adapt and what sort of room size

1381
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,059
commitments or block commitments are

1382
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:16,680
there and what are the cost implications

1383
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,839
look like you know what are the

1384
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,599
potential cancellation fees for changes

1385
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,640
or reductions if there are you know

1386
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,400
further um you know spikes in the virus

1387
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,140
and so on

1388
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,700
um and so those are the questions that I

1389
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,859
think we're we're all trying to think

1390
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,540
about and they do have cost implications

1391
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,380
which we'll see shortly

1392
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:38,880
um so here are the implement

1393
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,800
applications of some of those things so

1394
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,540
putting aside for a moment which I'll

1395
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,700
come back to Investments the on-site

1396
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,500
meeting registrations were much lower

1397
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,200
than forecast for this year and I think

1398
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,740
if we go back to one year ago from now

1399
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,660
nobody really knew what was going to

1400
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,220
happen with covid we had to make some

1401
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,440
educated guesses and some of those

1402
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,839
guesses you know were not as you know

1403
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:02,940
close to what the reality ended up being

1404
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,160
but of course if any of us were really

1405
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,839
great with you know forecasting what

1406
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:09,300
would happen with covid we probably you

1407
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,160
know would have made other you know

1408
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,559
investment decisions and and uh you know

1409
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,500
uh what have you so that was I think the

1410
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,619
Big Challenge and um we're trying to I

1411
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:22,800
think look forward to next year and the

1412
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,300
years beyond that particularly of the

1413
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,400
years that we're signing venue contracts

1414
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,559
for you know what does that mean about

1415
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,500
room block sizes and

1416
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,180
um and other sort of commitments that go

1417
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,740
along with that so we'll see what

1418
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,880
happens

1419
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,040
um and uh it'll be really interesting to

1420
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,319
see the next years as Lars pointed out

1421
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,599
really good numbers this meeting that

1422
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,160
was a relief for us

1423
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,380
um but we'll see what happens and of

1424
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,059
course in terms of um you know

1425
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,400
Investments you know we're not looking

1426
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,520
to sell any investments in the near term

1427
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,800
um and so uh you know these are just

1428
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,440
sort of paper uh changes but obviously

1429
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,319
the the global stock markets um have had

1430
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:04,020
some challenges lately What with um you

1431
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,920
know a war conflict in Ukraine and so on

1432
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,380
so uh we'll see what happens hopefully

1433
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,540
uh you know world economies take a turn

1434
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,400
for the better but it does look like

1435
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,319
certainly the winter

1436
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,940
um will be a tough time in the next few

1437
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,059
months

1438
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:22,260
and then lots of ways that you can

1439
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,720
contact us don't hesitate to reach out

1440

00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,200
and that's all for the LLC portion thank

1442
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,319
you

1443
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,040
thank you and the LLC will be back on

1444
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,960
stage later for Open Mic

1445
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,220
um and uh

1446
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,240
I'm going to talk a little bit about

1447
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,480
Alexis Rossi the new risky uh coming to

1448
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,040
this stage

1449
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,839
um to introduce ourselves so so

1450
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:46,859
um as you know that we had this

1451
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,859
restructuring of the RFC editor process

1452
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:51,720
and with that came came a new uh

1453
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,579
position and a new title and a new hire

1454
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:56,960
and that is Alexis welcome

1455
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:00,780
hi everybody I'm really loving this

1456
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,339
risky thing because it goes very well

1457
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,140
risky Rossi

1458
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,520
um and I think everyone else is going to

1459
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,520
have to live up to that after me uh were

1460
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,220
you as risky as the risky Rossi

1461
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,079
um let's try to say that three times

1462
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:13,920
fast

1463
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,540
so I thought I would say just a little

1464
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,819
bit about my background and who I am so

1465
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,280
you can kind of get to know me

1466
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,220
um I've started out as a cookbook editor

1467
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,680
way back in the day and then fell in

1468
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,079
love with the internet and joined a

1469
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,720
place called clarinet back in 1996 that

1470
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,520
was one of the first news aggregators on

1471
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,280
the net old enough that uh it was still

1472
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,040
being published in Usenet news groups

1473
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,559
um and then eventually kind of worked my

1474
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,020
way through a couple of other things and

1475
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,000
ended up at the internet archive which

1476
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,339
is a digital library

1477
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:48,780
um non-profit that you can get to at

1478
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,880
archive.org and the thing that most

1479
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,859
people know them for is the Wayback

1480
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,599
machine

1481
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,819
um so at the archive I've been there for

1482
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,260
about 20 years

1483
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,579
um and I'm still there in a part-time

1484
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,400
capacity uh at the archive life

1485
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,740
originated a website that is supposed to

1486
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,599
have one web page for every book ever

1487
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:07,940
published which is called

1488
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,680
openlibrary.org I ran the Wayback

1489
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,740
machine for uh I don't know four or five

1490
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,500
years something like that I'm in there

1491
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,020
somewhere I went to library school

1492
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,460
um and now I'm kind of the head

1493
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,900
librarian for all of the media

1494
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,119
collections there so that's television

1495
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,400
and radio and podcasts and movies and

1496
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,040
audio and software uh if you have any

1497
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,900
questions about any of that I'm always

1498
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,579
happy to talk about it because I'm still

1499
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,020
there and I'm I'm like their favorite

1500
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,880
mouthpiece

1501
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,339
um so starting here

1502
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:39,839
um I'm trying to bring some of that

1503
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,180
archival and library and editorial

1504
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,240
experience into this new role

1505
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,740
um that I think is still kind of a

1506
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,540
little bit ill-defined and we're still

1507
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,220
sort of trying to figure out what that

1508
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,359
role means now uh under the new editor

1509
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:56,760
model so the things I'm starting with

1510
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,579
the things I'm working on currently are

1511
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:04,339
an R uh revamp of the RFC uh Dash uh

1512
00:56:04,339 --> 00:56:08,339
editor.org website uh that's just in its

1513
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:10,319
infancies if you have any feedback you'd

1514
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,559
like to provide about that let me know

1515
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:16,559
um I I have sent out a document to a

1516
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,300
small number of people and that will be

1517
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,099
continuing as we go through the research

1518
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:23,280
phase and you'll be asked for more input

1519
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,040
um also uh working on our archival

1520
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,839
agreements making sure that there are

1521
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,819
full copies of the rfcs that you all

1522
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,339
work so hard on in other institutions

1523
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:33,780
and that's something that we do for

1524
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,599
archival safe keeping uh and getting a

1525
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,720
couple more of those set up uh so

1526
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,180
basically that's where we are right now

1527
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,460
and I've only been doing this for about

1528

[Applause]

1543

1546
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,160

um Glenn is up with the trust uh take it

1548
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,619
away

1549
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,380
either I'm gladine and I'm the IHF trust

1550
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:54,359
chair now Covet free uh

1551
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:58,800
so uh I'm gonna start off by saying I'm

1552
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,660
going to take my challenge the IAB said

1553
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,300
their slides were the most boring

1554
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,059
challenge accepted I'm about to talk to

1555
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:08,819
a bunch of engineering experts about

1556
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,760
trust stuff which is all legal things so

1557
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,319
I think this may be the most boring of

1558
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:15,440
all

1559
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,940
so the first what I like to point out is

1560
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,099
the trustee is made up of five trustees

1561
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,079
they're appointed three of them from the

1562
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,079
non-com one from the isg and one from

1563
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,059
the isoc Board of Trustees

1564
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:30,420
uh I'm the chair Kathleen Moriarty who

1565
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,480
couldn't be here for this IHF is the

1566
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,579
treasurer Joel helper he's around so if

1567
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,220
you see him in the Halls say hi Stephan

1568
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,460
Wagner is also here I don't trustees and

1569
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,740
Victor hersing he is a trustee I think

1570
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,058
he's round I saw him yesterday

1571
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,420
so it if you don't know what the its

1572
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,819
trust does don't feel bad

1573
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:55,799
when I first started coming to the ITF

1574
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:59,280
uh many years ago I would come to the

1575
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,200
plenary and the customer can come up and

1576
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,940
talk about what the trusts had done that

1577
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,040
time and they would often say we haven't

1578
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,799
been sued by anybody recently and that

1579
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:09,299
was awesome but I didn't quite ever

1580
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,040
understand really why and I didn't

1581
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,799
understand what the trust did and then I

1582
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:16,380
somehow found myself as a trustee and I

1583
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,940
somehow found myself eventually his

1584
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,799
chair and I guess I had to figure it out

1585
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:21,660
so let me try to impart a little bit of

1586
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,400
what I learned along the journey

1587
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,299
the trust manages IP assets for the ITF

1588
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,520
and why that's important is that the

1589
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,680
standards development process generates

1590
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,260
a lot of stuff uh the contributions that

1591
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,339
we all make and that we're all making

1592
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:40,500
today sitting in this room uh the

1593
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,000
photographs being taken the video being

1594
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,559
taken and the comments of the microphone

1595
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:46,140
are all contributions to the ITF Trust

1596
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,760
and to the ITF

1597
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,700
and so ultimately the ITF trust takes

1598
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,079
care of managing and protecting these

1599
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,480
various things for the community and so

1600
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,559
there's a list of the things right there

1601
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,540
it's a bunch of software licenses it's

1602
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,440
like

1603
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,020
copyrights on photographs and that kind

1604
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,940
of stuff but it's important and it

1605
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,420
enables the ITF to function

1606
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,160
this is sort of the big picture of how

1607
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,040
it helps the ITF develop standards

1608
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,780
so you know we all come together and we

1609
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,520
write drafts and we make comments on

1610
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,079
microphones those are all ITF

1611
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,260
contributions and those are going to two

1612
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,760
places one of them goes into the ITF

1613
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,200
itself right goes into all of us when we

1614
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,000
sit in our media rooms we work on our

1615
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,160
our various working groups

1616
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,900
those contributions go in there the

1617
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,299
ideas go in there the thoughts right the

1618
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,040
things we make

1619
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,540
there's another part that a lot of

1620
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,160
people kind of sort of go yes to and

1621
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,780
don't really understand which is the

1622
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,579
rights that are granted under RFC 5378

1623
01:00:40,579 --> 01:00:44,099
those uh grants are what enable the rest

1624
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,200
of the process actually happen because

1625
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,880
if you hadn't noticed you also didn't

1626
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,500
need to go off and sign up a lot of

1627
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,000
documentation with your lawyers before

1628
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,260
you come into the room and hang out with

1629
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:52,920
everybody

1630
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,839
that's because the IHF trust was created

1631
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,180
and the whole way it integrates with the

1632
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,680
development process is really elegant

1633
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,119
and you got to read the documentation

1634
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,579
and the rfcs that set it up to really

1635
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,319
these things are beautiful they were

1636
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,180
done back in 2005 but in short the trust

1637
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,099
takes care of those granted rights it

1638
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:13,619
tells the ITF yep we got this stuff go

1639
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:14,640
ahead and use it in your development

1640
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,599
process

1641
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,420
the IHF goes off and creates rfcs which

1642
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,480

1646
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,640
don't charge a fee uh we really don't

1647
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,839
charge a fee to anybody for any of this

1648
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:33,480
stuff but we say world can use the stuff

1649

Victor's in particular uh they really

1673
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,740
helped uh during the asset to transition

1674
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,540
to handle updating the trust documents

1675
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,700
and a lot of the software licenses or

1676

1679
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,819
they just wrote so thank you uh and we

1680
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:43,859
now have a new representation uh Andy

1681
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:46,020
upper Grove uh from gessemer up to Grove

1682
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,720
will be representing the trusts as our

1683
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,520
lawyer going forward

1684
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,660
ah there's a couple other things here

1685
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,119
we had a report where it was a an error

1686
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,599
in the uh trust FAQs on our website and

1687
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:02,040
so we took that in we took a look at it

1688
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,040
and gosh they were right

1689
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,619
what had happened was at some point uh

1690
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,619
two RFC references had got swapped and

1691
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:11,760
it would be way too hard to explain

1692
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,619
which one went where so what we

1693
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:15,660
typically did was we put up an FAQ

1694
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,640
update on our announcement page and it

1695
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,960
has both texts and you can go there and

1696
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,640
see which one got swapped out for the

1697
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,940
other one

1698
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:27,319
so let's skip that page

1699
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,119
um one of the things we've been doing is

1700
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:33,059
uh restructuring the ietf trust from a

1701
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,280
Virginia trust over into a

1702
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,280
not-for-profit corporation uh the this

1703
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,140
has largely been done because there's

1704
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,140
been some problems emerge in the trust

1705
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,359
operating one of the big problems was

1706
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,880
that insurance that we have to carry on

1707
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,200
our trustees because if you're a trustee

1708
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,299
you carry a lot of personal liability uh

1709
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:53,040
because you literally are signing up to

1710
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,200
have great your legal responsibility for

1711
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,420
these assets you carry a lot of legal

1712
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,460
you know liability around you and so we

1713
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,200
carry Insurance on everybody the trouble

1714
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,359
is we can't increase that amount of

1715
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,680
insurance the marketplace is very

1716
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,960
difficult for trust to get insurance and

1717
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,819
so after some analysis we said well one

1718
01:04:08,819 --> 01:04:10,799
way to sell that is to convert trustees

1719
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,440
from trustees to directors on a board of

1720
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,660
a corporation they're both not for not

1721
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,700
for profits trust us currently the new

1722
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,700
one will be too uh but this is a huge

1723
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,020
problem and it was a lot of people said

1724
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,640
I won't be a trustee because of that

1725
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,559
liability and a lot of Trustees worry

1726
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:26,819
about this

1727
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,920
that's work that's continuing to 2023

1728
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,119
I'll show you another slide where we're

1729
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:31,319
at right now

1730
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:33,299
uh if you want to find more information

1731
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:34,920
about this stuff in the consultation

1732
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,359
process we went through it was about two

1733
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:37,559
month thing we did earlier this year

1734
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,720
Eagle trustee website and there's videos

1735
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,920
and stuff like that you can see the

1736
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,380
whole thing play out uh discussions and

1737
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,700
how we work through and thought through

1738
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,200
the process

1739
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,540
uh One update when we did that process

1740
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,359
we had been told by the state of

1741
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,980
Delaware that they were totally cool

1742
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,020
with us calling the new Corporation the

1743
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,140
ITF trust which we thought okay it's a

1744
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,220
trust that's going to be a corporation

1745
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,079
that can be a little confusing that's

1746
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,540
why we asked permission up front when we

1747
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,160
actually went and found that Articles of

1748
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,140
Incorporation they came back and said

1749
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,180
what that's crazy you can't have a

1750
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,619
corporation it's a trust those are two

1751
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:13,260
different things so we went oh okay well

1752
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,260
we did ask you but all right so uh We've

1753
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,480
chosen a new name it's actually uh

1754
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,880
called the ITF intellectual property

1755
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,040
management Corporation I try to get just

1756
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,500
call it you know ITF IP but people

1757
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,339
thought there might be a little

1758
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:30,660
confusion with itfip and IP I don't know

1759
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,280
um maybe you know we kind of called the

1760
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,619
v-necks I don't know anyhow so that

1761
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:36,119
thing but

1762
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:37,500
the way we're going to thread this

1763
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,599
needle is we're going to take the we

1764
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,000
have taken the name ITF trust and

1765
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,599
Blended them back in to the uh bylaws

1766
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,099
and the other materials are on the

1767
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:48,839
corporation and so what's going to

1768
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:50,280
really happen is that we as the

1769
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,900
community can continue calling us the

1770
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,359
ITF trust the documentation we have will

1771
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:56,579
refer to it and even the a corporate

1772
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:59,339
article material will refer to it says

1773
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:01,559
the IHF trust also known as this other

1774
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:02,940
thing so we're never really going to

1775
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,799
call it this name amongst flight company

1776
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,240
we're always going to be addressed

1777
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,920
so this is where we're at the process we

1778
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,500
did the community consultation back in

1779
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,839
between May and July we decided to go

1780
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,400
proceed forward

1781
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,000
we filed uh the paperwork to go off and

1782
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,920
do it that was done just after itf1 14.

1783
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,359
so the next thing that's happening right

1784
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,059
now is we're finalizing this corporate

1785
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:32,280
spinning up we're dealing with things

1786
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,660
like hey you can't call yourself the

1787
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,220
iitf trust Corporation because that's

1788
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,260
too confusing but we're hopeful it's

1789
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,059
going to get done very soon and right

1790
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:40,020
after that what we're going to do next

1791
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,579
is apply for the IRS 501c3 SAS which if

1792
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:46,980
you're familiar with IRS tax law which

1793
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,900
is an awesome thing to play you know

1794
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,460
hang around in

1795
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,799
um that gets us our not-for-profit

1796
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,380
status once that is approved the next

1797
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,579
thing is all are going to happen in

1798
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,660
parallel we're going to take the assets

1799
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,920
for the whole thing give them a new

1800
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,220
thing and say job well done

1801
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,020
if you would like to hear more about

1810
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,880
meeting it's a challenge so that's a

1811
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,140
little bit of fun I don't know how to

1812

1816
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,359
tell you how to get a hold of us thank

1817
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:38,538
you

1818
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,000
thank you Glenn and I will point out

1819
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,380
that if you remember this overview slide

1820
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,240
it has the error going from the trust to

1821
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,799
the planet

1822
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,480
um there's no dollar sign attached to

1823
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,799
that and that is one of the things that

1824
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:50,819
makes this unique because we license

1825
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:52,380
this stuff out freely and widely because

1826
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:53,940
we want to be our staff to be used by

1827
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,440
everybody right

1828
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,000
um since we're amongst friends here I

1829
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,380
will point out in the itu there's an

1830
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,760
error going back from the planet to the

1831
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,920
itu that I think has 30 million dollars

1832
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,960
on it or something like that so just you

1833
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,960
know we if you if you wonder why Jay is

1834
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,700
asking for money that that's one of the

1835
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,680
reasons because we don't have that Arrow

1836
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,660
from the planet coming our way quite as

1837
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,720
boldly as some other organizations do

1838
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,060
right which brings us to the itf-116

1839
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,520

year and it's been seven years since the

1881
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,179
last Yokohama meeting so they I think

1882
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:22,020
the same things has been changed uh from

1883
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,540
the previous Yokohama meeting so the but

1884
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,659
the meetings venue will be the uh the

1885
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:30,840
past new Pacific Conference Hall that is

1886
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,540
called the Pacific North that is no

1887
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,600
sentence of

1888
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,780
the old Pacific meeting space so that is

1889
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,520
a very nice space

1890
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,540
and the the next time the is this screen

1891
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,940
the last time there was the November but

1892
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,300
uh this time uh it is our spring so it's

1893
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,760
very good season for the achieve Rossum

1894
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,620
so I think you can enjoy the cherry

1895
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,840
blossom there of course as well as your

1896
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,420
productive meeting there

1897
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,739
so

1898
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:04,380
um and the uh as mentioned by the last

1899
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:08,219
uh we have several restrictions we still

1900
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:09,960
have several risk restrictions for the

1901
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,860
entry to Japan but the uh the uh the

1902
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,980
Restriction is lifted now so I think

1903

01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,239
information later before the meeting but

1907
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:30,179
I think the only match you can enter to

1908
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:32,880
Japan easily I hope

1909

1925
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,460
local industry as well well many of them

1926
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,159

1927
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,719
based in in Japan and I'm certainly

uh Jonathan Jonathan B Postell award I

1937

actually used to be a student at isi

1938
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,300
during the time when John was still

1939
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,159
there in the corner of his on the 11th

1940
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,260
floor I want to say and it was really at

1941
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,960
the time I didn't quite you know it was

1942
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,640
John he was always there you know he was

1943
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,460
excellent but it's sort of only after a

1944
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,780
certain number of years do you realize

1945
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,120
how impactful he really was and so an

1946
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,100
award was created in his name to honor

1947

the development of the internet and the

1970
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,380
and the deployment of the internet all

1971
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,520
over the world

1972

01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:24,000
to make this award this year I am very

1985
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,820
pleased to present this award to George

1986
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,239
Sadowski who is here with us tonight

1987
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:32,370
George has um

1988
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:38,640
[Applause]

1989
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,940
George has a very long history on on the

1990
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,040
internet and in uh in working with the

1991
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,780
internet but a particular note that I

1992
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,420
want to uh I want to raise here are his

1993
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,239
contributions to the um to the

1994
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:52,500
development of the internet around the

1995
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,780
world connectivity and in particular the

1996
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:58,199
development of the inet program at uh

1997
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:00,000
that what which was a sponsor by the

1998
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,440
internet Society early in the internet

1999
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,900
society's life so um George I would like

2000
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,880
to invite you to come up and say a few

2001
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,980
words while George is coming up I will

2002
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:11,760
say normally we present also a shiny um

2003
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,800
Crystal globe and so on and there's a

2004
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,080
monetary award that goes with this but

2005
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,060
um George lives not very far from our

2006
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,360
office in in Reston and it seemed like

2007
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,520
the worst example of trombone routing to

2008
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,960
bring it here in order to get him to

2009
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,179
take it back home so we thought that we

2010
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:29,460
would forego that um this time so George

2011
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,239
thank you so much

2012
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:39,260
thank you

2013
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:44,699
it's closer right if you have flights

2014
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:47,880
okay I don't uh thank you very much I'm

2015
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,400
really honored by this award and even

2016
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,460
the more so that it was Joe I was chosen

2017
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,440
on the basis of my relationship with my

2018
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,420
peers and their assessment of

2019
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,420
contributions but I think it's important

2020
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,060
to note that these workshops would not

2021
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,280
have been possible had it not been for

2022
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,920
many other volunteers we had about the

2023
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,860
workshops ran for 10 years and we had

2024
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,800
about 15 to 30 volunteers teaching

2025
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,219
administering Logistics etc for each

2026
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:20,340
year these people gave up two to three

2027
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,679
weeks and maybe more of their lives they

2028
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:24,719
developed curricula offline they did a

2029
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,520
number of other things offline they

2030
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,340
looked at student applications Etc and

2031
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:33,060
uh actually there may be some volunteers

2032
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,000
here I don't know the person I can think

2033
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,640
of is Randy Bush who may be here or may

2034
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,199
not be I don't know

2035
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:42,900
um just to as a historical note it's

2036
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:46,560
worth uh remembering that in 1992 when

2037
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,360
the first Workshop was being conducted

2038
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,340
Randy was run

2039
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,540
connectivity to several African

2040
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,900
countries through various 64 KB leased

2041
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,300
lines that terminated in his bedroom in

2042
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,640
Portland Oregon and then were connected

2043
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,280
to the internet

2044
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,080
that was the State of Affairs and one of

2045
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,699
the tracks we did took what we taught

2046
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:11,699
was how to connect your com your your

2047
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:14,940
country to the internet and one of the

2048
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,040
ways which was used was a protocol which

2049
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,140
I'm sure doesn't exist anymore slip

2050
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:22,440
which allowed dial-up uh uh connections

2051
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,540
to the internet this was the situation

2052
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,520
we were faced with and that was a time

2053
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,400
when digital bits went over analog lines

2054
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,820
and they're owned by telephone companies

2055
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,020
which situation which is totally

2056
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,380
reversed today so so those people

2057
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,020
deserve a lot of credit so why did we do

2058
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:40,940
this

2059
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,920
we didn't conceptualize it quite at this

2060
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,440
time quite like this at the time but but

2061
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,560
I think several of us Randy for sure I

2062
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,920
also had had experience with the working

2063
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,360
in developing countries and doing

2064
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,060
technology transfer and when you went

2065
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:59,699
into a developing country and I would

2066
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:01,620
always go to the university to see what

2067
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,540
kind of Technical Resources there were

2068
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,940
the University Library could often be

2069
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,460
fit in one room much much smaller than

2070
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,640
this room and the technical books might

2071
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,340
fit on two bookshelves and the

2072
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,920
networking and Computing bits might fit

2073
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:21,420
on one shelf or less so there was

2074
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:24,420
clearly a lack of information about

2075
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:27,060
developments and a lack of communication

2076
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,880
with colleagues

2077
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,560
we saw

2078
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,540
excuse me uh

2079
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:37,020
we saw evidence that there were problems

2080
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,940
that these people were facing in all

2081
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,980
countries and not only in the technology

2082
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:44,460
in in agricultural in Industry Etc and

2083
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,020
uh one of one of the definitions of

2084
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,000
information poverty is

2085
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,620
um you know you have a problem in these

2086
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,380
countries uh and you don't understand

2087
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,600
what exactly what kind of a problem it

2088
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,699
is you don't know whether the problem

2089
01:18:56,699 --> 01:19:00,480
has it is being uh met by anybody else

2090
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,300
in any other place you don't know how to

2091
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,719
find out uh you can't find out even if

2092
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,520
you knew you probably couldn't

2093
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,820
communicate with them because the uh you

2094
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,040
could use postal mail or you could use

2095
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:18,060
Telex 75 to 110 bits per second that was

2096
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,520
the original uh email

2097
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,159
and uh even if you knew who they were

2098
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,500
you couldn't contact them and you didn't

2099
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,179
have a way of getting the information

2100
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,840
you needed and even getting the uh the

2101
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,640
confidence that you that your problem

2102
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,640
had a solution you could find it so uh

2103
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,739
we saw this we saw the internet the

2104
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,020
emergence of the internet as a way of

2105
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,760
breaking down those communication

2106
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,360
barriers and that was the motivation and

2107
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,140
by god it worked uh the um

2108
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,860
the results were we had about 1500

2109
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,900
participants from almost all developing

2110
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,699
countries we did not succeed in getting

2111
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:59,100
anybody from North Korea

2112
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,840
and I'm sure we missed some of the

2113
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,640
smaller Island countries in the Pacific

2114
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,980
but by and large we got people from all

2115
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:08,159
over the world uh even the uh especially

2116
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,500
the Russian uh former the former Soviet

2117
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,020
Union countries George Soros contributed

2118
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,580
a lot uh to us to uh to make that happen

2119
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:21,540
uh we developed world leaders in Telecom

2120
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,880
and in the internet we I think there are

2121
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,179
four of our students became Ministers of

2122
01:20:26,179 --> 01:20:28,699
communication and information technology

2123
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:31,980
uh two of them uh uh well one of them

2124
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,739
Tara camel in Egypt was a major force in

2125
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:36,900
developing the internet in Africa uh

2126
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:40,860
Nick weiner from Ghana uh an equally uh

2127
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,900
powerful force tariq's no longer with us

2128
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,719
when he is working today uh and he

2129
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:47,940
didn't become a minister because he

2130
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,040
thought it was probably better for him

2131
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,020
to stay with his own uh company he was

2132
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,780
asked uh to become one and uh he turned

2133
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:58,739
it down uh there are also uh people in

2134
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:02,520
the private sector in ngos uh who were

2135
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,340
leaders now in their countries but were

2136
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:08,699
our students and they developed a

2137
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:10,920
network early on a network of email

2138
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,739
which as soon as they could have it uh

2139
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:15,900
by which they reinforce their own

2140
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,420
concerns and solve problems in that

2141
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,239
email Network grew very substantially

2142
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:23,699
over the course of the workshops

2143
01:21:23,699 --> 01:21:27,659
um so isoc played a critical role in

2144
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:32,219
that the idea came in 1992 in Kobe I

2145
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:34,440
remember going to land Larry Larry

2146
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,320
landweber and saying look we can do this

2147
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,320
uh we can we can develop this we can get

2148
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,239
people we can train them we can send

2149
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,640
them back and it was an ill-formed

2150
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,580
concept it had no uh guarantees of

2151
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,100
success Larry said here's fifty thousand

2152
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,679
dollars you raise the rest and uh do it

2153
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:56,100
and we did it and uh as a result of that

2154
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,140
success we continued for the next eight

2155
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:01,500
or nine years uh they um the internet

2156
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,600
Society quickly took the program under

2157
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,540
its own Aegis uh and provided the

2158
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,520
support and the encouragement and the

2159
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,159
backing that was required for us to

2160
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,340
continue in 1992 there was almost no

2161
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,199
place that you could go in the world to

2162
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:18,420
get formal training in internet if you

2163
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,880
were in a developing country we phased

2164
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,760
out the workshops in 2001 when there had

2165
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,620
been enough critical mass formed in the

2166
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,199
regions and in a lot of the countries so

2167
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:31,140
that they were no longer necessary so

2168
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,940
this was one of the more important

2169
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:35,060
things that I've done in my life I think

2170
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,400
and I really am glad I did it but thank

2171
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,550
you very much

2172
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:48,580
[Applause]

2173
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,340
thank you George this is very well

2174
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,219
deserved and and I I think the sort of

2175
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:57,600
spirit from the early days of dinner and

2176
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,640
it's still around right sort of um just

2177
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,219
sort of doing creative things to solve

2178
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:04,320
problems to bring people together and

2179
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,000
and thinking broadly and and just

2180
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,699
bringing different people in is I think

2181
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:10,500
what's still around and it's good as it

2182
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,760
is

2183
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,580
right which brings me to another slide

2184
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:17,420
that has George on it

2185
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,199
he said you said you didn't have any I

2186
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,540
guess it was Andrew's anyway this is a

2187
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:22,800
very nice photo of you though by the way

2188
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,020
I'm glad we get to show it

2189
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:27,360
um and that brings us to the IAB Open

2190
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,440
Mic

2191
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,120
um so if you're an IB member and if

2192
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,100
you're here please come up

2193
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,199
let's see miria I see some others and if

2194
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:36,420
you have a question for the IAB

2195
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,159
um there's a QR code if you could scan

2196
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,780
it so that we can put you into the

2197
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,460
virtual queue if you're remote and if

2198
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:43,140
you want to ask a question to the IB or

2199
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,659
any of the other open mics later on you

2200
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:47,880
know you can get into the queue and then

2201
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,219
we will uh call you and ask you to

2202
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:52,260
unmute and show us your video if you

2203
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,040
like

2204
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,960
and so far the queue is empty and mirror

2205
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,420
is going to take over

2206
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,080
hi again

2207
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,580
we'll do a round of interact

2208
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,600
Ive and try to see everybody on the

2209
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,400
slides

2210
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,540
um but

2211
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,760
we'll keep the mask on in good tradition

2212
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,040
here so if you actually want to see more

2213
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,199
of the IB without mask the full face you

2214
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:17,340
have to ask some questions because

2215
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,620
that's the occasion where you take off

2216
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,420
the mask but we do a round of

2217
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,920

01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,040
that Deborah Burger

2241
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,120
great to have you both here joining us

2242
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:39,239
remotely okay now it's your chance for

2243
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:43,820
questions oh wait Pete ah there

2244
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:48,300
hi all Pete Resnick

2245
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,239
um so when you posted the announcement

2246
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:54,120
for Warren taking over the liaison it

2247
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,400
caused the conversation and I thought I

2248
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,940
meant to send email but you're all here

2249
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,159
um I want to encourage you to do more

2250
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:05,040
with Liaisons in particular when you

2251
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,080
made the announcement it would have been

2252
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,300
great to not only have that he was doing

2253
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,100
this and Allison was stepping down but

2254
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,500
what that liaison's about why it's still

2255
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,360
important to keep because I assume you

2256
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,480
folks review them every so often

2257
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,639
um Warren happens to be an AED and I

2258
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,880
know we generally don't assign liaison

2259
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,440
ads to be Liaisons because of possible

2260
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,780
conflicts of interest why that was an

2261
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,520
okay thing

2262
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,920
um so I think that would be a great you

2263
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,780
know opportunity every time you make a

2264
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,280
change to let us know what's going on

2265
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,800
but I also encourage you talk to some

2266
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,260
working groups when they're doing work

2267
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:43,500
that impacts the asons and kind of let

2268
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,540
people know that you're there would be

2269
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,840
really a good thing over the long term

2270
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,760
so actually that feedback reached us

2271
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,840
already

2272
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,060
so we're aware of that

2273
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,440
um I want to say a couple of things I

2274
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,540
think I'm we already know that we can we

2275
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:58,800
can prove the information we provide

2276
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,420
about liaison so that's something we are

2277
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,699
working on and as always the IEP is slow

2278
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:05,400
on this but we are working on that

2279
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,620
um the other thing is um we actually

2280
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:10,320
didn't really consider to kind of taking

2281
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,380
liaison down because that might give a

2282
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,060
wrong signal to the other organization

2283
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,800
right so this is like something that has

2284
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,120
to be treated very carefully so we

2285
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,580
usually try to replace people but it's

2286
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,620
also not that easy to find people in the

2287
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,780
space because we need experts that are

2288
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,040
kind of knowledgeable in both

2289
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,880
organizations so the set is very limited

2290
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,480
um and but gladly a lot of the Leo songs

2291
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,820
are actually working very well

2292
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,020
um and then to your third point about

2293
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,639
working groups it's but it's not always

2294
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,920
required to heavily official years not

2295
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,540
to do good work we actually encourage

2296
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,239
people to just like work on a technical

2297
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:47,639
basis and talk to each other because

2298
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:49,560
that gives us the best outcome the cases

2299
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,540
where we have leosource there is some

2300
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,159
kind of formal requirement where we

2301
01:27:53,159 --> 01:27:55,020
otherwise cannot access certain

2302
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,300
documents in the other organization or

2303
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,860
where it's just like the process of the

2304
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,719
organization is that like requires this

2305
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,159
kind of process so it does not usually

2306
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,199
come from our side from our side we just

2307
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:05,760
usually try to work together and do good

2308
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,320
work that's the main incentive

2309
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,900
um so Pete thanks for the question it's

2310
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,840
a good one um I I think in the process

2311
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,120
of revamping the liaison uh coordination

2312
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,739
role in the last couple years you know

2313
01:28:22,739 --> 01:28:24,179
we've made a lot of positive changes and

2314
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:25,679
we're not done yet

2315
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,080
um a couple of ones to point out one is

2316
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,300
in fact this IAB open was the first time

2317
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,520
where we actually had a presentation

2318
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,520
from a liaison manager about what that

2319
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,320
organization was and it was about IEEE

2320
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,440
thank you so well you can thank Russ it

2321
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,880
was a really good one second time okay

2322
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,860
second time we are trying to do that

2323
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,199
every IAB open assuming you know there's

2324
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:48,120
there's time on the agenda to do so but

2325
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,739
that's actually a high priority for us

2326
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:52,800
because of exactly what you said right

2327
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,239
um I have learned a lot in the last

2328
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,760
couple years as liaison coordinator the

2329
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,080
vast number of things that we have

2330
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,120
relationships with and more about them

2331
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,040
and I'm not done learning myself so

2332
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,120
there's a lot to learn and we're

2333
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,920
continuing to ramp that up so expect to

2334
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,139
see more of that in the future

2335
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:09,480
um one of the other things that we're

2336
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,000
doing a lot of lately is asking people

2337
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,179
in those roles who are the other ietf

2338
01:29:15,179 --> 01:29:17,400
members that might be participating in

2339
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,620
both organizations so that we can sort

2340
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,480
of start building a list of and

2341
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,820
understanding who is who is available to

2342
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,679
fill these positions in the case of

2343
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:26,880
Warren he was actually the only person

2344
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,800
that volunteered we didn't we did make a

2345
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,719
call for volunteers and Warren's like

2346
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,460
I'll do it if nobody else does so you

2347
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,260
know Warren got the job

2348
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,920
um that there are a couple of of

2349
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,540
organizations that are much more remote

2350
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,120
and uh less familiar I mean Russ talked

2351
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,620
about IEEE today and I think most people

2352
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,600
here at least have some knowledge about

2353
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,000
IEEE whereas some of the other

2354
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,040
organizations that's not true and so our

2355
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,960
goal is to continue that education over

2356
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,159
time so thank you for the question

2357
01:29:55,699 --> 01:29:58,679
a quick point from from the IHF side of

2358
01:29:58,679 --> 01:29:59,520
things

2359
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,219
um so obviously iib establishes manages

2360
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:03,540
these relationships but they're critical

2361
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:06,480
to the work of the of the iatf right and

2362
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,100
um for some of these organizations

2363
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,900
especially sort of the the more formal

2364
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,840
older sdos right they're quite difficult

2365
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,880
to establish and and once you have one

2366
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,739
it's worth holding on to it even though

2367
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:18,120
it might go dormant for a little while

2368
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,940
because sometimes it can take a long

2369
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,620
time to get it back and if you need it

2370
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,139
and you don't have it right it's a

2371
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:26,460
little bit like an insurance kind of

2372
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,040
thing right so so it's it's not a bad

2373
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,800
thing if a liaison is is quiet for a

2374
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,540
while right it's probably actually a

2375
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:34,860
good thing

2376
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,719
um but but giving it up as you mentioned

2377
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,760
that right it is a is a very deliberate

2378
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,139
choice and we need to be very careful

2379
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:42,840
that that when we do that

2380
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,719
foreign

2381
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,739
okay then we take the next question

2382
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:49,040
Andrew

2383
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:58,280
why thank you uh

2384
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,679
uh Andrew camping um

2385
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,500
I think it was really

2386
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:08,159
it was great to see the recent uh M10 uh

2387
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,780
Workshop

2388
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,639
um although I could politely say it's

2389
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:13,560
nearly nine years after the publication

2390
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:17,219
RFC es 7258

2391
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:21,000
um so great to see it but maybe

2392
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,280
could be done quite a few years earlier

2393
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,620
and I wonder is there a mechanism for

2394
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:27,840
the community to sort of identify things

2395
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,179
where the IB can help get ahead of the

2396
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:33,239
curve in considering sort of big

2397
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:36,120
significant architecture issues to give

2398
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:39,060
direction uh rather than sort of

2399
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,520
catching up what can we do to help with

2400
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,860
that thank you

2401
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:45,600
join the IB

2402
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,659
um

2403
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,940
um so I think that the one tool um that

2404
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,440
we use like actually they're multiple

2405
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,699
tools that we use to engage with the

2406
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:55,380
community but the one that is like the

2407
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,880
the most predominant is that we have

2408
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,100
these iav programs which we try to set

2409
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,960
up on topics where we think like a

2410
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,940
discussion with the IRB

2411
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:05,159
um is needed but I also have to admit

2412
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:07,980
that what the IEP is driving also

2413
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,199
depends a little bit on the members on

2414
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:14,280
the IAB of course and and we are we are

2415
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,719
trying to or like the Nom come is

2416
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:17,040
actually doing a great job trying to

2417
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,620
cover broad expertise on the IRB but

2418
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,020
that always influences on where we're

2419
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:23,880
focusing on because we also just have

2420
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,159
limited capacity of course so I'm not

2421
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:27,659
sure that answers your question but

2422
01:32:27,659 --> 01:32:29,670
there are more people here

2423
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:30,860
[Music]

2424
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:35,340
yeah so um one way is to send us email

2425
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,080
um and there's some recent examples like

2426
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,840
this uh uh environmental impacts

2427
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,880
Workshop that we're Now setting up for

2428
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,139
for next month

2429
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:46,139
um that actually came about uh through

2430
01:32:46,139 --> 01:32:48,540
several channels so there was some IED

2431
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,040
members who were interested about it

2432
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,739
about a topic we thought this was

2433
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:55,500
important uh it was seen as uh in some

2434
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,960
parts of the industry as as uh you know

2435
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,600
an important issue to solve but we also

2436
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,820
got uh

2437
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:04,440
uh connections from from other people

2438
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,659
outside the IAB a totally different

2439
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:09,179
groups who were thinking about this and

2440
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:11,880
and were proposing a workshop on on this

2441
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,400
this topic so we put our uh efforts

2442
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,219
together and uh now we are looking

2443
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:18,540
forward to a very interesting workshop

2444
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:21,719
with uh 30 or so papers submitted from

2445
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:24,239
different angles so

2446
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,820
talk to us and uh it's not always tested

2447
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:28,920
but like what I'm interested in right

2448
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,780
now I might actually be interested after

2449
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,520
you explain that this is important for

2450
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,739
these and these reasons and then I and

2451
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:36,840
other IAB members would get into that

2452
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,600
and uh yeah we'd like to hear from you

2453
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,340
thank you

2454
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:42,540
[Music]

2455
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:47,159
yep so one other quick point is we try

2456
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:49,320
and have workshops where we believe that

2457
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,540
progress can be made and and a lot of

2458
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:52,800
times if there's already progress

2459
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,719
happening in the industry it doesn't

2460
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,219
make sense for us to hold something when

2461
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:57,300
there's already a lot of other stuff

2462
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,159
going on or there's other times it's

2463
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:00,780
often too early that we don't think

2464
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,100
progress can be made because the

2465
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,659
technology is not there yet so getting

2466
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:05,820
that timing rate has been a struggle and

2467
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,960
we've we've thought about many other

2468
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,520
workshops that we have not actually put

2469
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,199
out because it didn't seem like it was

2470
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:12,060
the right time or or there it wasn't

2471
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,380
going to be a productive conversation

2472
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:15,179
I'm very happy that the last few went

2473
01:34:15,179 --> 01:34:18,260
off so so well so

2474
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,699

please go ahead are you in the room I

2549

think yes I'm here hi hi this is your

2550
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:53,659
name so my question

2551
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:57,199
my question is I don't think this is uh

2552
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:00,900
iesg responsible things but I'd like to

2553
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,860
hear the mood of this community

2554
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:07,560
uh so few days ago there was a new

2555
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:10,020
mailing list announcement that the name

2556
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:15,120
of a story entering AG so I wonder what

2557
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:19,560
kind of story we are collecting for this

2558
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:23,280
ETF especially for the local uh story

2559
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,600
things because as a Yokohama resident

2560
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,600
I'd like to talk about something about

2561
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,060
Yokohama

2562
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:37,380
for the next year but if uh what kind of

2563
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:41,880
story are you are willing to know for

2564
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,400
example if you want to see cherry

2565
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:49,280
blossoms I'd like to introduce

2566
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:52,260
which is a very famous place where uh

2567
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,739
something like that or very old story

2568
01:38:55,739 --> 01:38:59,100
like reclaiming of the Oklahoma and such

2569
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,600
things so uh

2570
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:05,460
yeah so I directly thanks for the

2571
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,960
question so this is a non-working group

2572
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,940
mailing list which which is not

2573
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:11,100
technically under the purview of the isg

2574
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,780
other than we approve it and we are very

2575
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,520
generously improving almost anything but

2576
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,960
I think we have a moderator or the

2577
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,639
initiator of the list of slowly walking

2578
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:20,520
up to microphones so Adrian can tell you

2579
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,920
exactly what the list is for

2580
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,560
yeah hi I'm Adrian Farrell

2581
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,739
um uh we asked for this list this was uh

2582
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:32,280
Olo Johansson and I asked for this list

2583
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:36,120
um under I think Warren's care as sort

2584
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:39,300
of supervisor of uh affiliate groups the

2585
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,340
purpose of this type of mailing list is

2586
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,100
just to bring people together from the

2587
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,320
community have a shared interest so like

2588
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,659
there's a list for people who go running

2589
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:52,860
God help them uh and uh

2590
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:57,360
um we have an interest in uh stories uh

2591
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:00,060
all are particularly storytelling me

2592
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,699
writing stories and we are just

2593
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,980
interested to see if there are people

2594
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:08,400
who like stories sharing stories and one

2595
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,699
possible thread to all this is stories

2596
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:14,159
about the history of the internet and

2597
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:17,639
the ietf that we're aware maybe getting

2598
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:21,060
lost uh in time and it might be fun to

2599
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,139
collect

2600
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:24,239
you should definitely talk to Mrs

2601
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:26,040
Sandusky over there I think there will

2602
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,620
be plenty of stories for you to start on

2603
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,540
and yeah thank you

2604
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,820
um so seeing as you talk about affiliate

2605
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,500
groups a quick bit of background on him

2606
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:37,560
we all spend a lot of time together like

2607
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,420
a couple of weeks a year

2608
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,520
and it seems silly to me that we don't

2609
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,260
have a way to sort of find other people

2610
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,239
in the ITF Community with shared

2611
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,580
interests so that's kind of the purpose

2612
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:49,560
of affiliate groups if you're interested

2613
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,480
in something you know and you think

2614
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,639
there are other people in the ietf and

2615
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:55,440
you want to form sort of a social group

2616
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,940
or a way to find each other and

2617
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:59,280
self-organize that's the purpose of

2618
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,620
affiliate groups they're linked

2619
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,960
somewhere in data tracker if you search

2620
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,520
for ietf affiliate groups you'll find

2621
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,800
the page and you know we would like

2622
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,540
there to be a community of people

2623
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,520
interested in the topic and they're

2624
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,199
really easy to set up it's basically a

2625
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:15,480
mailing list and then whoever organizes

2626
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,940
it sort of makes sure that it's

2627
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:20,280
um doing something and people are being

2628
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,020
friendly and

2629
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:25,460
and personable and that's it

2630
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,150
yeah I just wanted to thank you

2631
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:28,980
[Music]

2632
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:31,260
because this reminds us that we as a

2633
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,239
community should be telling stories like

2634
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:35,580
we should together have good experience

2635
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,880
and and work as a community and um I

2636
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,679
think that was your intention of coming

2637
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:42,179
to the mic so thank you for reminding us

2638
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:44,400
for that I'll also point out reading

2639
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,020
some of the drafts I think we often are

2640
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:48,860
telling stories

2641
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:53,718
let's not make the useful one

2642
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,619
is a remote I believe could you start

2643
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:01,080
your video and ask a question please

2644
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:06,719
yes uh do you hear me yes

2645
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:11,520
I've uh hello I have asked a question

2646
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,000
before regarding uh

2647
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,780
uh uh the cross layering or let the

2648
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:21,380
cross cross area documents

2649
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:26,639
uh and I'm interested to know uh uh how

2650
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,840
the ad or the director for each area uh

2651
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:34,679
deals with uh with uh active documents

2652
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:38,820
which may uh become in the future uh

2653
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:42,900
interrelated to other working groups uh

2654
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:47,100
and uh and and how do they uh between

2655
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:50,639
them how do they work together to make

2656
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:55,199
uh uh a better standard as as I have

2657
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:58,679
seen some a new working group is uh uh

2658
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:02,639
is established as uh let's say Computing

2659
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,420
aware or let's say a routing protocol is

2660
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:10,100
aware of another uh uh

2661
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:15,840
other protocol or another uh layer so uh

2662
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:19,520
there is some cross cross uh

2663
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,040
uh area

2664
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:26,340
issues here so could you just give me

2665
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:29,880
some uh maybe between uh or one of you

2666
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:34,460
can give me some uh uh uh sure

2667
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:36,540
there's often different approaches right

2668
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,940
so so and some new work like squarely

2669
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:40,500
fits into one area and there's no need

2670
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,179
to really discuss you know whether TCP

2671
01:43:42,179 --> 01:43:43,980
work belongs in transport

2672
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:45,420
um but for things that cross the area it

2673
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,040
gets interesting as you note right and

2674
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,480
there's a bunch of different ways in

2675
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,980
which we do this like one principle for

2676
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,020
example is that you look at

2677
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:54,360
um where are the harder problems right

2678
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:55,980
so for example if it's a thing between

2679
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:58,860
like say security and transport we would

2680
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:00,900
say you know is the security side the

2681
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:03,000
heart thing or is the transport side and

2682
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,500
so we would sort of probably then place

2683
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,600
it with the area

2684
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,100
um where we believe the harder problems

2685
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,619
lie so that those experts have it a bit

2686
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:12,360
more visible on their radar as they look

2687
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,100
at work groups and agendas but there's

2688
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:16,380
other principles and and I see Eric has

2689
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:19,380
a stand up yeah basically first notice

2690
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:22,159
that the areas are not isolated silos

2691
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:24,900
and guess what ads talks to each other

2692
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,600
but basically they're also directorates

2693
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,540
pretty mad that like young any working

2694
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,580
group share can request a young

2695
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:34,440
directorate's review or DNS directorate

2696
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,540
review which I'm sure already some kind

2697
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:39,900
of cross area relationships and quite

2698
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,239
often we when we spot this when we talk

2699
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,699
with chairs as an idea I understand that

2700
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:47,219
the chairs have some document in my

2701
01:44:47,219 --> 01:44:49,980
areas my working group say oh please

2702
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:52,199
request the working group last call to

2703
01:44:52,199 --> 01:44:54,239
also be said and forward it to another

2704
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:57,239
working group and essentially some

2705
01:44:57,239 --> 01:45:00,360
you say cross area collaboration we even

2706
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,400
within an area so there are multiple

2707
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,080
ways of doing it

2708
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,719
Warren yeah I mean Eric covered a lot of

2709
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:09,480
it already but there's also sort of when

2710
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,760
new work starts up we try and have Buffs

2711
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,320
and we try and schedule them when sort

2712
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:15,000
of lots of people can show up so we

2713
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,980
share that information

2714
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:18,960
um or says Eric said you know 80s chat

2715
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,460
amongst themselves a lot especially

2716
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:22,800
about cross area stuff we're also trying

2717
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,540
to do things like the technology deep

2718
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:26,880
Dives things to try and sort of get more

2719
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,920
discussion between areas and make sure

2720
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,420
that we don't end up quite as much in

2721
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:34,040
silos and Murray

2722
01:45:34,219 --> 01:45:37,980
I'm very strict about the queues

2723
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,659
add on all the other techniques we've

2724
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:41,159
already talked about we've had a lot of

2725
01:45:41,159 --> 01:45:44,760
success in planning up front and we do

2726
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,040
that into two ways so Lars had alluded

2727
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,360
to this idea of where is the problem

2728
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,659
harder we we have a tendency to send the

2729
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:53,880
send it to that area but we even have a

2730
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,100
further refinement of that is to make

2731
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,420
sure we get that cross-area

2732
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,219
collaboration and the work is seen by

2733
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:01,739
both areas we often assign an area

2734
01:46:01,739 --> 01:46:04,619
director outside of the the place where

2735
01:46:04,619 --> 01:46:06,659
it's home we have a couple examples we

2736
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:08,520
recently weren't sure we're Tigris there

2737
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,920
were issues to consider in art there are

2738
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,980
issues in sex so it is in uh it is

2739
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,420
housed in the art area but there's a

2740
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,520
responsible SEC A.D we've done that with

2741
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,860
things like skim we've done it with Ojai

2742
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,380
so this model kind of works in planning

2743
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,239
up front in that another mechanism we

2744
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,460
use to plan up front is to think through

2745
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,800
when we Charter to explicitly build into

2746
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,719
the structural it's the structural

2747
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,040
considerations of the working group

2748
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,780
about what other working groups and

2749
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:35,820
whether it's ITF or even kind of

2750
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:37,260
Liaisons and Partnerships we need to

2751
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:38,940
think about upfront and then we name

2752
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:40,380
kind of parties based on how things are

2753
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:43,020
chartered right

2754
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:46,619
you covered Murray's case Rob

2755
01:46:46,619 --> 01:46:48,840
another example we have is working

2756
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,880
groups like The iot Ops working group

2757
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,800
we're sort of covering a technology area

2758
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,600
that spans multiple working groups in

2759
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,340
the ITF and the purpose of that working

2760
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,320
group is it necessarily to produce lots

2761
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,119
of documents to act as like a

2762
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:01,380
coordination point between the working

2763
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:03,540
groups and communication point between

2764
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:04,679
the different sorts of work that's

2765
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:06,179
happening elsewhere so that's another

2766
01:47:06,179 --> 01:47:07,619
example of how we try and solve this

2767
01:47:07,619 --> 01:47:09,840
sort of cross cross area across working

2768
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,619
group problems

2769
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:15,679
okay I hope that answered the question

2770
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:19,280
are there other questions

2771
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:26,820
okay we are 13 minutes early thank you

2772
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:28,199
very much for spending your evening with
