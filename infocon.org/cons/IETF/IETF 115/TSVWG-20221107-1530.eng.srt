also speaking of the Mike Q This is a

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,900
hybrid meeting therefore the mic Q is

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,000
what's up there on the screen if you are

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,759

documents that could use some careful

100
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,280
review are multi-path uh dccp and the

101
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
UDP options drafts

102
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,800
all right time for a review of our

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,979
greatest hits nrc's published since ietf

104
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,919
114 but there are three drafts at the

105
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,639
art all three l4s drafts are at the RFC

106
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,919
editor they are being actively worked on

107

they will appear in the very near future

108
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,300
I think we're closing in on uh what's

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,699
needed to get them published no drafts

110

irresponsible group chair uh the issue

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,460
encapsulation for the lower layer

116
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,220
protocols and ECM for tunnels that use

117
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,319
shim headers uh we're working through

118
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,780
the revised reframing interaction text

119
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,180
for that first draft using captivation

120
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,880
for lower layer protocols with luck that

121
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,919
will con that will close fairly soon and

122

one draft just completed a second

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,740
working group last call is signing a new

126

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,880
Greg is going to discuss uh where we are

130
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,979
on that one

131
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,560
um here are the remaining six drafts the

132
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,780
first five drafts are on the agenda the

133
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,419
sixth one use reports for experiments is

134
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,080
a fairly small mostly processed draft uh

135
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,460
the draft itself is complete it's going

136
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,020

137

attention what we do you'll notice sctp

141
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,400
Nat is missing from a list above uh we

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,660
decided the right thing to do was remove

143
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,000
it from our plan of work because we

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
could not get uh convergence and

145
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,039
agreement on what that what that draft

146
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,539
ought to do

147
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,419
okay bunch of related drafts these are

148
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,699

151
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,340

152
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,639
control guidance draft uh Martin Duke

153
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,500
has found a case that we appear to have

154
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,840
missed in uh ecn interaction with

155
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,639
tunnels so there's an indoor draft on

156
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,620
that and careful resumption of

157

they'll be timed out the end to go into

174
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,520
it much more detail but we'll have to

175
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,140
see we're trying to run what would

176
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,880
normally be a three hour meeting in two

177
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,240
hours and so uh things are tight and

178
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,240
John has a draft on media headache

179
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,500
extension for wireless networks which

180
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,260
has been uh discussed some on the list

181
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,660
and if you're on that list of people

182

when we show yours one slide you have

184
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,700
two minutes to present your topic as and

185
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,160
encourage people to read those drafts uh

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,260
just two minutes in total and that will

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,620

record Milestones it says still about to

191
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
be achieved because I thought these were

192
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,180
almost done in Philadelphia I still

193
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,860

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,399

whatever it was you were concerned about

217

just seen uh chairs update so I've we've

221
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,940

222
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,220
status we've reviewed the uh status

223
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,440
shelf first drafts at the RFC editor

224
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
expect to actually be rfcs very soon

225
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,820
it's been a long strange trip but we got

226
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,600
there

227
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,339
uh and the status active working group

228
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,300
drafts

229
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,760
we then have a couple of group drafts on

230
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,200

231
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,380
um DHCP assignment considerations which

232
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,000
it has gone through our group last call

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,339
we have some comments resolve the lfs

234
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,019
operational guidance which Greg White's

235
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,459
going to talk about a little bit uh that

236
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,040
one's going to stick around for a while

237
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,980
moving on transport drafts uh two

238
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,740
sessions on multi-path dccp there's been

239
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,779
some interop testing and I hear the

240
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,120
results a bit have been pretty good uh

241
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,740
and then Marcus will talk about the base

242
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,040
multi-path DCC D CCP draft

243
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,440
John Matson has taken over SCP

244
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
authentication and found let's see I

245
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
think we could politely call it some

246
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,839
opportunities for improvement uh Michael

247
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,399
tookson is going to talk about what to

248
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,380
do about those opportunities

249
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Magnus has our latest details of sctp

250
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,380
draft and then we have the two uh UDP

251
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,079

252
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,940

256
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,560
don't don't actually pronounce that uh

257
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,980
uh uh supporting UDP options uh gory is

258
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,200
that yours at Tom Jones

259
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,579
um they're both going to be dealt with

260
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,899
the same way all right

261
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,519
okay uh individual drafts

262
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,240
um sctp UDP uh update

263
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
um proposed by ctps or checksum

264
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,860
um Nicholas is going to talk about

265
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,019
uh Carefree junk careful resumption

266
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,420
congestion control gory is going to talk

267
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,040
about a general draft on guidelines and

268
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,899
recognition control and as I mentioned

269
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,899
earlier uh Martin Duke has found a case

270
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,820
that we a case of EC internal

271
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,019
interaction that appears not to be

272
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,579
addressed as an angel draft to address

273
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,980
it then down at the end of the meeting

274
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,139
at the end of item five is normally two

275
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,459
hours of gender time if we get through

276
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,959
this more quickly we'll have time down

277
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,139
at the end to do uh hpcc plus plus

278
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,260
Michael has uh at least one other sctp

279
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,500
draft John has a metadata draft uh on

280
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,899
meditative media packets and finally

281
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,519
ingomar has a 5G radio scheduling l4s no

282
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,959
draft he's also going to talk about that

283
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,360
in iccrg so it's not essential that we

284
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,620
get to it but it's certainly usually

285
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,279
have a heads up here

286
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,500
okay we need to get through some cherish

287
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,600
topics administ trivia time uh liaison

288
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,160
Communications so I'll start the third

289
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,800
liaison came a while ago uh it's been

290
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,240
dealt with

291
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,800
um and nothing has been heard from wa

292
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,320
since we sent the reply back in essence

293
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,940
what had happened is a an interest

294
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,339
individual draft to come here saying hey

295
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,459
let's go to find phbs and dscps for

296
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,620
every 5qi we can think of

297
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,320
uh to which our response was uh that's a

298
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,420
lot of dhcps not sure we're going to be

299
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,000
using that many and oh by the way 3gpp

300
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,519
really does not like what you're doing

301
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,980
uh a liaison came from WBA said hey

302
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,959
would you please do this once a response

303
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,519
went back was uh that consumed a whole

304
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,320
lot of dscps how about something fewer

305
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
and would you please get along with 3gpp

306
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,339
and get back to us nothing has been

307
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,260
heard from wwba since I think we can

308
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,639
retire this uh this liaison

309
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,399
so we have a liaison with 3gpp relating

310
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,279
to a CTP and dtls

311
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,860
and this will come up in the liaison

312
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,019
discussion uh tomorrow where we do the

313
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,600
coordination and it may be updated if we

314
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,940
need to after this meeting we will see

315
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,300
how all this goes and gsma liaison has

316
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,839
your name against the world as well

317
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,240
yeah gsma are aware of the multi-path

318
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,560
dccp work and this touches with a 3gpp

319
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,220
and gsma work on

320
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,560
uh on the multi-path dccp work really

321
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,579
and keep going next one's yours too

322
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,519
all right um

323
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,399
this is uh iepg presentation on dscp

324
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,260
measurement is where Anna presented her

325
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,779
data if you didn't see it you missed it

326
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,760
put it still in the archive so you can

327
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
go and look at it or speak to Anna at

328
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,979
this meeting

329
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,740
um yeah we have an eye on a registry for

330
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,500
phb IDs what do you believe it

331
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,540
yeah well it's really interesting

332

um Ayanna was going around checking

333
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,699
whether they had uh active uh uh

334
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,100
designated experts reach registry and

335
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,959
ran across this one yours truly want

336
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,120
Disney experts Brian Carpenter is the

337
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
other we looked at the registry it's

338
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,199
over a decade old it's still empty

339
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,060
that's a real strong suggestion that

340
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,500
whatever it was trying to use the

341
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,320
registry isn't particularly useful

342
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,959
um so the path forward is I'm going to

343
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,060
write a draft that obsoletes the stuff

344
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,500
that uses the registry which is I under

345
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,839
registered uh per hop Behavior dinner I

346
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,699
own a relationship identification codes

347
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,860
for perhap behaviors that aren't

348
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,199
standards track and don't have and

349
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,699
therefore don't have a default

350
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,620
recommended dscp

351
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,060
the only thing we're going to do is

352
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,620
obsolete those things that we never use

353
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,019
because nobody ever registered one

354
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,079
um get uh update our 340 get rid of that

355
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,180
leave the existing format which is

356
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,600
essentially an encapsulated dscp

357
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,720
um and uh close-handed registry so no

358
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,399
effect in use of DSC fees are signaling

359
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,920
no effect on PHP IDs and embedded dscp

360
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
nobody's used this thing we're going to

361
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,740
get rid of it

362
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,480
Martin

363
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,260
um I propose nothing uh the um secret

364
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,480
isg back handle says the zoo lip is back

365
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,180
up so if we can monitor the zulip the

366
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,220
chat is back up so if we could please

367
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,779
monitor the chat Channel thank you

368
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,240
and there will be a phbid registry

369
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,199
internet draft appearing is that right

370
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,699
at some point soon don't hold your

371
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,680
breath because somewhere between the

372
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,860
change in XML format for rfcs my

373
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,779
external based tool chain collapse I'm

374
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,220
not going to have to rebuild and mark

375
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,740
down tool chain that comes first 14 is a

376
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,380
small draft it's a good test case

377
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,720
okay at which point we will look more

378
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,639
closely at that register and decide what

379
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,660
to do yeah

380
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,219
okay and next slide

381
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
welcome Martin

382
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,119
welcome Martin Martin would you like to

383
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,059
say something on behalf of Martin well I

384
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,579
was going to say this is Martin I mean

385
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,900
we said the name Martin several times

386
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,040
he's our new working group chair he's

387
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,240
acclimatizing to being up here in front

388
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,179
of everybody and um it's really good to

389
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,280
have him here thank you

390
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,260
I will be continuing as a working group

391
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,140
chair for the foreseeable future and

392
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,820
David black

393
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,440
I will be stepping down his working

394
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,919
group chair after a uh long uh and uh

395
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
interest interesting experience up here

396
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,640
I'm going to continue to separate drafts

397
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,860
not quite true the exact timing of this

398
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,419
but it will happen some sometime the

399
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,419
next few months Mr Duke sir yeah I would

400
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,100
just take a moment I would like to take

401
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,720
a moment to recognize David

402
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,120
um he has been the tsvw chair since

403
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,520
before I started coming to iitf meetings

404
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,760
I've never known a tsvwg that he was not

405
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,799
sharing and and like obviously being a

406
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,700
very present and active leader of

407
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,360
an expert on just a wide swath of the

408
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,940
kindness oh first of all tscw said you

409
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,740
know a very

410
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,760
robust group with like a wide swath of

411
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,799
technology that it covers and David has

412
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,140
done covered it quite adeptly and been

413
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,440
really an expert on a whole lot of stuff

414
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,660
um and uh I mean hopefully you're not

415
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,360
gonna you're gonna be around

416
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,280
to to continue to um provide your

417
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,020
expertise for the group just maybe from

418
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,280
from the floor where you can you know

419
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,539
take the gloves off which should be

420
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,820
quite entertaining and aside from the

421
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,440
technical you know obviously this is

422
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,200
this group has had um its share of

423
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,919
strife to be quite Frank about it and

424
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,299
um that's always

425
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,080
um

426
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,320
a uh a demanding thing for our chair to

427
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,419
handle and he has been um instrumental

428
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,980
in doing that so thank you for

429
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,179
everything you've done for the transport

430
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,419
area and the ITF and um like I said I

431
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,520
hope we hope to we hope to continue to

432
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,740
see you around

433
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,520
thank you very much

434
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,720
thank you very much I intend to stick

435
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
around perhaps more virtually and

436
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,140
physically but uh I'm not going anytime

437
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,360
soon and as Martin has reminds me

438
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,160
occasionally I still have some drafts

439
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
and responsible for Shepard

440
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
plus when I just volunteered to write

441
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,860
okay

442
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,600
so the next slides will be the

443
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,120
individual documents which are just

444
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,919
brought up here for a heads up this is a

445
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,080
new experiment you get two minutes to

446
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,039
pitch up on your draft if you want to so

447
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,260
come up now if you wish to give it a

448
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,280
talk

449
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,020
um for two minutes on your draft if not

450
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,059
then we will we will introduce it for

451
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,500
you

452
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,280
so who's first Jason Jason

453
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,260
while Jess is coming to the mic I'll

454
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,360
clarify that Wes Eddie will remain a

455
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,020
Shepherd for the l4s Ops work uh wise

456
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,640
has kindly agreed just to continue with

457
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,039
this so very grateful for that right

458
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,880
Albert Jason for his magic two minutes

459
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,080
right no pressure two minutes my

460
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,360
goodness well this one's pretty simple

461
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,100
um so in the process of getting ready

462
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,919
for deployment of all Forest types of

463
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,299
Technologies I've been talking to a

464
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,299
number of folks not just um folks on you

465
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,860
know sort of business positions but

466
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,960
policy makers

467
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
um you know researchers those kind of

468
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,720
folks that really influence the

469
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,240
technical environment in which isps

470
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,400
operate day to day

471
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,039
um and the key questions that they often

472
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,620
ask which this uh draft attempts to

473
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,059
address are what this means in relation

474
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,240
to prioritization sort of Fast Lanes and

475
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,860
slow Lanes in the American Regulatory

476
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,340
parlance and capacity or speed

477
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,960
um because those are very very common

478
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,179
points of confusion and then of course

479
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,039
how does this relate to the concept of

480
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,160
net neutrality and a fair treatment of

481
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
all applications without regard to the

482
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,900
protocol being used or or something

483
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,059
along those lines and so those are the

484
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,039
key two things that it speaks to and

485
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,039
then as a result it suggests sort of

486
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,900
four key things there might be a few

487
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,880
more bits and Bobs in there but

488
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,440
um really suggests this orientation

489
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,080
towards applications marking the traffic

490
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,539
rather than the network and I put that

491
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,100
one in particular because as soon as we

492
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,140
started talking about this we had sort

493
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,059
of DPI style vendors coming out of the

494
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,580
woodwork telling us that because apps

495
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,919
won't be marking anytime soon we should

496
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,380
put this magic you know inspection thing

497
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,059
in the network and it will magically

498
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,520
infer what applications which by the way

499
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,100
are encrypted you know need what type of

500
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,840
um you know queuing and that's a

501
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,760
nightmare and always results in improper

502
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,440
treatment and potentially starvation or

503
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,360
other negative effects and we've done

504
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,679
that before with TCP resets uh oops so

505
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,500
um you know I put that in there

506
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,820
application or Edge providers being able

507
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,080
to use it

508
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,740
um really on a sort of open base us

509
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,120
multiple you know sort of Edge Equipment

510
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,179
types should be supported okay you need

511
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,559
to wrap up quickly

512
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,659
so that's that I'm happy to take any

513
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,640
changes and uh there's a GitHub

514
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,640
repository thank you

515
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,200
Jeff are you doing hpcc

516
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,720
hi everyone so hpcc uh what is it it's I

517
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,820
novel congestion control mechanism

518
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,799
leveraging in bent Telemetry so each

519
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,500
node in the possible population data and

520
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,720
Center based on the data can either

521
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,240
adjust the sending rate or change

522
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,299
entropy why should you care

523
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,860
if you are building

524
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,780
IP address infrastructure for either

525
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,240
storage or machine learning especially

526
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,340
if you combine learning and inference

527
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,539
the same network

528
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,179
you'll figure out Hardware the tcmp

529
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,280
doesn't work due to collisions or you'll

530
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,059
have to keep your network 30 loading

531
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,280
uh you need to build lossless networks

532
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,320
because this is how we do machine

533
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,880
learning in general

534
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
you would need to spend a lot of time

535
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,380
and effort to build Network and

536
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,179
if you try to build it lossless fashion

537
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,700
without better congestion control the

538
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,380
cost just run out of control so

539
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,659
practically what we are doing here

540
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,539
we are gathering all the data as we

541
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,820
travel the network send it back to the

542
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,980
sender sender adjust the rate and allows

543
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,820
you to adjust the rate Within rtt

544
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,559
so if you would deploy something that

545
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,679
today you would probably run gcqcn which

546
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,400
works pretty well for long flows and you

547
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,500
know large environments however as you

548
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,720
try to put it into machine learning

549
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,419
clusters it stops working

550
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,720
uh we spent a year working on different

551
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,080
encodics you know there's a zoo of

552
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,280
indent limiting population unfortunately

553
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,120
in ibpm so we got to support all of this

554
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,640
recordings and metadata most importantly

555
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,400
we got all four

556
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,620
data center silicon vendors to support

557
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,919
it so you see Sisk broadcom melanox

558
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,120
sorry Nvidia and Intel supporting it's

559
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,700
coming in Silicon that's going to be

560
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,679
shipping starting now

561
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,799
so please do read the drafts uh we

562
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,480
expect a lot of people to be interested

563
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,100
in this technology it's much better than

564
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,140
what we have today most importantly

565
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
there are implementations in deployment

566
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,220
Alibaba runs this hpcc yeah

567
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,700
and Alibaba deployed hpcc with TCP just

568
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,480
three months ago so uh there is a larger

569
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,760
deck published and hopefully we'll get

570
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,280
them next ITF to present yeah thank you

571
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,940
John go ahead yeah the the uh the larger

572
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,919
deck is um is in the meeting materials

573
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,659
and we may get to it if we get get to it

574
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,520
if we have coming into session John go

575
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
ahead

576
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,860
so this is a draft that identifies some

577
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,840
media header extensions in terms of

578
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,380
metadata that is uh specific to wireless

579
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,440
networks I think for now uh because the

580
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,720
media I mean the the motivation is that

581
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,580
media applications demand low latency

582
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,760
and high bandwidth and handling this

583
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,580
kind of wireless link capacity variation

584
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,860
along with network utilization and the

585
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,260
demands of media applications is quite

586
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,760
challenging in the wireless networks

587
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,179
along with that we have HTTP 3 or quick

588
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,799
based media that's going to be

589
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,559
encrypting packets so multi-streaming

590
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,700
needs to be considered in 3gpp the xrm

591
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,400
working group has cons I mean sorry

592
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
study has considered some solutions but

593
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,059
we think that the ietf is a good place

594
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,299
to look at these options and avoid I

595
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,480
mean it have a common solution to the

596
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,220
problems that exist for all kinds of

597
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,179
Wireless I mean Wi-Fi and 3gp Networks

598
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,120
and we've identified a minimum set of

599
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,460
things which we think should be secured

600
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,240
and sent only between trusted parties uh

601
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,940
but at this point we're thinking of the

602
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,340
priority or importance of packets for

603
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,799
example an iframe should not even if

604
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,200
it's past a budget it should be sent

605
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,299
because otherwise it causes further

606
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,000
damage a scheduler in the radio network

607
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,299
can get use of packet bursts so that's

608
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,400
going to be a useful amount of

609
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,940
information and then delay budgets and

610
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,039
last the third part is that you know how

611
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,080
do we transport it and there are

612
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,059
multiple options at this point possibly

613
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,340
and each have different trade-offs so

614
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,559
there's media over quick with just HTTP

615
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,520
3

616
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,140
UDP options which is more General but

617
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,140
we've got to consider the API mask and

618
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,659
encapsulation which is more flexible but

619
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:55,679
then we're going to consider the

620
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
overhead and uh so you know that's

621
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,840
that's where we are at this point

622
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,580
um if you would read the draft and give

623
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,440
comments and suggestions that would be

624
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,539
very very nice almost exactly two

625
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,980
minutes well done

626
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,140
yeah for those three drops please look

627
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,480
at them please discuss on the list

628
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,260
um

629
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,299
likely at the next meeting every

630
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,400
question we will ask people to see if

631
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,659
they've read them or what they think of

632
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,100
them

633
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,939
oh it's me

634
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,900
I can actually be me

635
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,980
um

636
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,779
I'm one of the co-authors of the

637
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,340
considerations for assigning a new

638
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,039
recommended dscp this has been through a

639
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
working group last call so I'll try and

640
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,659
be relatively quick on this there were

641
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,559
changes in zero three and zero four

642
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,440
we added various clarifications

643
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,940
um

644
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,700
we had a request to mention 3086 so we

645
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,200
did

646
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,659
um we noted

647
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,520
um more explicitly that there are

648
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,980
different ways in which packets can be

649
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,620
remarked from the original marking that

650
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,840
they were sent with and we just tried to

651
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
highlight that a little bit more clearly

652
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,900
so that um nobody got confused about

653
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,100
implying what it meant to see a remark

654
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,360
packet

655
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,720
we changed the word pathology which

656
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,760
seems to be a relatively common

657
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,620
measurement term but has other

658
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,179
connotations used outside of the

659
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,340
measurement community so we can change

660
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,980
it to Observatory marking behavior and

661
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,500
we made various editorial Updates this

662
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,460
was the version last called

663
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,720
um we had some issues in working group

664
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,460
last call we had a number of different

665
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,860
topics raised and we put those in the

666
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,039
issue trackers the first set here are

667
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,320
all things that we think required better

668
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,600
text it's amazing how many times you can

669
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,120
improve your text we found yet more

670
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,620
places where the text could be better

671
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,960
maybe as other people reviewed this

672
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,940
higher levels I was hoping that it

673
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,440
passes out of this working group we'll

674
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
find yet more

675
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,120
corrections but we think all these are

676
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,159
solved in our editor's copy and we plan

677
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,260
to push this after this meeting as soon

678
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,940
as the meeting closes we'll push the new

679
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,460
version with a also an introduction to

680
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,039
all the behaviors in section 6.

681
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,400
David yes well

682
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,159
um we didn't include one of the requests

683
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,320
made in the working group must call yet

684
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,559
in our editor's version and it was to

685
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,659
discuss an issue

686
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,620
that happens when you have a

687
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,020
remarking behavior that

688
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,440
comes from a TOS precedence bleach

689
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,460
and where basically the first three bits

690
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,200
of the dscp are reset and

691
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,140
rudiger gave us this example as part of

692
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,960
his uh offering on comment and we didn't

693
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,760
include this text but we could still do

694
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,740
it if people think it's really important

695
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,520
it described example a and example B

696
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,740
example B being something that is kind

697
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,779
of like diff surf compliant because it

698
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,419
uses six bits to classify a set of rules

699
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,419
into another set of six bit rules each

700
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,640
individual dscp is remarked to a new

701
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,380
dscp

702
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,899
if you were to use some bleaching

703
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,700
mechanisms you would simply zero some

704
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,799
part of it as in example a

705
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,200
that anyone who knows anything about any

706
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,419
way in which coding happens you'd

707
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,679
realize these actually have the same

708
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,440
result so there are multiple ways to

709
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,260
represent the same thing and this is

710
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,820
part of the whole confusion about what

711
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,100
it means to bleach something I think the

712
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,380
real issue that we were trying to convey

713
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,779
in the draft was the intent behind the

714
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,140
remarking not the remarking itself

715
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,600
so if that confused you you can look at

716
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,419
the slide puzzle on it and password past

717
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:46,980
comments

718
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,200
um if anyone would like to ask a

719
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,940
question about this and feels really

720
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,760
passionate that something should arise

721
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,140
from this

722
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,460
um then please let us know otherwise

723
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,020
we'll go with the text written here

724
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,840
which I think also includes David's

725
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,940
comment on a similar subject

726
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,940
which is a very long explanation to say

727
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,799
um please read the draft and list text

728
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,860
if you care David let's slide number

729
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,179
three was

730
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:13,559
um somebody helpfully asked us about

731
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,500
their owner PHP ID and um

732
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,179
it was going to be a nice slide but

733
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,919
David already stole my thunder and we're

734
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,260
not going to say anything about this

735
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,340
on the last slide

736
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,279
there you go I think we're done anybody

737
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,960
any questions or any other issues that

738
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,760
they'd like to raise

739
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,340
good then I can go and put my mask on

740
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,520
again

741
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,740
Greg operational guidance

742
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,460
all right thank you

743
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,840
um actually before I get into

744
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,120
operational guidance I will say one

745
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,100
thing about the nqb draft since you

746
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,039
mentioned I would talk about it um I

747
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,539
don't have a slot on the agenda for it

748
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,340
so um it isn't working group last call

749
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,980
there already have been a few uh

750
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,299
comments have come in on the mailing

751
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,179
list but please do review the draft uh

752
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,159
and contribute to that discussion I

753
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,100
believe it has two more weeks until

754
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,200
um the work group last call ends so

755
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,600
again please review and provide comments

756
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,179
thank you all right hang on all right

757
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,980
just a minute need to go get your slides

758
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,360
back

759
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,860
um

760
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,580
there we go

761
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,940
all right

762
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,539
um the l4s Ops draft you can go on to

763
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:40,710
the next slide

764
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,679
[Music]

765
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,140
if you've not been aware of this

766
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,720
document before it talks about

767
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,899
deployment of l4s on the internet as it

768
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,960
is today which potentially could include

769
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,820
some RFC 3168 or classic

770
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,880
ecn aqm bottlenecks

771
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,980
and if those do exist on the internet

772
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,919
and classic traffic shares that

773
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,399
bottleneck with l4s traffic

774
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,080
there can be a rate imbalance where l4s

775
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,820
traffic gets more throughput than

776
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,460
classic does anyway the draft talks

777
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,620
about how to manage that situation

778
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,500
guidance for and hosts and network

779
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,620
operators and researchers as the l4s

780
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,940
graphs have gone through the working

781
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,600
class caller now in the editor's queue

782
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,360
we as a working group agreed to keep

783
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,120
this document open as a living document

784
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,720
as the experiments and deployment of l4s

785
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,120
begins to capture any learnings that

786
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,580
that that come along with that initial

787
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,820
deployment so I just posted a new

788
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,519
version of the document today

789
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:54,240
um and uh just to keep it alive and

790
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,940
again if anyone has any contributions

791
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,159
for that document please bring them up

792
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,440
on the mailing list and uh and we'll get

793
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,960
them added so I'm quite sure you and

794
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,460
Jason know each other

795
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,140
yeah

796
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,719
yeah we do

797
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,000
all right another topic I want to

798
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,040
mention which wasn't explicitly on the

799
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,739
agenda but since I'm up here I asked to

800
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,320
mention it a little bit on the next

801
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,760
slide some interoperability events that

802
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,679
have been going on around l4s we had our

803
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,899
first ietf l4s interop at ietf 114 in

804
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,960
Philadelphia I was pretty well attended

805
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,239
and got a lot of work done around

806
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,179
multiple implementations of l4s

807
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,280
congestion control and network

808
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,060
bottlenecks and congestion feedback bugs

809
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,099
were found bugs were fixed different

810
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,399
test cases will run

811
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,399
and uh after Philadelphia cable Labs

812
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,918
hosted another interop event at our

813
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,920
facility near Denver

814
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,619
again nicely attended and uh and and

815
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,320
those include

816
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,080
results from that and then currently

817
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,359
downstairs in the other Tower the main

818
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,579
the building we are running our second

819
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,940
ietf l4s interop

820
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,460
the link on the slide there is the

821
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,440
presentation that we did at the

822
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,940
conclusion of hackathon yesterday

823
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,940
afternoon but the testing still

824
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,040
continues some of it will will run

825
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,119
probably all week we've got two 5G

826
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,800
networks that are implementing l4s as

827
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,619
well as Wi-Fi gear and a fixed Network

828
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,560
emulator and then a number of different

829
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,780
endpoint implementations congestion

830
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,520
control implementations that are running

831
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,940
across those networks so

832
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,460
that's going on currently and after this

833
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,060
meeting down in the the room where the

834
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,720
hackathon was taking place there is a

835
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,599
happy hour please stop by you can see

836
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,660
the demos of the

837
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,400
real-time streaming media applications

838
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,119
that are running over l4s bottlenecks

839
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,640
some nice uh nice graphical demos for

840
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,220
that so please stop by with that and

841
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,300
then upcoming opportunity communities

842
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,460
cable apps is planning on hosting

843
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,040
another interop at our facility in

844
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,700
January end of January

845
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,400
the next ITF in Yokohama is a

846
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,940
possibility to host a third ietf interop

847
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,440
for l4s that will depend on interest and

848
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,359
availability and so if you're interested

849
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,520
in participating in that please let me

850
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,240
know

851
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,079
and I think that's it so our our

852
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,560
milestone for this is completion in July

853
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,780
2023 does that sound reasonable still

854
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,640
I

855
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,160
I wouldn't change it today

856
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,020
um but as we get closer to that date

857
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,579
that might be a good question to ask

858
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,680
whether we're far enough along in the

859
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,140
deployment to have further guidance to

860
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,240
add but we can always revise if it's

861
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,400
better Bob

862
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,680
are you I just wanted to

863
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,560
um clarify when Greg said it's in where

864
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,420
the hackathon was

865
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,720
um it's Admiral sweet which is the low

866
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,820
gram third floor right at the bottom of

867
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,380
the East Tower

868
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,500
yeah thank you and Bob will forgive you

869
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,000
if you're not joining my queue this time

870
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,599
[Laughter]

871
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,339
any other questions or comments

872
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:34,940
thank you for your talk

873
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,420
next topic will be the working Group

874
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,480
Transport drafts with MP dccp okay

875
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,300
um

876
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,300
no sorry yes please go ahead

877
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,700
oh I am majoring and I'm from xiaomi

878
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,700
located in Beijing here is our brief

879
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,460
introduction of the mptccp

880
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,839
interoperability test SBT

881
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:09,619
next

882
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,099
uh here is what we did we have ported

883
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:18,359
the mptcp to Android 13 based on Android

884
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:23,339
T version phones with 5.10 Kona world

885
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:28,940
right running and we verified the

886
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,079
policy and the interoperability of mptcp

887
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,640
OC Land one environment

888
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,480
here here is what we have done uh we

889
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,520
read the specification reported the

890
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,180
mptcp internal module and also the udccp

891
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,720
commanders and also we sold many

892
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,280
problems and finally we approved

893
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,920
performed as a high Prof interability

894
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,240
test next

895
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,960
uh before the test we made some

896
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,599
Gravitation

897
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,079
we actually follow the reference

898
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,960
implementation and we prepared

899
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,520
uh one mobile phone with dual WLAN

900
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,619
capability and we modify the kernel

901
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,400
with 5.101 version

902
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,980
and

903
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:42,200
thanks to dtz provided the server side

904
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,839
implementation why is there for virtual

905
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,119
machine and another is

906
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,780
one remote server located in Germany

907
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,220
uh

908
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,280
then we set up the

909
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,700
layer and the one test environment

910
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,700
of all the IQ addresses are listed here

911
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,240
uh especially especially for the one

912
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,500
environment we you we are using the

913
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,660
udccp header convention application

914
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,079
to to avoid the problems with middle

915
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,619
boxes between

916
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:34,140
uh China and Germany internet transfer

917
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,760
or the next one

918
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,460
uh

919
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,119
here are the functions

920
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:52,079
verified in the uh in our inability test

921
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,579
uh

922
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:56,760
we configure the

923
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,200
all necessary options

924
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,040
uh first one we we import the mptcp

925
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,579
capability capability on every physical

926
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:12,660
interfaces and also we enable the

927
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,240
transfer options we also configure the

928
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,680
routine rules and we set the translation

929
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,320
port

930
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,220
finally we

931
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,020
we perform the right test

932
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,760
the right side is the functions here

933
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,900
and the next page

934
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,579
uh

935
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,500
in the first step we verified the first

936
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,280
subflow handshake process and along with

937
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,780
the MP capable and the MP key functions

938
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,560
uh you can see from the

939
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,480
TCP dump and the Y shark uh

940
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,839
files here the next one

941
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,020
the next one is the second subflow

942
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,280
handshake and also the MP joint and MPH

943
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,220
Mac capabilities here

944
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,080
the next

945
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,280
[Music]

946
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,260
uh

947
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,200
the next day this is a

948
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,140
this is for the sequence and the rtt

949
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,300
measurement

950
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,020
the next

951
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,740
uh this is for the MP close function

952
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,459
verified

953
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,820
the next one please

954
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,540
uh this is for the priority the address

955
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,859
add function and also the confirm

956
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,599
function

957
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,560
the next one

958
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,220
this is a uh address remove remove

959
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,040
function and the fallback machine

960
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,240
uh functions

961
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,800
so next one

962
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,300
here I will plan to push the mptcp

963
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,280
further

964
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,359
uh right now we have test the basic

965
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:28,160
function and the next step we will

966
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,180
put the tomb prox

967
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,460
to Android kernel under deploy the

968
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,560
encapsulation framework to allow the

969
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,640
multi-pass transfer transport of any IP

970
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,540
traffic

971
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,060
uh

972
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,480
finally we will test the real-time

973
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,760
service

974
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,400
such as Skype uip sources

975
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,680
so the next one

976
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,280
uh here I will conclusion for the mptcp

977
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,660
interoperability test

978
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,339
uh the functions of mpdcp works well

979
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,940
from our opinion and

980
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,780
we actually

981
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:28,319
use different combinations of mptcp in

982
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:33,720
4.14 and 5 on 10 Linux reference

983
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,660
in meditation and

984
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,359
the reporting on the Android searching

985
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,000
also we

986
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,940
we run the test in both slide and one

987
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,619
environment

988
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,319
which proves the complaintenance and

989
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,980
maturity of anti-dccp draft 206

990
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,960
and

991
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,020
uh

992
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,960
its usage and the function operations

993
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,380
are very similar to the mptcp protocol

994
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,660
okay that's all

995
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
any questions

996
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,119
foreign

997
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:28,740
code is always very very good to see for

998
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,420
a new protocol so thank you very much

999
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,560
look looks like a solid piece of work

1000
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,099
okay thank you

1001
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,359
so on to Marcus I think

1002
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,500
there we go

1003
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,740
hi everyone Marcus from Dr Telecom

1004
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,420
giving some overview on the multiples

1005
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,640
dccp progress next slide please

1006
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,800
yeah starting with the draft maturity

1007
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,700
State how we as authors see it so it's

1008
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,880
all already outlined in Philadelphia the

1009
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,460
freeze feature state birds version four

1010
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,160
so no further updates from our site

1011
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,040
we're added to the draft and we mainly

1012
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,880
focused on getting external reviewers to

1013
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,180
providing us feedback that accumulated

1014
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,260
in

1015
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,560
the current version 6 of the draft I

1016
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,119
will get more into detail on the next

1017
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,940
slide remaining minor work we see at the

1018
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,760
moment so there's

1019
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,940
some feedback from uh see monophel in

1020
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,300
writer

1021
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,760
um and also some Ayana review

1022
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,859
um here we still have to dig into and to

1023
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:48,540
close all the existing issues in our

1024
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,260
GitHub repository next slide please

1025
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,960
yeah you see a number of changes since

1026
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,260
last iitf uh where we presented version

1027
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,560
five now we are at six as I outlined I

1028
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,980
will not go in in all the details here

1029
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,920
but just to give you a brief overview on

1030
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,900
the on the number of issues we solved

1031
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,119
together with the reviewers have in mind

1032
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,520
all the issues we solved when accordance

1033
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,740
with the with reviewers so they gave out

1034
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,000
the okay

1035
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,240
uh that we solved the issue in the draft

1036
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,420
we had some editorial

1037
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,579
issues we solved and all the other

1038
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:30,060
things I really helped to

1039
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,140
um

1040
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,020
yeah all the other issues are mentioned

1041
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,800
here

1042
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,440
helps to give some clarity to the whole

1043
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,359
to the whole draft and make it better

1044
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,579
readable to externals not just to the

1045
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:42,480
authors

1046
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,520
a full change log is available did you

1047
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,380
see it on the bottom right

1048
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,720
so we maintained this with GitHub which

1049
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,880
gives you a nice overview

1050
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,920
yeah oh that doesn't look complete this

1051
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,220
light some check marks are missing but

1052
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,760
maybe I can outline it without having

1053
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,140
all the symbols presented here

1054
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,240
um so last time in Philadelphia

1055
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,859
we mentioned that all the

1056
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,380
functionalities and multipass options we

1057
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,000
Define in the draft

1058
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,119
in the in the left table were completed

1059
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,420
and this time we focused on completing

1060
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,140
all the things in the right table so we

1061
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,940
can State implementation is completed

1062
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,640
now we fixed the last things and

1063
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,920
improved them mainly about multi-pass

1064
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,859
confirm functionality which gives a

1065
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:41,700
reliability to some of the multi-pass

1066
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,800
options like the editors remove address

1067
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,579
and the prior

1068
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,700
we verify the fallback mechanisms also

1069
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,040
together with xiaomi as you have seen in

1070
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,119
the previous

1071
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,380
a presentation and we implemented the

1072
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,800
two different closing procedures based

1073
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,200
on multi-path close and multi-pass Fast

1074
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,500
close you also find here

1075
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,900
um right to the table uh the pull

1076
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,099
requests

1077
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,500
in which we added those functionalities

1078
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,960
to the public GitHub repository of our

1079
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,260
Linux reference implementation

1080
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,480
um yeah and with that we started the

1081
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,700
interoperability test as Tommy has

1082
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,740
outlined next slide please

1083
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,420
Okay so

1084
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,359
ending with a summary here

1085
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,740
um yeah

1086
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,859
we did together with some me some or not

1087
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,900
some we did the interoperability test

1088
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,319
which confirmed that multi-pass dccp as

1089
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:04,980
it is specified so far works and

1090
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,040
um all the different functionalities we

1091
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,079
have specified

1092
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,180
um worked with between two different

1093
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,780
entities uh a server hosted by Deutsche

1094
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,560
Telecom in in Germany and the UE a

1095
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,720
smartphone implementation running in

1096
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,119
China

1097
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,980
they ported the multi-pass dccp to

1098
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,500
Android 13.

1099
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,680
um based on a 5.10 kernel

1100
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,680
and they solved multiple issues compared

1101
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,380
to the Linux reference implementation

1102
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,680
they verified that the code matched the

1103
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,440
mpdccp specification

1104
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,900
and yeah last but not least as I already

1105
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,079
said so we run the successful successful

1106
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,220
interoperability test

1107
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,619
um there's also or what supported us in

1108
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,619
that was also a new Wireshark detector

1109
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,079
um thanks to a PhD student from City

1110
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,760
University London

1111
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,359
who made this public available

1112
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:09,000
and we improved this dissector also

1113
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,359
during the hackathon on Saturday

1114
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:15,059
so saying here the wire Factory sector

1115
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:18,660
is available which is in line with the

1116
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,780
mpdcp trust version 6.

1117
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,940
yeah now coming to the interesting

1118
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,640
questions or discussions probably

1119
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,380
um you have maybe have also already seen

1120
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,200
on the mailing list also thanks to Gary

1121
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,780
um that we approach to

1122
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,180
working group last call and there's also

1123
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,920
a discussion to move

1124
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,980
um the mpdczp draft from experimental

1125
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,980
track to proposed standard so I'm

1126
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,660
supported that let me go try to show the

1127
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,579
slide Mark is meant to show I'm gonna

1128
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,559
require a little bit of uh Meade Echo

1129
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,740
magic okay

1130
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,400
um

1131
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,099
so there there are no further

1132
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,440
remarks from my side um I think it would

1133
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,420
be no good to get some some feedback on

1134
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,040
this working group last call and propose

1135
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,140
standard track question okay hang on a

1136
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,578
minute okay right

1137
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,680
yeah probably maybe

1138
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,760
also there I just cannot get that slide

1139
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,579
up on the screen sorry so I think the

1140
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,680
first question I've got to the group is

1141
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,839
not this question but first of all uh

1142
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:27,359
could I have a show of hands for people

1143
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,059
who have read

1144
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:32,160
this or a

1145
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,140
maybe the previous version so I want to

1146
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,400
know how many people have been reading

1147
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,520
this work as it's been developed and are

1148
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,920
we going to use a tool to do this David

1149
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,260
oh yeah you're showing the ticks okay

1150
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,000
there's there's a few ticks here

1151
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,960
um that's what you wanted to show isn't

1152
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,359
it right okay uh I'm going I'm going to

1153
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,839
try using the tool and then maybe as a

1154
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,220
calibration device I'm going to try

1155
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,079
using the room and people's real hands

1156
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,940
and see if they cut if the results

1157
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,619
calibrate

1158
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:07,220
so can I use this tool here we go

1159
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,400
and of course the next question will be

1160
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:35,940
um

1161
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,000
do you have input to help us work with

1162
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,140
our ad to decide upon the appropriate um

1163
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,540
position in the RFC series to publish

1164
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,700
this so I'm going to ask people to come

1165
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,500
to the mic to comment on that we've seen

1166
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,180
some comments on the list

1167
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,899
and

1168
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,280
I will be the next question

1169
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,839
do you want to try the test in the real

1170
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,280
room or does that is that a sufficient

1171
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,140
test David

1172
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,140
we have 13 people who've read this I

1173
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,640
think 13 I think over address people

1174
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,559
who've read this read this is excellent

1175
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,760
so uh

1176
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,920
let's go ahead to the next one

1177
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,780
okay so the next question is does

1178
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,420
anybody want to provide any additional

1179
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,040
comments on whether they think this

1180
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,440
document should progress

1181
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,099
to a working group last call as PS

1182
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,260
rather than the current status which is

1183
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,680
experimental so does anybody have any

1184
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,720
comments that might help us make this

1185
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,839
judgment for instance why wouldn't it be

1186
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,059
a PS

1187
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:42,260
PS here means standards track

1188
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,140
does anyone think it should be EXP

1189
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,660
okay um this is actually not the working

1190
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,819
group's call but it's the ad working

1191
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:59,160
with the chairs to decide but we need

1192
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,200
input and Martin's the man who's going

1193
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,300
to have to yeah ask questions I

1194
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,579
definitely would like to add the input

1195
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:07,740
um or rather have some input and I

1196
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,780
wanted to wait for somebody but nobody

1197
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,059
stood up so I'll talk some more

1198
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,240
um uh

1199
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,500
so I think Marcus was okay so number one

1200
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,880
um

1201
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,440
I'm always concerned about real world

1202
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,059
deployment for this Beyond like proofs

1203
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:27,119
of concept and so on uh I think there's

1204
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,500
an excellent point that we also have an

1205
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,300
MP quick thing going on and it makes

1206
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,040
sense for that to align and I don't

1207
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,380
think my co-ad oh my co-80 is here I

1208
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,059
couldn't see him a second ago he and I

1209
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,800
need to get together on this

1210
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,780
um my original thinking when we started

1211
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,460
all this multi-path work

1212
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,099
was that a lot of the scheduling

1213
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:46,200
problems were very researchy problems

1214
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,599
and that what we were doing here was

1215
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,579
creating lots of platforms for the

1216
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,200
research community

1217
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,540
to be able to run those experiments in a

1218
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,520
way they can't necessarily do with mptcp

1219
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,140
very well

1220
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,800
um

1221
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,480
I don't know that if in your particular

1222
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,099
use case Marcus you think you have the

1223
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,500
the scheduling problem solved

1224
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,180
or

1225
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,420
not but so you talk about multiple

1226
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,859
scheduling

1227
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:13,020
um yeah right yeah okay so

1228
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,160
um

1229
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,319
multiple scheduling I think it's it's

1230
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,819
for all of the protocols which are

1231
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:21,300
currently discussed in IDF mptcp MPD CCP

1232
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,619
and multi-pass quick that is very

1233
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:24,960
implementation specific and uh we just

1234
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,480
provide the protocol with that from our

1235
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,180
experience we more or less adopted the

1236
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,559
scheduler already existing for the

1237
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,960
multicast TCP implementation that was

1238
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,540
quite simple because the multiple dccp

1239
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,640
protocol as such provide the same

1240
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,559
information to the schedulers at the

1241
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,020
multi-pass TCP does and I assume uh that

1242
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,920
it's also similar to multipass quick so

1243
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,900
um yeah

1244
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,359
at the end we had not to solve something

1245
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:56,760
so we just adopted what what is what

1246
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,020
already exists

1247
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,400
yeah I think that's a reasonable

1248
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,920
approach and and like I I do think this

1249
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,559
work is certainly ready to progress as a

1250
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,420
document um or certainly go to working

1251
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,920
with last call it seems like we have

1252
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,780
solid implementations and whatnot so

1253
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,059
like I don't want to cast any shade on

1254
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,420
that at all but I am I think when we put

1255
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,480
out a document as proposed standard

1256
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,800
that uh it kind of communicates to

1257
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,240
non-experts that this is kind of

1258
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,700
safe to use

1259
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,280
um in a way that I don't know that the

1260
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,040
multi-path community is I think there

1261
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,059
are a lot of people who unfortunately

1262
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:34,260
are not in this room to speak for

1263
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,599
themselves in in the kind of the

1264
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,099
research Community say this is the own

1265
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:39,780
research problem like multi-pass stuff

1266
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,280
in general

1267
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,240
um

1268
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,980
oh good there are lots of people now so

1269
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,000
I'll sit down and be quiet

1270
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,020
hang on a minute

1271
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,819
you're not an accused you don't exist

1272
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:52,440
Lars you're next

1273
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,200
foreign

1274
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,839
that was very harsh he does exist so

1275
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,540
I've seen him standing in front of me

1276
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,880
um large accurate so I haven't followed

1277
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,680
the multi-path research space a while

1278
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,420
ago so I might not be up to date on this

1279
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,220
and then somebody please correct me so I

1280
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,079
think the the scheduling problem is

1281
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,059
still sort of hard

1282
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,099
um and I don't have I haven't seen

1283
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:15,599
any claims that somebody has a general

1284
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:16,980
solution I know we have solutions that

1285
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,960
work for certain kinds of path

1286
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,540
combinations like you know Wi-Fi and

1287
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,640
through G and so on

1288
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,020
um but it's

1289
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,260
you know it's an it's an efficiency

1290
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,599
problem in the sense that if you have a

1291
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:32,400
scheduler that isn't working very well

1292
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,559
you don't get the throughput or the

1293
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,540
latency you you might get with a better

1294
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:40,619
one but it's not a safety concern

1295
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,720
it it might generate a bit more traffic

1296
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,680
because there might be some

1297
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,059
retransmissions happening while the

1298
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,460
scheduler is doing like stupid stuff

1299
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,500
but it's not like driving us to

1300
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,780
congestion collapse right so

1301
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,359
from a safety perspective I think uh

1302
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:58,020
this should be fine to go as proposed

1303
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,940
but we still actually do need some

1304
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,640
scheduler for more General multi-pass

1305
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,119
scenarios which is the research question

1306
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,339
thanks Lars I think we would have

1307
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:10,680
serious concerns if the group said that

1308
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,160
there were congestion control issues or

1309
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,980
stability issues with this

1310
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,780
um but that was a really useful input

1311
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,480
would you like to come to the mic um

1312
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,700
sorry sorry to make an advantage sorry

1313
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,419
to make the examples

1314
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,440
yeah I just saw a general question I

1315
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,319
have not read this draft honestly but I

1316
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,299
in now if you remember the mobile IP

1317
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:35,040
work we did quite a bit of work on

1318
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,140
multiple care of addresses multiple

1319
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,240
tunnels and all of that there the

1320
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,579
underlying tunnel is a GRE tunnel which

1321
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,819
can GRS or IP but gr is now extended

1322
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:47,040
over gr UDP so the question is two

1323
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,079
questions I think what are the key

1324
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,640
technical differences is that in the

1325
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,160
scheduling the way we use both the links

1326
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,900
that's question number one question

1327
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,480
number two as you know in Mobile AP we

1328
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,220
failed you know I think you know 3gb

1329
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,960
system we had references but we didn't

1330
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,599
have any deployments right overall we

1331
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,980
spend a lot of time if you look at the

1332
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,299
mobile AP community

1333
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:09,240
but we didn't find any traction so

1334
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,880
what's the where is it heading how do

1335
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,920
you see who is going to deploy this I

1336
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,660
think the previous reviewer commenter

1337
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,640
had the same question are the same

1338
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,839
comment

1339
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:21,420
so the the acoustic is quite bad here so

1340
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,280
I'm not sure if I've really got here two

1341
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,460
two questions but maybe I try to

1342
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,780
rephrase it though the first question

1343
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,000
was about how the encapsulation works

1344
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,059
yeah I think I'm trying to compare it

1345
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:39,480
with the mobile AP system where

1346
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,240
where we support multipath

1347
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,119
essentially you know you can a mobile

1348
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,819
node can establish

1349
01:00:47,819 --> 01:00:50,280
two tunnels from two different access

1350
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,960
Technologies

1351
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,200
right now I have the option to do flow

1352
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,000
level distribution or a packet level

1353
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,760
distribution so

1354
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,500
I hope I get your question right but

1355
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,059
first of all it's required that

1356
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,460
multiplies dccp is implemented in both

1357
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,020
endpoints

1358
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:11,220
and then the exit and then we take the

1359
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:14,400
multiple axis which are available to to

1360
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,880
run the multiples dctp protocol across

1361
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,799
it

1362
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:23,040
um the relevance of a mobile system or

1363
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,660
5G system I don't understand to be

1364
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,980
honest

1365
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,020
okay so you may want to look at some of

1366
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,819
the work that happened in the mobile AP

1367
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,200
working groups

1368
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,020
Mobility yeah

1369
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:34,859
um

1370
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,559
so we think with the multipass gcp we

1371
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:40,200
support the mobility aspect

1372
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,940
so we don't see any issue with that but

1373
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,799
we don't follow this

1374
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,420
okay maybe I'll take it off let's take

1375
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,020
it off yeah because

1376
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,240
so I just wanted to respond to Lars but

1377
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,500
I was sure to get in the queue

1378
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,200
um so I I I I do feel pretty comfortable

1379
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,280
this is not going to lead to the

1380
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,900
collapse of the internet

1381
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,059
um under any circumstances but we also

1382
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:04,859
don't have a standards track approach to

1383
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:06,540
multi-path congestion control to address

1384
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,000
shared bottlenecks and the like so I do

1385
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,700
have some concerns about fairness issues

1386
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,440
um which should not necessarily block

1387
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,180
everything but um there's that and then

1388
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,299
people will generally adopt this to

1389
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:22,920
improve their performance because I

1390
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,380
think intuitively it makes sense

1391
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,240
uh you know multiple house will improve

1392
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,880
performance and if the if like the fine

1393
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,200
print is that if you really don't know

1394
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,760
what you're doing

1395
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,260
um with the scheduling like you may not

1396
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,940
get better performance or get much worse

1397
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,099
performance that strikes abusing may be

1398
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,140
not something to stamp with proposed

1399
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,640
state and it applies to all multipasses

1400
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,700
not a specific critique of mpdccp

1401
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,000
um uh like maybe that's not something to

1402
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,980
stand put standards track at this point

1403
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,260
like use with care use the feeling if

1404
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:52,920
you know what you're doing if you're

1405
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,420
networking professional that's to me

1406
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,819
that's experimental RSC but I mean you

1407
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,980
obviously know a lot about RC states too

1408
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,140
so like I'm we can talk about this and

1409
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,980
we're going to talk offline tonight

1410
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,799
anyway so we can go but I just wanted to

1411
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,920
respond for the good of the uh community

1412
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,260
yeah that's actually a good point right

1413
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,819
so so because we actually did never

1414
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:14,099
publish a couple of congestion control

1415
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:17,220
so so this is the old original

1416
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,200
um you know um what's the guy's name

1417
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,859
from Cambridge

1418
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,420
now Frank Kelly did the math and and

1419
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,520
custom and Mark Hamley did the

1420
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,020
implementation right which is sort of

1421
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,640
this the couple contesting control stuff

1422
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,099
that came with part of the original

1423
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:35,220
Damon right sorry costing him later

1424
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,240
um

1425
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,160
the couple connection control has sort

1426
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,380
of this property that is probably uh

1427
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,180
safe in the sense that you don't inject

1428
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,740
more traffic into the network than a

1429
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,599
single flow would and that might be

1430
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,760
actually something that we could pick up

1431
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,400
um as a baseline congestion controller

1432
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,799
because it's mathematically proven that

1433
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,680
it's you know pretty good and then you

1434
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,540
could normatively depend on it and if

1435
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,559
people wanted to do different things

1436
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,480
then they could but

1437
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,819
yeah good point right um we would have a

1438
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:04,559
before standard

1439
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,280
um without a congestion controller which

1440
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,680
we can recommend which feels sort of

1441
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,720
dissatisfying so I don't want to derail

1442
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,040
the discussion but I think it's sort of

1443
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,619
we should probably figure out

1444
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,260
if this is if we feel comfortable doing

1445
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,059
that

1446
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:22,440
um

1447
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,940
what are you using for congestion

1448
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,400
control at the moment the story what are

1449
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,020
you using for congestion control at the

1450
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:28,920
moment

1451
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,760
um we use a PBR implementation

1452
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,040
are you coupling the bbrs or are they

1453
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,260
independent okay so you are injecting

1454
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,960
two or multiple but but we see no issues

1455
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,900
with adopting the uh couple congestion

1456
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,339
code control which was specified for

1457
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:46,680
multiple TCP for example so that this

1458
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,119
could happen

1459
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,859
right so that would be sort of I think

1460
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:51,119
the way but that was was that

1461
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,799
experimental informational I can't

1462
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,420
remember it was not standards track

1463
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,700
and you know what you do in your

1464
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,440
implementation is obviously separate

1465
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,900
from what you would recommend in a

1466
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,940
specification

1467
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,420
um and if we could point to the coupled

1468
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,400
in the specification that would be

1469
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,440
a solution at least we have a remark in

1470
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,359
our draft that we mentioned that couple

1471
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,160
combustion control is available and and

1472
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,619
can be used but my question is do we

1473
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:22,260
really need the work to adopt to our

1474
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,619
prototype coupled congestion control or

1475
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:27,299
can we take the evidence from the

1476
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:29,940
multi-pass TCP that it works so for your

1477
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,740
code right we're not standardizing the

1478
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,599
code we're standardizing works exactly

1479
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,299
and so the words would need to explain

1480
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:39,000
how you do it

1481
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,760
because you know otherwise everybody

1482
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,140
needs to figure this out by themselves

1483
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,339
and that sort of also ends with

1484
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,058
dissatisfying

1485
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,500
do you have words about bbr at the

1486
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,180
moment in the document or

1487
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,400
I struggle now a little bit because I

1488
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,200
know that there are rfcs for for the

1489
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,480
couple congression control for Lira at

1490
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,799
least I think

1491
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,619
um and that we mentioned in the in our

1492
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:04,760
craft that this can be used

1493
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:07,740
but do you say how to use it anyway

1494
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,299
maybe we're going too deep at nearest

1495
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,799
and yeah so

1496
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,299
um

1497
01:06:12,299 --> 01:06:14,099
yes so thank you for this I mean I think

1498
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,480
this is what we can investigate offline

1499
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,400
I just want to bring the big issues out

1500
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,920
um and and ask for Community you know

1501
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,540
reaction to them if I'm completely crazy

1502
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,359
about these concerns thanks yeah this is

1503
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,220
this discussion is really helpful Meera

1504
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,260
is still in line if you wish to say

1505
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,900
something and I think the coupled

1506
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,579
congestion control for multi-path

1507
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:38,880
transports was published as exp in 6356.

1508
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,000
right and it's basically just um

1509
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,559
explaining how to cut the congestion

1510
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,839
control without kind of like you could

1511
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,220
apply different congestion controls to

1512
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,960
it and I think it only applies Reno but

1513
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,339
anyway

1514
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,599
um that's not what my comment was

1515
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:57,660
um I'm I'm usually like we have the

1516
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,039
discussion very often that the transport

1517
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,480
area has been very conservative about

1518
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,640
going for experimental force and like

1519
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,500
I'm actually been arguing many times

1520
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,480
that we should more often go for

1521
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,799
proposed standard but I'm actually a

1522
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:09,539
little bit uneasy about this one because

1523
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:12,000
it's a quite big change like multi

1524
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,640
multi-pass TCP was experimental at the

1525
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,140
beginning as well and then we got a lot

1526
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,839
of implementation experience and the one

1527
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,339
advantage we have here is that you can

1528
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:22,440
actually borrow from that experience and

1529
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,880
you've taken over many mechanisms

1530
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,000
directly from multipass um TCP but you

1531
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,980
still had to add a lot of extra stuff to

1532
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,319
dccp anything about protection

1533
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,420
reordering and so on so there's there's

1534
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,420
a lot of stuff that I think is is an

1535
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,099
addition so this is for me not a small

1536
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:39,000
change

1537
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,539
and so for such a change I would like I

1538
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:43,680
would like to have like a slightly

1539
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,359
higher barrier and it's great that you

1540
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,920
now have like a second implementation

1541
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,200
there but porting a Linux implementation

1542
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,940
to Android is kind of I'm not sure if

1543
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,619
that actually comes as an independent

1544
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:54,839
implementation like I would I would be

1545
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,520
much happier if somebody would actually

1546
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,500
from the draft

1547
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,079
not from your code but from the draft be

1548
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:02,339
able to produce an independent

1549
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:05,039
implementation for example

1550
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,280
okay the last point I understood uh yeah

1551
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,859
I'll clarify that last Point mirror is

1552
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:12,660
actually a requirement for progression

1553
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,400
on the standards track rather than to

1554
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,339
propose standard but it's a way of

1555
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:20,100
judging maturity for sure and I think

1556
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,679
what we're asking here is what's the

1557
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:27,120
maturity of this spec are the risks

1558
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,738
um if you want to think wider are the

1559
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:32,279
same risks in mptcp are the same risks

1560
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,120
in mp quick please talk to either the

1561
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,520
chairs or the ad but please do it

1562
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,339
quickly rapidly because we will have to

1563
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:43,679
make some sort of determination

1564
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,479
and I don't think we can say more at

1565
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,100
this time and we won't we won't make a

1566
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,738
decision until we're ready however we

1567
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:51,420
can ask about working group last call

1568
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,899
and I'd just like to ask how many people

1569
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:56,640
in the room would be happy to review

1570
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,219
this document if it were submitted to a

1571
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,140
working group last call

1572
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:01,859
um

1573
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:04,140
maybe I could try the tool again if you

1574
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,279
like there you go

1575
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,779
would you be happy to review the next

1576
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:12,060
version and say no if you don't think

1577
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,460
this is anywhere near ready or say yes

1578
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,319
if you'd be happy to review it and then

1579
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,880
you can just make your own comments

1580
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:29,580
well we we see people if you're review

1581
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,859
offering to review we saw 14 people say

1582
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:33,420
they'd read this or a recent version

1583
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,219
we've heard some discussion at the mic

1584
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:37,259
you already have a lot of feedback we

1585
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:38,580
can't give you the answers to your

1586
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,679
question but we'll work on them with our

1587
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,660
ad and then provide feedback to the list

1588
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,839
thank you very much Marcus thank you

1589
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,380
foreign

1590
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,040
CTP

1591
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,199
we're currently running roughly two

1592
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,420
agenda times so we're good we're going

1593
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,580
to talk about sctp

1594
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:16,440
oh you've got the analysis yeah yep so

1595
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,040
this is about some recent issues or

1596
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,179
opportunities found in sdp root

1597
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:25,980
recently is a joint work with minus

1598
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,159
vestalon and Claudio perfori

1599
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:31,080
um we're not talking about history I

1600
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,000
will not talk about to solve the

1601
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,179
problems that would be in other

1602
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:36,920
presentations

1603
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,780
so the security requirement requirement

1604
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,260
properties for security protocols or

1605
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,659
systems have increased incredibly since

1606
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:49,800
sadp what was was written for the use

1607
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,940
and for the use cases there uh modern

1608
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,980
systems typically require strong

1609
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,340
confidentiality strong Integrity strong

1610
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,580
replay protection and high availability

1611
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,620
at least these are the things that 5G

1612
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,980
require for the the use cases it has for

1613
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:12,480
dtls over satp and with strong it was

1614
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,000
meant that it should be computationally

1615
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,679
infeasible as hard as breaking is

1616
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:21,840
data here refers to has to do with

1617
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,780
external user messages not internal

1618
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,320
things like scdp chunks availability is

1619
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,659
a bit harder to Define but given an

1620
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:34,260
attacker should not be I mean easy than

1621
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,659
expected to affect the availability like

1622
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,239
Center a single packet and tearing down

1623
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:42,600
their Association Next slide

1624
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,620
uh so these are the issues we have found

1625
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:50,820
uh as satp would use this um the keys

1626
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,300
are not directional you can

1627
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:57,420
reflect uh authenticated chunks for

1628
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,260
example data sets

1629
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:04,380
and to do this and you need to be in on

1630
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,560
path attacker with read capabilities you

1631
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,280
don't need to have right capabilities

1632
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:14,520
for the reflected chunks to be accepted

1633
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,340
you need to match t7 stream identifier

1634
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,560
and stream sequence number stream

1635
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,880
identifier is probably quite easy

1636
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,040
if you have very large messages in the

1637
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,380
worst case then the stream sequence

1638
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,840
number wouldn't change at all and the

1639
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,560
thing you need to what match is TSM so

1640
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,580
after 0 to 2 to the power of 31 chunks

1641
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,900
average total power of 30 in the worst

1642
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,179
case it's trivial to do this

1643
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:46,820
um

1644
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,500
and what's happened is that you might

1645
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,300
reflect the whole message you might

1646
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,239
reflect part of the message corrupt the

1647
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,640
use message or it might be some error

1648
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,679
leading to a termination of the

1649
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,659
association

1650
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:04,500
uh uh next

1651
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:09,500
uh then as the replay protection

1652
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:13,440
duplication relies on TSN and TSN is

1653
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,000
only has 2 to the power of 32 values uh

1654
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,820
when this wraps of the if you have a

1655
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,340
very long Association then you can do

1656
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:26,280
replay of data what you have to match is

1657
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,940
the same as in the reflection attack

1658
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,280
still worst use case is worst case is

1659
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,620
that you have very large messages then

1660
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,780
they only then you just have to wait and

1661
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,800
it's trivial of the two to 32 messages

1662
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,560
uh this is very similar to the other the

1663
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,620
reflection is a little bit easier to do

1664
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,280
uh than the replay the break slightly

1665
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,520
different properties

1666
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,480
um next

1667
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,000
slide uh three more issues should three

1668
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,020
is a very theoretical issue as as and

1669
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,600
all of these are analysis of the

1670
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,460
specifications not any implementation

1671
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,980
this is a theoretical issue the

1672
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,320
specification allows you to use the same

1673
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,260
key with different algorithms and this

1674
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,500
is typically should not not or must not

1675
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,960
in modern RBC but I don't see any

1676
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,360
practical problems with the current

1677
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,500
algorithms uh number four is reflection

1678
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,960
but of authenticated control chunks

1679
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,320
instead of data

1680
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,179
and this is easier because you don't

1681
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:40,140
have to match a TSM uh for example the

1682
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,620
error message can be trivially reflected

1683
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:46,679
back to the sender

1684
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:49,460
if you reflect the sac control chunk

1685
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,500
this might or would or might lead to

1686
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,980
packet loss missing data any consistent

1687
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,840
State probably tearing down the

1688
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,600
association at some point and then

1689
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,360
heartbeat act might also be an attack

1690
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,920
availability if you reflect that uh so

1691
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,960
these four is different and another this

1692
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,980
is an attack on availability only not on

1693
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,280
integrity and so on uh and five is that

1694
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,640
you can do replay of control chunks

1695
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,640
um very similar analysis

1696
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,060
um probably worse with reflected stuff

1697
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,140
like ever like

1698
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,880
this is what the different overseas and

1699
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,360
drops says about what they offer

1700
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,940
uh

1701
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,840
uh what is clear is that 3dp when

1702
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,260
reading when specifying this thought

1703
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:49,320
that they basically got dtls same

1704
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,659
property as dtls over UDP they

1705
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:52,920
definitely thought they got replay

1706
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,179
protection for example

1707
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:00,300
in the last version of satp over details

1708
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,360
over satp because five we have made a

1709
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,780
very thorough list of exact properties

1710
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,880
that are provided I think that's a

1711
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,580
general recommendation it should be easy

1712
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,640
to see what is provided and what is not

1713
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,739
provided even if you're not an expert in

1714
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:20,580
sctp next

1715
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:25,620
uh yeah and this is analysis of the what

1716
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,440
is broken

1717
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,199
um

1718
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:34,199
satp was all definitely does not offer

1719
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:36,840
shank origin authentication for example

1720
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,699
uh like it it promises uh then it all

1721
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:43,920
the other most other things whether it

1722
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,100
promises or not otherwise you can say it

1723
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,500
doesn't offer them or it offer them in a

1724
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,080
weak way

1725
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,620
detail RFC 6083

1726
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:59,880
is a better dtls uses directional keys

1727
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,120
and it uses single Mac to use the

1728
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,600
message so you don't break integrity and

1729
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,260
you don't weaken confidentiality

1730
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,820
these issues had a worse effect on

1731
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:15,000
details over satp piece in the version 4

1732
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,060
because it uses several records per user

1733
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,620
message in zero five

1734
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:26,460
issue one to four should be sold as but

1735
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,100
in general all the attacks on the

1736
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,739
availability is probably remaining this

1737
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:34,679
is also a bit harder to analyze a lot of

1738
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,620
the handling is implementation specific

1739
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,679
and not really mandated by the

1740
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:42,780
specifications

1741
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:43,739
yeah

1742
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:46,459
okay Michael

1743
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,480
Jackson can you go back to the the list

1744
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,739
of issues

1745
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:55,620
right at the beginning which which side

1746
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,840
we reactors

1747
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,760
come on we can start with that we know

1748
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,020
the next one

1749
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,540
yeah so the first one the reflect the

1750
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,580
reflection stuff that is an issue in

1751
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,420
HTTP auth we we missed putting in a

1752
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,360
directional specific information in the

1753
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,719
in the computation however

1754
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:19,679
um for dtls over HTTP that shouldn't be

1755
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,260
an issue because the dtls keys are

1756
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,900
directional specific so in attacker

1757
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,179
should not be able to

1758
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:30,300
in to reflect user data and it's being

1759
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,300
delivered so that's not an issue I think

1760
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:37,380
for details over HTTP yeah it could be

1761
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,400
an availability issue I'm asking about

1762
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,380
inserting data which looks like it's

1763
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,179
coming from the peer and it's not and

1764
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,340
that is not working it would not be

1765
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:51,120
accepted exactly the next slide

1766
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,219
which is the replay stuff and the replay

1767
01:18:53,219 --> 01:18:56,219
stuff sap authentication does not

1768
01:18:56,219 --> 01:18:59,159
provide any better replay protection as

1769
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:01,920
the base protocol does that's stated in

1770
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,940
the document and dtls does this by doing

1771
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,340
renegotiations at least in the the old

1772
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,800
one where dtls 1.0 was used and you

1773
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,100
could do renegotiations that's the whole

1774
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,560
reason why we did add

1775
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,080
support for renegotiation and it is a

1776
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,360
dance with sequence numbers and and kind

1777
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,520
of stuff but we do not have text in

1778
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,100
there when you do this because you can

1779
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,840
do this because sequence numbers are

1780
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,400
wrapping you can do this because you're

1781
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,380
using an extension at that point or

1782
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,560
Define we just didn't specify that next

1783
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,780
slide

1784
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,699
the third one is something we just

1785
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:40,080
didn't know

1786
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,080
so and yeah it's just there I don't know

1787
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,320
if it's usable but we just didn't know

1788
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,900
um four and five is this I don't think

1789
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:53,100
you can do anything except availability

1790
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,360
things

1791
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,179
however and it's in my view an attacker

1792
01:19:57,179 --> 01:19:59,040
which can take a packet

1793
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:03,420
and uh send it in in in a wrong in the

1794
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,880
other direction might also be able to

1795
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,780
just drop packets so it's your host then

1796
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,360
anyway at least this was

1797
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,640
at the point of time we did satp auth

1798
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,199
there was not

1799
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:19,080
a huge difference between an attacker

1800
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,540
who could read packets and who could

1801
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,780
send packets compared to one who can

1802
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,820
take out packets

1803
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,159
but that might have changed I don't know

1804
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:31,800
but availability might be an issue yes

1805
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,920
but can be in other ways

1806
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,040
and most of the stuff we can fix in a

1807
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,780
simple way which I will cover in the

1808
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,280
next you'll be up to next I wanted to

1809
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,080
get in here more as individual make one

1810
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,840
quick comment the word replay is being

1811
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,580
tossed around a little bit cavalierly

1812
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:52,920
insecurity replay attacks usually refer

1813
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,400
to tax where the attacker can replay the

1814
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,280
attacking data at the time and place of

1815
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,679
her choosing these replay attacks here

1816
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,780
they're they are replay attack they are

1817
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,179
much more specific because they the

1818
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:09,060
replay can only happen exactly when the

1819
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,100
when the sequence number rolls over and

1820
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,540
comes back around so it's much more

1821
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,640
limited than we usually see for replay

1822
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,500
attack and security context it is

1823
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,600
nonetheless uh an actual attack it's a

1824
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,739
nice piece analysis thank you thank you

1825
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,239
yeah I just wanted to briefly say thank

1826
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,600
you for breaking our stuff

1827
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,340
[Laughter]

1828
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,400
valuable things that that we can hear is

1829
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,560
that our security has got problems and I

1830
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,120
look forward to the revisions that will

1831
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,679
come from this it's a huge huge

1832
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:40,580
contribution thank you

1833
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:49,980
oh okay and I think Now for Something

1834
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,500
Completely Different

1835
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:55,620
we have Michael do we find it it's this

1836
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:00,080
one right yes

1837
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,820
so we're on sttp security this time

1838
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,480
Michael yeah um I just forgot that yeah

1839
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,580
thank you for the analysis so it's it's

1840
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,699
uh it wasn't up to

1841
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:14,699
whatever our our view that we should

1842
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:16,620
need to put in some directional stuff

1843
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,600
because when we did satp authentication

1844
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,860
we did it

1845
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,760
in the framework of

1846
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,040
protecting certain control chunks which

1847
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,260
we didn't even foresee that they will

1848
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,640
see there will be

1849
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,320
a lot of them

1850
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,739
okay so what's I'm talking about a Biz

1851
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:35,760
document

1852
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,540
um

1853
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,219
um I started on working on this this

1854
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,920
document way before not way before but

1855
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,780
before

1856
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,600
um I got aware of the security

1857
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,000
um issues so

1858
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,280
um

1859
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,640
years ago there was a document sap auth

1860
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,860
based someone from submitted by someone

1861
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,540
I don't know

1862
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:00,620
um basically covering some

1863
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,600
textual improvements where some of the

1864
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,699
wording was not clear enough for the

1865
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:08,699
author and he should and he wanted to

1866
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:10,500
improve that so that's definitely

1867
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,380
something one should we should we we we

1868
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:15,480
would include

1869
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,400
um the motivation of this was based on

1870
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,960
the discussion

1871
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,960
um I had with the authors of the dtls

1872
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,860
document

1873
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,480
basically

1874
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,520
um the mandatory to implement algorithm

1875
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,719
is Shao one hmaker using Shawan and

1876
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,360
there is the wish to

1877
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,060
um have other ones deal with this stuff

1878
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:39,000
uh and in particular so defined are

1879
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,880
actually two so the dtls over HTTP

1880
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,060
wanted to use uh the other one and make

1881
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,880
sure from the API perspective that they

1882
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,820
can do this so this is also something

1883
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,560
um we would

1884
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,400
um uh add there that you have a way to

1885
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,620
control this and I think to cover most

1886
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:01,380
of the stuff uh John has brought up is

1887
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,340
one is to include a direction specific

1888
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,980
data in the computation of the of the

1889
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:10,920
mac and basically this can be

1890
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,480
um this is part numbers and the

1891
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,820
verification tag from the from the

1892
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:18,000
common header so this is not equal and

1893
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,719
and you can just do that and this third

1894
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:25,380
theoretical one I think could be solved

1895
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,520
by

1896
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,860
um doing a key derivation

1897
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:29,760
um

1898
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,300
a directional specific one

1899
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,000
um and and then algorithm specific one

1900
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,880
so the status of the document is

1901
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,719
um

1902
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:43,380
I submitted the zero zero version as

1903
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:47,580
similar as possible to the existing RFC

1904
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,679
um going through formatting it as an

1905
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,480
internet draft but using the same XML

1906
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,940
sources I got from the RFC editor I

1907
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:56,520
updated it to XML V3 because it was

1908
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,860
written earlier and I did some

1909
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,780
wordsmithing and updating the reference

1910
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:03,480
about the old ionic in considerations

1911
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,480
are there no technical content has been

1912
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,320
changed because next slide

1913
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:10,920
um

1914
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,199
is that one yeah because

1915
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,500
um the question is whether this should

1916
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,780
be adopted as a working group item and

1917
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,500
if yes then it might be better to to

1918
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,179
change to a working group document and

1919
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:26,460
then do any substantial changes there so

1920
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:29,040
you can easily see them in the issue in

1921
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,500
the data tracker there

1922
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,719
of course when we do this work any

1923
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:36,239
additional input will be incorporated

1924
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:39,179
but you see the scope of the the changes

1925
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:41,880
we wanted to make also Magnus I think

1926
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,580
brought up going away from the hmac

1927
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,400
staff generalizing to a Mac allowing

1928
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,540
more algorithms

1929
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,100
that's it for my side

1930
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,360
questions

1931
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,040
but actually not a question I think it's

1932
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,500
we need to do do something with sap auth

1933
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,420
it's it needs to be improved here so

1934
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,580
it's just I mean we need to fix the

1935
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:18,440
issues brought up by John yeah

1936
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:21,120
and I guess the polls giving you the

1937
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,159
answers about working group adoption

1938
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:25,980
and people haven't yet read it okay

1939
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:29,100
um and given the motivational speech is

1940
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,260
going on today it may be a good thing to

1941
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,940
read so we will we will not make any

1942
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,440
determination about the working group

1943
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,900
adoption at this moment please read this

1944
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,400
okay

1945
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,800
thank you

1946
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,699
okay next

1947
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,820
now for something not completely

1948
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,059
different

1949
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,260
they are different

1950
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:58,760
not completely though no

1951
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,699
so um my name is Westland talk about the

1952
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:05,100
details over satp uh

1953
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,620
so the latest version is o5

1954
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,300
um talk a little bit status we have

1955
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,820
three issues here on the list uh and a

1956
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,440
little bit dealing with those what you

1957
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,900
just talked about uh so but let's take

1958
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,460
the next slide

1959
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,840
so

1960
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,159
um

1961
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,659
the current status is where we've been

1962
01:27:21,659 --> 01:27:23,100
working through with Martin Thompson's

1963
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,380
review we mostly addressed the issues

1964
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,100
there

1965
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:31,199
uh next slide is it yeah um

1966
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,659
there are a few that's dependent on the

1967
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:36,239
issues uh especially on the detailers

1968
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,460
versioning Etc which will wait what to

1969
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:40,860
do resolve before going ahead and do

1970
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:43,020
those text changes

1971
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,260
um but yeah I think a big big relation

1972
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:49,199
is to regards to this SD of security

1973
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,480
issues so but uh let's go forward to

1974
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,980
that issue then

1975
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,800
so uh detail is over HTTP in this

1976
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,699
version

1977
01:27:56,699 --> 01:28:00,179
has this very higher than a dependency

1978
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:03,659
on SD Western 683 has because it's what

1979
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:07,739
ensures that the detailers record as a

1980
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:09,719
part of the user message protected user

1981
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:11,600
message fragments are in the right order

1982
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,000
therefore any replays Etc is really bad

1983
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,340
for us because that means that you could

1984
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:20,159
actually affect the resulting message

1985
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,139
message Integrity if you actually get

1986
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:24,480
through a data record

1987
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,560
that's verifies so a straight Replay

1988
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,380
that actually fits correctly could mean

1989
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,760
that you actually get corrupted message

1990
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,580
through that would be really bad there

1991
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,139
are mitigations here and I think we

1992
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:40,500
could go on to that next slide

1993
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,840
um

1994
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,120
for the reflection attacks Etc uh and

1995
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,400
for the reflection attacks

1996
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,960
we could I mean fix the sap auth

1997
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:54,320
that takes care of this would fix that

1998
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,139
and I think uh re-keying is is

1999
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:00,600
a requirement from detailer so sdp is a

2000
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,400
fairly straightforward making it very

2001
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,199
clear that you need to retire the any

2002
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:08,820
sap auth Keys before you wrapped so

2003
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,659
um

2004
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:11,940
the fact that this is that I'm going to

2005
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,820
have implementation impact on sdb worth

2006
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:18,179
and the stack which means that some of

2007
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:20,520
our baselines they go into this is

2008
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,320
affected but I think it's the other

2009
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,659
question going forward here is is if

2010
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,159
these mitigations are sufficient

2011
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,960
implementable to reaching those security

2012
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,500
goals we see as being sufficient for for

2013
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,260
example 3D PPS and 5D deployments there

2014
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:37,260
in very long in sessions uh so go to

2015
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,800
next slide

2016
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,900
um I really would like to encourage

2017
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,880
people to guess about these two I'll

2018
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,040
have some insight and need for this to

2019
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,500
actually do a security analysis in terms

2020
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,840
of what what their stands are

2021
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,880
um the other aspect we see is that the

2022
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,820
details of sdp is complex there's a lot

2023
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,880
of corner cases Etc to avoid the CTP

2024
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,920
implementation impact

2025
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,139
we have some ideas how we could actually

2026
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:07,380
do detail as more in satp

2027
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,500
which would be simpler enable a less

2028
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,380
complex detail less

2029
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,639
details implementation requirements will

2030
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,159
be simple Etc and and we are actually

2031
01:30:17,159 --> 01:30:19,020
proposing here to actually

2032
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,540
uh that we would actually quote write an

2033
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,340
individual draft for an alternative to

2034
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,760
just present as as we will have a delay

2035
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,340
at this stage until satp watch is fixed

2036
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,139
if you stay on the current path

2037
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:33,060
and and that might be that that

2038
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,520
alternative path is is equally fast or

2039
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,580
faster to basically it's as fast as to

2040
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,860
complete and provides Better Properties

2041
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,860
but uh you know we want to investigate

2042
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,659
that a bit

2043
01:30:45,659 --> 01:30:46,380
um

2044
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:50,040
so um next slide

2045
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,679
so if anyone has any comments about the

2046
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:57,440
sap host aspects it's now is a good time

2047
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,340
the next issue we have is is about which

2048
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:06,739
detailers Stacks we should support

2049
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,500
ing only detail as 1.3 would make our

2050
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,219
life easier from a spec perspective it

2051
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:17,159
will also improve I think

2052
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:19,260
the potential for an interoperability

2053
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,060
failure if one side supports only

2054
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,080
details 1.3 and the other only 1.2

2055
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,840
um so

2056
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,699
um

2057
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:31,860
but what was raised in the discussion on

2058
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,000
the main list when I brought this up

2059
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,800
earlier was that yeah the availability

2060
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,260
detail is 1.3 Stacks is currently not

2061
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,159
great

2062
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,580
it is much more limited details 1.2

2063
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:44,040
we know that false SSL is in beta it's

2064
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,440
announced I talked to

2065
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,560
Summit Mozilla and yeah the NSS is

2066
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,000
coming there but they will not have

2067
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,620
connection ID

2068
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,600
and then important aspects of this is

2069
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,420
that we did details over STP that's

2070
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,040
currently in the draft

2071
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,139
we do have requirements on connection

2072
01:32:01,139 --> 01:32:02,460
IDs

2073
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:05,760
turning off replay and we need

2074
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,760
large record sizes and or

2075
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,739
you couldn't need to support negotiation

2076
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:13,620
to smaller maximum record size for

2077
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,260
detailers these are feature we are kind

2078
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,940
of you need to have for implementation

2079
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,100
to work so

2080
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,179
um so

2081
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:22,440
Michael

2082
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,600
a question comment

2083
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,980
uh

2084
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:27,719
yeah I have a question

2085
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:30,900
um is it relevant what open source

2086
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,699
implementation open source details

2087
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:34,100
implementations

2088
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,860
provide since there are API issues so

2089
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:42,239
I mean I I are the iprs outside of

2090
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,820
what you need in a dtls implementation

2091
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,739
and

2092
01:32:46,739 --> 01:32:51,780
no I think it's uh so I I

2093
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,760
let's see how I should answer that

2094
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,280
question uh

2095
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,199
I think it brought talk about open

2096
01:32:58,199 --> 01:32:59,820
source details implementation here is

2097
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:00,900
about

2098
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,100
uh

2099
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,739
if how you

2100
01:33:04,739 --> 01:33:07,380
get an implementation of details of satp

2101
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:09,719
in place and and that

2102
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:12,600
uh I mean details taxes is not trivial

2103
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,100
there's some lead time if you would if

2104
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,320
you would go order one and want to have

2105
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,239
it tested secure Etc it's going to take

2106
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:19,860
quite a while and these extra features

2107
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,360
you're probably gonna have to order

2108
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,460
that's that's I think is the concern

2109
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:24,300
here

2110
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,659
uh but my point was can I use for so can

2111
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:29,400
I use an open source

2112
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,340
details implementation to implement

2113
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:35,580
details over scdp since it has some

2114
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:38,639
some patents part of that is patent

2115
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:41,460
protected so I'm I'm just not sure what

2116
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:42,600
can I

2117
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,679
what why okay so if if the IPR claims we

2118
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:48,659
have for example have is not covering

2119
01:33:48,659 --> 01:33:51,420
details as it is I mean if it's okay I'm

2120
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,699
just asking can I yeah can I suggest

2121
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:55,739
that this uh uh discussion be taken

2122
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:59,400
offline the usability of Open Source

2123
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,760
libraries in non-open Source has a long

2124
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,920
track record but what you can do depends

2125
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,960
on the exact licensing condition of the

2126
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,639
specific Library which is not a real

2127
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,980
good topic to discuss here I was just

2128
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,960
asking because both SSL is given there

2129
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,060
so it's um I I said I think I think

2130
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:16,920
you've opened up a rat hole um I suggest

2131
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,840
you find legal counsel to to work

2132
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,460
through the license details yeah

2133
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,580
yeah now yeah yes I mean my point to

2134
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,020
bring this up we're just saying what's

2135
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:26,760
what's looks appears to be the current

2136
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,980
situation of public known

2137
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,020
implementations that's the only thing I

2138
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,120
wanted to State here

2139
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,780
so and next next slides uh

2140
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:39,600
ah okay but is there anyone having any

2141
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,820
more input I mean otherwise what was

2142
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:43,560
raised on the list was saying uh no we

2143
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,860
don't want to go to 1.3 and I guess if

2144
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:49,020
no one has more input that might be

2145
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:51,900
where we'll be stuck here Martin

2146
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,219
now

2147
01:34:53,219 --> 01:34:57,179
uh yeah Martin dude Google um no hats uh

2148
01:34:57,179 --> 01:34:58,800
like the future's bigger than the past

2149
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,080
if if this is a much shorter document

2150
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:02,699
and you're not like desperate to ship it

2151
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:03,480
tomorrow

2152
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,280
as long as we feel reasonably confident

2153
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,380
that

2154
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:09,719
dtls13 is on road maps of major

2155
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:12,620
implementations

2156
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,760
um you know if we could eliminate a lot

2157
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,920
of stuff like that's good

2158
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,500
so yeah and I think it's especially

2159
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,139
dependent on if we can take this

2160
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:25,440
alternative road that might reduce this

2161
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,120
list of features needed

2162
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,820
which makes it even easier um so I think

2163
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:32,460
yeah I've it might be just best to delay

2164
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,440
this question a bit and see where how

2165
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,000
long it takes to fix the rest of the

2166
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,679
aspects here

2167
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:38,760
um

2168
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,760
so uh on this last issue there's one

2169
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,940
important aspect has to do with uh some

2170
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:48,480
Marty brought this up and

2171
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,639
background here is really that yeah you

2172
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,679
have those things that are detailed as

2173
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:54,420
message between the stacks between the

2174
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:56,699
endpoints the handshake the errors and

2175
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:58,500
errors or close notify which is

2176
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,960
terminated

2177
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:01,980
um

2178
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:06,000
we have 63 did stream zero in order

2179
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,219
delivery of these we changed this to any

2180
01:36:08,219 --> 01:36:10,320
stream Etc what Martin wrote up was

2181
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,120
saying well it might be hard to optimize

2182
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,219
this to ensure that you send the records

2183
01:36:14,219 --> 01:36:16,080
to the fast path and only take these

2184
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,840
messages to your slower path

2185
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:22,679
um so next slide

2186
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:24,420
uh

2187
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:26,639
one interesting question in this is the

2188
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,460
identification of these messages

2189
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,560
and that's actually I want to hopefully

2190
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,600
get some feedback on that eventually

2191
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,659
It's like because 1.3 Heights is what

2192
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:38,460
they are the content type is internal

2193
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,380
it's encrypted and

2194
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:43,380
Etc so the stack when it's processed you

2195
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:44,880
will know if it was oh this is a

2196
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,260
allergic message

2197
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:48,540
um not so

2198
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,760
but if you can actually be able to sort

2199
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,080
this out

2200
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,060
before you send them to the details

2201
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,260
implementation

2202
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,179
we need to have an identifier on them

2203
01:36:57,179 --> 01:36:59,060
being details message already being

2204
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:01,500
details records we protected user

2205
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,760
messages

2206
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:05,520
and and that ends up in a question is we

2207
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,639
are we okay to expose this it leads to I

2208
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:11,280
think some potentials for trying to

2209
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,159
Target these measures specifically in a

2210
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:17,040
low volume or something to to affect the

2211
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,219
session affecting availability

2212
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:22,860
I would say here and not really other

2213
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:24,000
things

2214
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,120
so and but one way of identifying was to

2215
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,520
do stick your ppid on this particular

2216
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,100
message that's headed for the the end

2217
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:35,159
stack not records but um if someone has

2218
01:37:35,159 --> 01:37:38,599
an input on this it would be great

2219
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,280
so

2220
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,139
um yeah come talk to me or send an email

2221
01:37:46,139 --> 01:37:47,040
or whatever

2222
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,920
um the timeline of this will be delayed

2223
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,080
I was hoping that we would actually have

2224
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,380
a chance of meeting the March deadline

2225
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:57,480
it doesn't look feasible now we need to

2226
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,820
fix this to be worth fixed or not use

2227
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:02,280
another version alternate detailer

2228
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:04,199
solution

2229
01:38:04,199 --> 01:38:05,520
um

2230
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,980
but I hope that we will be able to move

2231
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:09,780
forward in reasonable Pace here and we

2232
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,600
do try to update the drafts uh in not

2233
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,480
two extents but yeah and I think we

2234
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,940
might have to notify 3D people about

2235
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,400
these delays and the Securities should

2236
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,739
be listed both here so they are aware of

2237
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:24,000
it because

2238
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,420
so

2239
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,080
so therefore I would like to send an

2240
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,080
Ellis from this group to

2241
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,239
so

2242
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:35,219
yeah

2243
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:35,960
um

2244
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:39,620
any questions

2245
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:48,659
okay thank you clearly we need to gather

2246
01:38:48,659 --> 01:38:51,659
some momentum around the sctp and the

2247
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,820
authentication problems

2248
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,940
text and new techniques so we'll look

2249
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:59,000
forward to inputs on that

2250
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,760
we have next

2251
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,639
this okay uh

2252
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:08,219
I'm going to cut the announcements about

2253
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:10,739
Joe touche's UDP options and the related

2254
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:15,120
DPL pmtud for UDP options uh we're

2255
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:18,540
awaiting a revised ID from Joe touch

2256
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:20,880
which we intend to work in group last

2257
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,840
call

2258
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,580
so what

2259
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,199
if you're interested in an update that's

2260
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:28,139
the situation revised ID expected

2261
01:39:28,139 --> 01:39:30,900
shortly after this ITF so we'll move

2262
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,659
straight on to Michael Tucson on scdp

2263
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:36,360
UDP this is the individual draft go

2264
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,460
ahead Michael yeah this is an individual

2265
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:42,540
draft on next slide and

2266
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:45,060
um it basically

2267
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,139
um

2268
01:39:46,139 --> 01:39:48,960
deals with satp over UDP encapsulation

2269
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,260
so this is one of the possible ways to

2270
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:55,440
transfer sap over UDP through Legacy

2271
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,000
nuts and

2272
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,679
[Music]

2273
01:39:58,679 --> 01:40:00,000
um

2274
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,659
there's an RFC for it it's 69.51 it does

2275
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:06,780
not describe how to handle

2276
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:09,120
um in its packets containing an inner

2277
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,800
chunk because you have no verification

2278
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,239
tag you have no way to verify that this

2279
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:17,219
packet is really coming from your peers

2280
01:40:17,219 --> 01:40:19,800
so is that it has an impact on whether

2281
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,840
you should update your port numbers or

2282
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,239
not and

2283
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:27,960
um this issue is covered in the draft

2284
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,860
given there and uh I think when Magnus

2285
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:34,020
was already it was still

2286
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:36,139
transport ID

2287
01:40:36,139 --> 01:40:38,639
we asked how to progress and the

2288
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,800
argument was well maybe you just do a

2289
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,540
business document instead of having two

2290
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:46,020
small documents describing one thing

2291
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,260
and I asked um Martin got the same

2292
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:52,500
response so this is basically

2293
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:55,620
um uh

2294
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:59,179
the the the the first

2295
01:40:59,179 --> 01:41:03,000
document trying to join these both next

2296
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,100
slide

2297
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,380
um and I did what I did with the other

2298
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:09,960
documents submit zero zero as the

2299
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:13,020
original RFC changed the XML V3 and do

2300
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:14,940
some updates of the documents which were

2301
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,739
outdated

2302
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:17,760
um

2303
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,100
there are two implementations oh there

2304
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,780
are two open source implementations in

2305
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:23,699
corner sticks right now which is FreeBSD

2306
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:26,639
and Linux and both are covered on

2307
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:31,199
the RFC and the draft so both are

2308
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:31,920
um

2309
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,139
doing the right thing

2310
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:35,760
um but it's not documented in a single

2311
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,659
document right now in the idea is to

2312
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:40,860
um

2313
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,719
get this cleaned up

2314
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,580
which is I think the next slide right

2315
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:48,000
yep

2316
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,760
and of course we would incorporate any

2317
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,860
additional feedback coming up through

2318
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:56,340
any kind of discussion

2319
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:58,800
could ask the first question

2320
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,719
yeah the question is

2321
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,699
is the work can go better so at what

2322
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:03,960
point is if the working group is not

2323
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,460
adopting it it doesn't make sense to

2324
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,380
progress the document so

2325
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:09,600
it's an offer

2326
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,540
foreign

2327
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:14,699
do you think this has to be done by

2328
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:17,219
whenever there's time and resources sure

2329
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:19,920
so there I mean the implementations are

2330
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,440
there the draft describing the issue is

2331
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,560
there I can keep it updated it's just

2332
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,639
that

2333
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:27,840
um

2334
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,179
if if you're just looking based on the

2335
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:31,679
experience from the Linux people they

2336
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,480
they find the RFC but they don't find

2337
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,520
the draft describing what they also have

2338
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,560
to do so

2339
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,900
that's it

2340
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,540
okay any questions from anyone else I

2341
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:45,920
would say less pressure than Earth

2342
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,679
I I'd encourage feedback on this one um

2343
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,179
it's something we've talked about a

2344
01:42:51,179 --> 01:42:52,739
number of times please read it please

2345
01:42:52,739 --> 01:42:54,239
progress it please come and present

2346
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:57,239
again and let's ask those questions when

2347
01:42:57,239 --> 01:42:59,460
we got more people reading this because

2348
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:01,080
I I think it's something that should be

2349
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,000
of interest to this group given the

2350
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,840
previous work okay

2351
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:10,520
uh Michael not so fast

2352
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:17,159
okay so this is a document about

2353
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:20,760
um zero checksum next slide

2354
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,719
um SUV uses as a checksum CSC 32c which

2355
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,659
is a 32-bit checksum which needs some

2356
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:30,960
CPU Cycles to be computed and there are

2357
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,380
use cases which is webrtc in particular

2358
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,980
where you run HTTP over dtls so you have

2359
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:41,100
a much better protection of your packet

2360
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,619
from your lower layer than you get from

2361
01:43:43,619 --> 01:43:46,500
your CRC so

2362
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:49,800
um and there are people using webrtc on

2363
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,920
CPU constrained devices

2364
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,560
which just don't compute the CRC on the

2365
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,360
receive side because they can do this

2366
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,119
without breaking interoperability but

2367
01:44:00,119 --> 01:44:01,679
they can do it they can't do it on the

2368
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:05,940
sender side so the idea is to add to the

2369
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:08,280
handshake a parameter stating I'm

2370
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:11,400
willing to accept zero as a check sum

2371
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,080
and then you can do this in the

2372
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,000
handshake you can do it backwards

2373
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,679
compatible and then you don't have to

2374
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:19,260
compute the checksums anymore when you

2375
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:22,139
do the data transfer

2376
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:24,300
there are co-authors from Google trying

2377
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,460
willing to implement this into the

2378
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,739
what's the name Google webrtc

2379
01:44:28,739 --> 01:44:32,340
implementation used in Chrome there is

2380
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:35,340
a quarter from Mozilla I'm willing to

2381
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:37,679
integrate this into

2382
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,060
um the

2383
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:39,719
um

2384
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:43,199
Firefox browser and

2385
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:43,980
um

2386
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:45,600
so there is there is support from

2387
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,020
implementers uh next slide

2388
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:48,540
[Music]

2389
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:50,040
um

2390
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,199
and we have support in Wireshark we have

2391
01:44:52,199 --> 01:44:54,540
support and packet tool for doing tests

2392
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,119
um I'm working on a

2393
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,280
um on an implementation

2394
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,159
um and it's a very simple document but

2395
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:04,020
we need this document to get the

2396
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:07,139
assignment of this parameter so it's

2397
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:09,239
specification required

2398
01:45:09,239 --> 01:45:11,699
that's why it's here and that is a

2399
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:13,860
document I would say which is very

2400
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:14,940
simple

2401
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,179
could be progressed very fast and people

2402
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:20,580
would like to deploy this

2403
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:24,139
so same question as again

2404
01:45:24,139 --> 01:45:26,580
and we would integrate I mean we would

2405
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:28,500
integrate comments and we got comments

2406
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,760
from gory

2407
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,400
from Mike and from Ayana basically about

2408
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,940
we know we normally do in the INX

2409
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:39,060
section write the specific number

2410
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:42,179
so question two the document author do

2411
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:43,860
you want me to ask who's Reddit or do

2412
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,960
you want to give them a time to chew it

2413
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,760
over and get a better answer

2414
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,699
up to you

2415
01:45:49,699 --> 01:45:52,380
I guess we get the same answer yeah all

2416
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:55,020
right okay let's go um here we go who's

2417
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,239
who has read this document

2418
01:45:57,239 --> 01:45:58,440
um coming in

2419
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,500
no who has

2420
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,280
zero

2421
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,940
I'll come to the mic if you have any

2422
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:08,239
question

2423
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,380
you do exist

2424
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:15,119
we have

2425
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,159
a poll going on on questions

2426
01:46:17,159 --> 01:46:20,219
concurrently a higher last record so for

2427
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:23,580
specimens for specification required you

2428
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,739
actually don't need an RFC

2429
01:46:25,739 --> 01:46:28,199
you need a stable specification that's

2430
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:29,940
around

2431
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,760
right but it doesn't need to be done in

2432
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,280
a working group just saying

2433
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:40,080
and the stable specification is

2434
01:46:40,139 --> 01:46:42,380
a draft which has not changed any time

2435
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:45,840
or something that the uh Ayana will

2436
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,659
accept when they get the request

2437
01:46:48,659 --> 01:46:50,760
there should be a expert reviewer which

2438
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:53,480
might be even you

2439
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,460
I'm just pointing it out right so it's

2440
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:57,840
specification required is not RFC

2441
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,520
required

2442
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,080
um and and so there is the option

2443
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,900
right I'm going to ask an additional

2444
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:07,980
question

2445
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,020
um Lars is correct

2446
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:12,600
um but let's ask this question

2447
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,360
um who thinks this is a useful piece of

2448
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,000
work which is abbreviating wrk to doing

2449
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,560
this working group

2450
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,360
for the next group

2451
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,420
you for fun in the question to try and

2452
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:26,219
stimulate a response at this moment

2453
01:47:26,219 --> 01:47:28,440
because people might think this is a

2454
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,920
useful thing to do here even though

2455
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,239
um they haven't read it because it's

2456
01:47:33,239 --> 01:47:35,940
pretty clear what it's meant to do and I

2457
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:38,600
will keep talking I'll come to the mic

2458
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:41,340
ask any questions because we're seeing a

2459
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:43,739
response in the chat and we have Mike

2460
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:46,380
and Martin

2461
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:49,260
uh very quickly if you have

2462
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,360
specification required it could be

2463
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:54,360
published as a uh outside the working

2464
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:58,519
group uh I suppose is an option

2465
01:47:59,219 --> 01:48:02,219
thank you yeah possible yeah Martin Duke

2466
01:48:02,219 --> 01:48:02,940
Google

2467
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,500
um

2468
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,179
you know I asked the question about SCP

2469
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:07,800
working group a couple months ago and

2470
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,060
you told me there was no need now we

2471
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,460
have five drafts up for adoption

2472
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:12,560
um

2473
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,119
like so yeah I to be clear I've read

2474
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:17,340
zero of these drafts but I think the

2475
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:18,360
presentations have made a pretty

2476
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,340
convincing case for all of them you know

2477
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:23,219
addressed at some point and I I guess

2478
01:48:23,219 --> 01:48:24,239
the real question is working group

2479
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,820
bandwidth for the from the chairs like

2480
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:29,159
how many of these can we swallow at once

2481
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:31,980
um and do we need to like have some do

2482
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,659
we need this set up very quick working

2483
01:48:33,659 --> 01:48:35,340
group to clear through this backlog if

2484
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:37,080
these things are Urgent or not

2485
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,960
um okay we we will triage that question

2486
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,699
because we also see the same Community

2487
01:48:41,699 --> 01:48:44,100
uh making the responses for each of

2488
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,260
these drafts and we will check the work

2489
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:49,139
Cycles Etc yeah this particular draft is

2490
01:48:49,139 --> 01:48:51,679
is simple

2491
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:56,880
an additional comment yeah sort of I

2492
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,320
mean I got flashbacks to win Magnus and

2493
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,639
I were transporting these and we talked

2494
01:48:59,639 --> 01:49:00,840
about Dynasty people working group and

2495
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,520
the reason we didn't at the time was

2496
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,820
that we felt that the sdb community was

2497
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:07,739
too small and it did it wouldn't get

2498
01:49:07,739 --> 01:49:09,000
enough review and that might as well

2499
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,739
might have all changed but it doesn't

2500
01:49:10,739 --> 01:49:12,600
quite appear that way and so it's

2501
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,100
probably the best home is unfortunately

2502
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,080
still here

2503
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,060
we will look at that part of the problem

2504
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:20,580
space uh the answer to my poll is

2505
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:22,260
clearly people think this is a useful

2506
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:23,760
piece of work to do in this working

2507
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,460
group and so I'd encourage you to keep

2508
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,679
revising and come for an adoption call

2509
01:49:28,679 --> 01:49:31,320
in the future okay

2510
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:34,880
right uh

2511
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,420
did you want to say something

2512
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,139
I guess I need to pull my and to get

2513
01:49:43,139 --> 01:49:45,300
vigorous about the discussion about once

2514
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:47,460
uh just ensuring that I I think this

2515
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,020
document makes sense in the context this

2516
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,179
it just needs to be very clear on on its

2517
01:49:51,179 --> 01:49:52,860
very limited applicability or is saying

2518
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:53,880
the requirement that I think it's

2519
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:56,100
decently clear already so it's not a

2520
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:59,520
problem but uh yeah so yeah because

2521
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,800
running without checksums verifying

2522
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,560
ports Etc over the internet and having

2523
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,480
no additional mechanisms would be a bad

2524
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,500
idea

2525
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:10,619
from my perspective exactly the ietf has

2526
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:12,600
been through this process in a much more

2527
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,460
torturous way and I think we can make

2528
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:15,900
good recommendations on the

2529
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,540
applicability for this

2530
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:20,280
and we should keep moving because we are

2531
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,500
a little time left but we have a couple

2532
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:26,960
of talks so we should is Nicholas online

2533
01:50:29,699 --> 01:50:32,400
she is Nicholas your slide deck is ready

2534
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,780
please present

2535
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:36,119
can you hear me

2536
01:50:36,119 --> 01:50:38,880
yes please go ahead thank you so next

2537
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,360
slide please

2538
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:47,040
uh so this draft is uh activities you

2539
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,619
have been presenting in ITF uh in

2540
01:50:49,619 --> 01:50:50,880
different working groups and in

2541
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,000
particular in a quick working group The

2542
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,940
Main Idea here on this description is

2543
01:50:56,940 --> 01:51:00,119
so these first slides are how to quickly

2544
01:51:00,119 --> 01:51:01,800
catch up with the activity about

2545
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:07,020
catching up and on the boundaries so in

2546
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:09,060
the satellite industry there are some

2547
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:11,940
cases where it takes a lot of time for

2548
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:15,480
the condition control to quickly ramp up

2549
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:18,239
to the high bdb that is available so

2550
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:19,980
this is an experiment we have been we

2551
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:22,139
have done where we have been downloading

2552
01:51:22,139 --> 01:51:24,659
and made with quick and we could have

2553
01:51:24,659 --> 01:51:28,380
seen that basically on red and the

2554
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:31,619
bottom right part of the slide it took a

2555
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:33,960
while for quick to actually converge to

2556
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:37,080
what was the bandwidth uh the bottleneck

2557
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,420
that I read

2558
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:42,540
um so we have been thinking that storing

2559
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:44,460
the idea of knowing what was the best

2560
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:47,639
characteristics uh and using it to New

2561
01:51:47,639 --> 01:51:51,179
connections could be very interesting

2562
01:51:51,179 --> 01:51:52,199
um

2563
01:51:52,199 --> 01:51:55,260
the thing is you should not do that uh

2564
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,300
without any care so you have to be

2565
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,679
careful about how to do that and and

2566
01:52:00,679 --> 01:52:03,480
stop doing it if you find that anything

2567
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:06,000
has changed in network

2568
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,780
um next slide please

2569
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:11,520
so we have been proposing different type

2570
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:15,179
of uh documents to cover this issue uh

2571
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:18,540
in the last summer we there had been a

2572
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:20,040
adoption core in the Creek Coffee group

2573
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,320
for two drafts so basically the first

2574
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,199
one is careful regime is how you can

2575
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:26,639
store computed constant control

2576
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,380
parameters

2577
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:28,920
um

2578
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,780
to actually modify the Construction

2579
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:32,760
Control behavior of subsequent

2580
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:35,340
connections let's say and the first

2581
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:37,440
connection I understood I was using a

2582
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,540
satellite link and on the next

2583
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:42,480
connection to the same peer I just want

2584
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,480
to use and

2585
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:48,719
previously computed control parameters

2586
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,780
um we also had another draft which was a

2587
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,400
specific implementation of that issue so

2588
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:56,100
we have basically the bdb frame

2589
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,480
extension for quick that has been

2590
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,280
implemented in Pico quick and tested

2591
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,679
over a real satellite Networks

2592
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:04,080
this is how to store and exchange the

2593
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:08,040
completed values uh between peers

2594
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,840
so we have been populating that to Quick

2595
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,300
working group and

2596
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,619
um

2597
01:53:13,619 --> 01:53:16,440
basically the discussion the conclusion

2598
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:19,139
of the a different call was that

2599
01:53:19,139 --> 01:53:21,480
supportment space is more broadly to do

2600
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:23,400
with consistent control and not really

2601
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:26,219
quick specific

2602
01:53:26,219 --> 01:53:30,840
um indeed uh we need to must we this

2603
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:33,000
solution must to effectively share the

2604
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,820
capacity with all the transports and

2605
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:38,340
um maybe there is a way to do that with

2606
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:40,980
all the transports so that's why we are

2607
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:43,800
here and to see if there are any

2608
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,619
discussions here that are related to and

2609
01:53:46,619 --> 01:53:50,659
relevant for the tsv WG

2610
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:53,400
um basically this what are the

2611
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:56,040
Construction Control items that we think

2612
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,020
could be interesting for the group

2613
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:00,119
um so if we assume that we have had a

2614
01:54:00,119 --> 01:54:02,159
first connection that I finished and the

2615
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:04,440
information has been stored

2616
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,100
um

2617
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,260
we think a question an open question

2618
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:09,000
that we have is

2619
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,940
um what what event information you

2620
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:14,159
you can obtain to change that the path

2621
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,020
has not changed that much so we're

2622
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,639
seeing that for example if you lose back

2623
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:19,980
if you lose packets after sending the

2624
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:23,520
first ADW uh there should be some

2625
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,040
problem in the network so you may not uh

2626
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:27,780
resume to the previous construction

2627
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:30,239
parameters you can use a minimum entity

2628
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:33,659
values you can also use the interpack

2629
01:54:33,659 --> 01:54:36,659
enter packets time the interpacking time

2630
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:38,820
on other activities we have measured

2631
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:41,159
that this metric was very useful to

2632
01:54:41,159 --> 01:54:43,440
detect conception in the network

2633
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,780
so we think there is this discussion

2634
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:48,360
here uh we have discussed some

2635
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,000
algorithms in the draft that we have

2636
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,320
been we have posted recently

2637
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:57,360
um then when you know that the path has

2638
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,420
been checked how do you carefully jump

2639
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:02,460
uh you may not want to use to go

2640
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:04,199
directly to what was the previously

2641
01:55:04,199 --> 01:55:06,780
measured bandwidth so you may want to be

2642
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:09,199
careful in that and some sort of

2643
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:12,659
specific slow sort algorithm

2644
01:55:12,659 --> 01:55:15,800
um let's say uh you just did the jump

2645
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,659
how did you react if you see any

2646
01:55:18,659 --> 01:55:20,100
Collision

2647
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:21,780
um in the network

2648
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:25,500
and also Implement when Christiano

2649
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,860
implemented that in uh Pico quick we saw

2650
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:30,420
that there are some aspects that are

2651
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:31,860
very specific on the construction

2652
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:33,659
control that you have been using if you

2653
01:55:33,659 --> 01:55:36,300
use cubic or Reno it's different

2654
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,060
um you may have I start or I start plus

2655
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:41,460
plus uh making your Construction Control

2656
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:44,940
going out of the slow starts so you this

2657
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:46,260
is something that we think is very

2658
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:49,380
interesting to discuss and these items

2659
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:52,679
are currently discussed in the in the

2660
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:55,619
current version of the draft uh next

2661
01:55:55,619 --> 01:55:58,219
slide please

2662
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:01,739
that's what I'm saying that are related

2663
01:56:01,739 --> 01:56:04,139
to transports but not maybe third

2664
01:56:04,139 --> 01:56:06,600
relevant 40s vwg

2665
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,940
um it's basically how do the clean tasks

2666
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:11,900
for this jump because in the quick

2667
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:14,219
implementation we have been using the

2668
01:56:14,219 --> 01:56:16,500
Sierra TT and the TLs certificate

2669
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,780
signaling or we at least we use a

2670
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:21,139
specific frame that is protected by TLs

2671
01:56:21,139 --> 01:56:25,320
but the problem is that when you use

2672
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,139
um you may you may end up being very

2673
01:56:28,139 --> 01:56:29,639
specific on

2674
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:31,560
both Construction Control and the series

2675
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,960
visions that you have you are using

2676
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:36,659
basically to know what do you send and

2677
01:56:36,659 --> 01:56:38,940
when do you send it and how protected

2678
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:41,040
this information is

2679
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:44,219
and also another aspect is really the

2680
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:46,800
real system performances of that

2681
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,600
and that is not covered in the draft for

2682
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,940
the moment but in the end

2683
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:51,600
um

2684
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:53,400
we have been pushing out for this

2685
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,199
working quick cooking group we've been

2686
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:58,699
said that maybe this should be

2687
01:56:58,699 --> 01:57:02,159
addressed with a more wider view so we

2688
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:04,139
were wondering if there is any interest

2689
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:07,440
in the csgwg to is there any appetite

2690
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,520
for this work and if you would want to

2691
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,980
to join us as we seek to define the

2692
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:17,659
appropriate details of such solution

2693
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,199
thank you Nicholas any questions to

2694
01:57:22,199 --> 01:57:24,678
Nicholas

2695
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:29,219
okay we'll take peers you have peers

2696
01:57:29,219 --> 01:57:30,960
please come to the mic

2697
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:34,139
uh hi yeah um I was just wondering

2698
01:57:34,139 --> 01:57:35,699
uh this has been going this has been

2699
01:57:35,699 --> 01:57:36,599
used

2700
01:57:36,599 --> 01:57:39,780
um by TCP in um Linux kernel for some

2701
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,760
time like TCP metrics or whether you've

2702
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,179
looked at the uh how that works

2703
01:57:45,179 --> 01:57:47,940
um with in comparison to the approaches

2704
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:49,199
you've been considering because it

2705
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:52,139
caches like a sea wind rtt

2706
01:57:52,139 --> 01:57:53,940
and then it obviously

2707
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,920
um reuses those for

2708
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,239
the different congestion control

2709
01:57:57,239 --> 01:58:00,739
algorithms that are kicking off

2710
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:06,780
yeah um so these thank you we there we

2711
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,420
have been looking at that uh and also we

2712
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,580
wanted to have this kind of TCP metrics

2713
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:15,500
save for quick and in a way that is

2714
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:18,060
interoperable in a way that the client

2715
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,920
can participate in the decision on

2716
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:23,540
whether this Matrix is used or not

2717
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:26,580
okay yeah so I guess it was just useful

2718
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,739
to look at how that that's been working

2719
01:58:28,739 --> 01:58:30,119
to inform

2720
01:58:30,119 --> 01:58:33,239
how you might kind of start do the same

2721
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:36,239
thing it obviously works reasonably well

2722
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:37,560
yeah

2723
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:40,280
indeed

2724
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:42,780
so they have timeouts and stuff like

2725
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:46,080
that in the in the TCP metrics

2726
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,119
um so they they don't last forever and I

2727
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:51,000
don't know I'm not quite sure about the

2728
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,940
some algorithms around that but anyway

2729
01:58:53,940 --> 01:58:55,860
okay that's good you're looking at it

2730
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:58,320
Pierce could you send a email to the

2731
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,440
list please can I add an email to the

2732
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,239
list with what you just said that would

2733
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:05,460
be so helpful okay yeah I think I did

2734
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:07,860
very briefly I think it was mentioned on

2735
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:09,060
the Quick List

2736
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:11,099
and I mentioned it yeah but then it kind

2737
01:59:11,099 --> 01:59:13,260
of went over here so then okay I can do

2738
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:15,599
that yeah and that'll be so helpful and

2739
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:16,800
while we're talking about where it might

2740
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,840
be going uh I think it's the queue for

2741
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:21,599
Martin to come to the mic for one minute

2742
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,520
yeah uh I just want to announce to

2743
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,020
people uh many of you probably remember

2744
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:28,260
from tsv area 114 a discussion about now

2745
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:29,699
could you ask control working group

2746
01:59:29,699 --> 01:59:31,020
possibility

2747
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:32,699
um that chartering work is still going

2748
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:34,679
along in the background and for those of

2749
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:36,599
you who might be interested it will be a

2750
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:40,860
side meeting at 5 p.m on Thursday uh

2751
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:42,840
please come by if this is up your alley

2752
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:45,119
thank you

2753
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,900
thank you

2754
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:54,960
so thank you Nicholas as a chair and we

2755
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,360
will encourage discussion of that item

2756
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,780
on the list I think we've had feedback

2757
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:03,599
for that particular document in various

2758
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:05,639
places in the ietf so I'd encourage you

2759
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:07,800
to carry on working on it and we will

2760
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,920
try and find a home working with our ID

2761
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,360
obviously Thursday is an interestingly

2762
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:15,360
to attend if you possibly can and I'll

2763
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,400
take my mask off to stand here to put

2764
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:20,280
yet another flavor on the whole story

2765
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,380
um which is a draft that I produced a

2766
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:25,020
little while ago which may or may not be

2767
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:27,780
related to all the story so next slide

2768
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:29,880
please

2769
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,900
um okay this slide kind of captures what

2770
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:36,239
I was trying to do the ITF has said

2771
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:39,179
about much about congestion control in

2772
02:00:39,179 --> 02:00:41,280
the past much of it has prevented a

2773
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,020
meltdown congestion collapse on

2774
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:45,599
starvation of the internet

2775
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:49,380
does Our advice still apply hmm we

2776
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:51,420
should perhaps check this there's more

2777
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:54,360
than 40 references which are informative

2778
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:56,820
on this and about 10 which are normative

2779
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:58,320
descriptions of congestion control

2780
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,440
things you need to do next

2781
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,980
in 2019 and I decided to write a

2782
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:07,260
four-page document on the core things

2783
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,420
that would encourage a cc to play well

2784
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:11,040
what happens if you make a new

2785
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,840
congestion controller what would you be

2786
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,360
needed and next

2787
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:19,380
it took more than four pages next

2788
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:21,960
so um I wrote a draft I presented in

2789
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:24,000
Singapore you might go what happened

2790
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,980
well what happened is we failed to meet

2791
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:28,679
as a community face to face and this

2792
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:31,260
actually is more I think of a design

2793
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:34,020
team type activity than it is of a

2794
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:36,659
design activity so I wanted to resurrect

2795
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:38,460
it now we are starting to meet face to

2796
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:40,679
face and I would encourage you to come

2797
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:43,980
around talk about whether the ITF has

2798
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:45,960
made the right recommendations in the

2799
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,360
BCP series for its congestion control

2800
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:51,119
and maybe we can add another RFC or

2801
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:53,520
update one or maybe we'll just conclude

2802
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:55,020
with a bit of guidance this is actually

2803
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:57,540
okay I don't have an opinion but I've

2804
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:59,099
tried to write a draft and this is the

2805
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:01,440
draft story and we're now at draft seven

2806
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:04,739
please go quickly next please

2807
02:02:04,739 --> 02:02:06,060
um there's a principles of congestion

2808
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:08,460
control and the key thing that I'm

2809
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:11,219
motivating is that things have changed

2810
02:02:11,219 --> 02:02:13,500
we absolutely must be preventing

2811
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:15,780
persistent congestion that's things like

2812
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:18,179
starvation congestion collapse and lots

2813
02:02:18,179 --> 02:02:19,679
of other horrible things which would

2814
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,540
result out of work

2815
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:24,420
but we I also have to react to incipient

2816
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:26,699
congestion by adjusting the rate of

2817
02:02:26,699 --> 02:02:29,159
particular flaws to nicely play with one

2818
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:31,260
another and I think these exist at

2819
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:34,020
different levels of importance and we've

2820
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:35,699
kind of recognized that over the years

2821
02:02:35,699 --> 02:02:38,040
but it's not really reflecting the RFC

2822
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,560
series to the same extent so I've tried

2823
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,540
to group the recommendations on these

2824
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:46,460
two topics separately next slide

2825
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:49,739
um yeah I rewrote um I changed a lot and

2826
02:02:49,739 --> 02:02:51,840
it's like

2827
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,520
um there's a table of contents just to

2828
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,900
encourage you it's not actually as long

2829
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:57,420
as it looks because some of this is um

2830
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:59,639
motherhood and apple pie and some of it

2831
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:01,860
is the new stuff well the new stuff just

2832
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:04,139
grouping the old stuff so actually it's

2833
02:03:04,139 --> 02:03:06,719
an easy read so please read it next

2834
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:07,860
slide

2835
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:11,820
and is anyone willing to play with me on

2836
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:14,639
trying to get this right and that's the

2837
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:16,440
reason for standing here

2838
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:18,780
um I've had one or two offers at this

2839
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:20,099
meeting of people who've worked in

2840
02:03:20,099 --> 02:03:22,380
congestion control previously and would

2841
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:24,179
be really great people to have on my

2842
02:03:24,179 --> 02:03:26,340
side to try and get this right if you're

2843
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:28,380
willing to join me please do if you've

2844
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:30,179
got different opinions to me even better

2845
02:03:30,179 --> 02:03:32,280
I don't mind I don't mind what the

2846
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,900
recommendation is I just mind that we

2847
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:36,599
get a new one that is appropriate or we

2848
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:38,040
established that the current ones are

2849
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,199
quite right so anyone will help me

2850
02:03:40,199 --> 02:03:42,239
please come and speak to me after this

2851
02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:44,419
meeting

2852
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:46,879
foreign

2853
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:52,679
very quick pitch from Martin if you want

2854
02:03:52,679 --> 02:03:54,360
to do it do you want to talk or do you

2855
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,500
want to just assure the slide

2856
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:00,659
so Martin's talking as an individual and

2857
02:04:00,659 --> 02:04:02,760
this is on the ecn story go ahead Martin

2858
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:04,500
yeah all right I'm not going to go all

2859
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,060
the way through this but um there's a

2860
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:08,040
bunch of ecn drafts out there

2861
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,619
um uh I don't think they cover all the

2862
02:04:10,619 --> 02:04:13,320
cases specifically I did a review of a

2863
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:15,540
ipsec draft that like matches a bunch of

2864
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:16,920
packets together

2865
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,900
uh if you match together different ecn

2866
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:20,699
markings given that CE is now sort of

2867
02:04:20,699 --> 02:04:24,420
ambiguous uh there's trouble next slide

2868
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:26,340
and so after a lot of thinking and a lot

2869
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:27,480
of assumptions which are probably wrong

2870
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,920
and ought to be challenged like I came

2871
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,360
up with this big truth table please take

2872
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,280
a look uh if there's something we want

2873
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:34,619
to do we can do it if we want to somehow

2874
02:04:34,619 --> 02:04:36,480
Munch documents together it's getting

2875
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,300
late in the day but we could do that too

2876
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,639
um let me know thanks

2877
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:44,880
so uh David black speaking individual I

2878
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,800
took a look at I took a look at this and

2879
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,719
the existing drafts this is a standalone

2880
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:51,300
piece of work uh Mark we would Martin's

2881
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,699
take that it's not covered in 60 40. it

2882
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:55,440
looks like it would be a useful update

2883
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,480
and as individualized support just just

2884
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:59,219
taking this forward and doing this as an

2885
02:04:59,219 --> 02:05:01,380
add-on to 60 40.

2886
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:03,560
foreign

2887
02:05:09,139 --> 02:05:13,260
people here the meeting's not over uh

2888
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:15,060
we're carrying on the IHF meeting for a

2889
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:16,380
while so please continue to talk about

2890
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,179
transport things this particular

2891
02:05:18,179 --> 02:05:20,580
session's finished uh thank you for

2892
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:23,699
attending see you online or in person if

2893
02:05:23,699 --> 02:05:25,199

02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:28,280
thank you everybody

2895
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:38,520
things listed so I don't know if you

2896
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,020
didn't realize that when you requested

2897
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:42,440
your sessions

2898
02:05:44,179 --> 02:05:46,639
we should ask but there's the evidence

2899
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:49,679
yeah so um yes that's fine so next time

2900
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:52,619
uh answer two because um there's another

2901
02:05:52,619 --> 02:05:55,699
hour material we can get
