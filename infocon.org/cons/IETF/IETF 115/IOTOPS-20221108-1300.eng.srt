1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,700

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,960
all right thank you

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,980
at least I imagine that

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,580
oh excellent

5
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,340
and there's a quick hello and then you

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,100
do the in between stuff

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,939
yeah okay

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,160
okay

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,100
so welcome everybody

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,040
um this is the ietfs 115 London hybrid

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,559
meeting iot operation working group

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,620
session welcome in the room welcome all

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,120
over the world in all the time zones

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,300
good morning good afternoon good evening

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,039
and uh first of all this session has

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,360
been recorded

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,780
that's uh part of the rules so if you're

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,039
not familiar with the rules there's

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,080
something called the note Bell most of

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,240
you are probably very aware of that I

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,220
want to highlight that a few

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,680
uh are you being recorded here say

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,220
something that's IP related so um maybe

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,320
read the code of conduct and copyright

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,619
BCPS listed here also we have a uh

26
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,439
pretty easy rule that uh that we are

27
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,439
only uh talking to people in a way uh

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,360
like that we bought we've talked at so

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,119
be nice to each other and um going from

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,020
there

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,640
there's a agenda Tool uh agenda page at

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
the data tracker if you are in the room

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,880
we also must virtually raise your hand

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,040
that is for the fairness for the remote

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,900
attendees so remote attendees and

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,360
on-site attendees have the same way to

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,159
queue for a mic so um the lower Arrow

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,280
points to the tool at the uh

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,979
um agenda site where you can click for

40
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,439
the on-site tool and that's basically a

41
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,939
rest hand and item and a chat icon

42
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,680
so going from here

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,160
we have a agenda that is apparently

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,379
already on the side we will talk about

45
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,020
that in a few minutes if you find some

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,520
issues I think that the most important

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,280
thing here as a resource uh

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,300
um record them you find a new recorder

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,200
bug

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,900
bug item at the data tracker basically

51
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,060
everywhere since a few weeks so if you

52
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,260
find something that's not working out

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,800
for you uh please uh issue that and now

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,220
coming to the actual iotops session uh

55
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,879
my culture Alexei and me I'm Hank I will

56
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,580
lead to this uh we already have uh two

57
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,620
volunteers for chat scribes so we can

58
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,620
skip that item the minutes are at the

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,660
echo so you're probably aware of those

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,180
and we have a relatively full agenda for

61
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,500
today

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,099
um

63
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,680
starting with the biggest item off and

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,080
that is I think interesting for

65
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,959
everybody to follow I assume an ID that

66
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,239
we could maybe adopt

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,420
yes sorry are we going to there was some

68
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,459
agenda bashing request

69
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,640
so uh Elliot asked to be first because

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,980
he has to be in another meeting

71
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,860
so if there are no objections we'll let

72
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,560
Elliot

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,140
so device schema extension for skim will

74
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,700
be first and then we'll continue with

75
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,519
the rest of the agenda

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,519
things that looks almost

77
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,340
just said that two minutes ago so my

78
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,760
goldfish brain probably missed that

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,099
going going with the discussion of um

80
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,099
draft Brandon will show us uh we have

81
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm not going to read to you the whole

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,319
agenda we have a full agenda there was

83
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,440
once upon a time uh the opportunity for

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,360
any other business that's only available

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,280
if someone uh is faster than expected

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,860
um going from here I think we can start

87
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,040
sharing Elliott's content so let me

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,319
quickly go to

89
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,280
the reshare

90
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,280
yeah I assume I have to do this right

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,899
yes x marks the spot

92
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,260
right can you hear me

93
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,240
Tim got it

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,759
there it is all right so um I'm gonna

95
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,840
try and give you back a little bit of

96
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
time

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,740
right so this is about skim for devices

98
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,680
system for cross I cross domain identity

99
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
management for devices this is work on

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,960
behalf of myself Muhammad shahzad and

101
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,280
Hassan iqbar uh who uh the the former

102
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,259
two are at the North Carolina State

103
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,840
University next slide please

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,720
oh yeah that's me sorry

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,340
all right so

106
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,900
um as this group knows more than

107
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,259
everybody else there are a zillion ways

108
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,259
to do on device onboarding

109
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,280
um and so uh we asked a question from an

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,080
administrator's standpoint right in fact

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,360
we asked four or five questions from an

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,340
administrative standpoint number one is

113
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,940
how do I provision a new device into new

114
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,759
infrastructure number two is how to

115
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,919
establish the bootstrapping credentials

116
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
for that device for a particular

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,080
mechanism right so if you have different

118
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,699
devices using different mechanisms how

119
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,900
do you know which one

120
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,020
third is what sort of ancillary

121
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,820
information would I like to provision as

122
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,860
well where that information comes from

123
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,539
I'll tell you in a moment

124
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,020
and four is how do I get application API

125
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,740
information for non-ip based uh

126
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,080
infrastructure that is to say

127
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,600
if you have a ble or a zigbee or some

128
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,259
other

129
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,020
non-ip device and you want to Tunnel

130
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,080
requests to from them what are the API

131
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,780
endpoints for that so these are sort of

132
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,460
the sort of information that you might

133
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,560
want when you're provisioning advice

134
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,500
well the question is and let's start

135
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,320
with who the I is the I could be a

136
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,660
partner of an Enterprise or deployment

137
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,240
saying here I've sold you something the

138
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,340
the I could be an individual who's

139
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,400
making use of this through an app and a

140
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,039
standardized protocol to transmit the

141
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,020
information

142
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,280
there could be several different values

143
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,680
of I here

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,319
but one nice value of this is if we can

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,759
all communicate the same way no matter

146
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,440
who the I is that's what a protocol is

147
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,460
good for

148
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,740
next slide please

149
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,380
so how can we do this

150
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,360
turns out if we want to bring all this

151
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,100
stuff together where we have no

152
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,259
technology religion and as this group

153
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,880
knows there's not going to be a king of

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,699
the Mountain uh for for onboarding nor

155
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,199
King of the mountain for transport

156
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,880
Technologies nor King of the mountain

157
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,759
for any other thing in iot right the

158
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,740
only thing I want to know is what is

159
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,199
what is being provisioned and and how do

160
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,280
I communicate with it so skim a system

161
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,100
for uh cross domain identity management

162
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,100
does this for users today it's an ietf

163
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,020
protocol

164
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,880
um it allows for normalized set of

165
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,880
schemas no technology religion that is

166
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,900
to say

167
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,960
don't care what the mechanism is as long

168
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,180
as it can be specified in a schema

169
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,620
right

170
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,780
um we provide in our draft we provide a

171
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,539
couple of initial examples we did so for

172
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,360
DPP we did so for ble we've done so for

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,180
zigbee I hope to do so soon for matter I

174
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,479
hope to do so soon uh for RFC 8366

175
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,900
vouchers maybe even anima with a little

176
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,759
bit of help from Michael in fact we

177
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,520
could probably get that done

178
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,780
um I'm looking for others in other words

179
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,940
the table Stakes is I have to have

180
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,060
sufficient information to know how the

181
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,979
deployment should be communicating in

182
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,440
order to onboard with the device so this

183
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,539
allows for if you will unified interface

184
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,580
just say what's getting plugged in and

185
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,900
how to take the next step with that

186
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,979
thing

187
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,919
Next Step next slide please so why not

188
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,120
use other stuff there are a couple of

189
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,199
other things out there we could have

190
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,080
used I'll go uh from down from the

191
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,639
bottom to top here there are only two

192
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,319
choices that I I selected you might have

193
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,419
others SNMP

194
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,759
simply no

195
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,879
right because we're done with SNMP

196
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,400
um Yang netconf and rest comp seem more

197
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,280
like a possibility but what we're really

198
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,979
what we're passing on is provisioning

199
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,139
information about devices we're not

200
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,940
passing on configuration it can

201
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,399
configuration information for those

202
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,500
devices right this is how you speak to

203
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,779
those devices how you establish trust

204
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,479
for those devices and maybe a little bit

205
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
more about what the device is who's

206
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,500
provided it a little bit of meta

207
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,480
information maybe even such stuff like

208
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,980
software bills and materials could be

209
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,420
passed as part of the provisioning step

210
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,339
or a pointer to software bills and

211
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,500
materials and similar for like where do

212
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,060
I find vulnerability information about

213
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,160
this thing there could be other meta

214
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,959
information that we want to provide

215
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,019
and that's not what netconf and

216
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,480
um Yang offer or rest conf offers

217
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,899
there's no benefit in terms of existing

218
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,560
uh schema that help for that purpose so

219
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,260
this is a useful way to to Simply

220
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,100
provide very specific provisioning

221
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,019
information the same way you would do

222
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,240
for a user when a user is being

223
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,459
provisioned onto a service like WebEx or

224
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,060
Salesforce or who knows whatever that

225
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,700
skin is used for today so this was our

226
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,779
our view for this next slide please

227
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,360
right we have some basic elements that

228
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,260
are are present in in any skim schema ID

229
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,420
meta

230
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,040
um and schemas these are all from the

231
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,339
skim core schema which provide for uh

232
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,580
things like last updated and such

233
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,200
um we have a few other things like admin

234
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
State connectivity which is the type of

235
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,180
connectivity the device has an optional

236
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,820
display name and an optional mod URL and

237
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,680
it's optional meaning you really don't

238
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,860
have to do it if you don't want to do it

239
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,019
um next slide please

240
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,120
so there are some things to think about

241
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,839
um uh Phil Hunt is is sort of Dr skim in

242
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,940
the way that I'm Dr Mudd and and Michael

243
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,519
is Dr anima for instance

244
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,920
um and Karsten is Dr core

245
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,200
um as another example

246
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
um

247
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,899
Phil gave us a couple of bits of

248
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,100
feedback

249
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,720
um one of the things we we want to make

250
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,760
sure we're doing is skim created their

251
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,459
own schema description language and I

252
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,200
sort of want to move away from that and

253
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,940
push the and push towards either

254
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,600
adjacent schema or an open API approach

255
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,220
something that is programmatically

256
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,079
validated

257
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,360
um and then we want to make sure we get

258
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,760
the normalization right we know we made

259
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,140
a couple of Goofs in the schema

260
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,200
initially in fact I'm sure we made many

261
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,480
um the authors and I don't claim to be

262
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,519
skim experts

263
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,740
um so we're going to rely on the skin

264
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,420
working group to help us on that in

265
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,760
terms of getting this stuff right next

266
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
slide please

267
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,839
right so um we're hoping to discuss this

268
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,240
on the skim working group

269
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,820
um the the adoption is not for the iot

270
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,680
Ops group rather for skim

271
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,940
um we need authors

272
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,220
co-authors reviewers

273
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,320
implementers

274
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,040
um

275
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,200
and deployments we want to try all this

276
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
out we're not tearing Harry to to push

277
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,040
this through the standardization process

278
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,500
though what we found in the skin working

279
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,899
group is that others are so there's

280
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,160
there's a lot of interest in doing

281
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,440
something along these lines another use

282
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,940
of skim that people are thinking about

283
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,640
is workload provisioning which is not

284
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,440
something I'm interested but we could

285
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
there are common aspects to what we're

286
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,980
doing so we're going to look at that in

287
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,899
the same light and see see what

288
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,820
commonality there is there's a GitHub

289
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,620
tracker I would love for people to open

290
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,200
issues and with that

291
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,060
I'll pause for any questions you might

292
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,180
have

293
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,200
you want your last slide

294
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,760
oh yeah last slide there's the last

295
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,800
slide yeah okay look at that side

296
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,579
hi Brenda hi uh Brendan Moran at the mic

297
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,980
um I guess the question I have I I don't

298
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,899
know anything about skim how is it

299
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,160
authenticated

300
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,100
uh skim that's a good question

301
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,800
um so skim is a restful protocol

302
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
um so you have to authenticate uh each

303
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,579
of the endpoints right the the one

304
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,079
endpoint you'll authenticate you know

305
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,160
that the server you'll typically

306
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,139
authenticate with uh you know your

307
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,940
typical website

308
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,459
um for client-side authentication I

309
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,899
think you have your choice you can do

310
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,959
whatever HTTP allows you to do in that

311
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,519
regard you can use a user-based

312
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,019
authentication for users who are doing

313
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,720
authentication or you can use a cert

314
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,820
based authentication or a token based

315
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,560
authentication if you want to do

316
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,660
something say with a federation where

317
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,459
partners are onboarding things for other

318
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,920
partners so essentially it's transport

319
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,139
based authentication not authenticated

320
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,079
documents right if you think that the

321
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,760
latter is important we should talk about

322
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,220
that in the skin working group uh I

323
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,339
think we should talk about that okay

324
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,040
hi Michael

325
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,660
Richardson so

326
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,079
um following from Brendan's question

327
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,040
um

328
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,320
the thing The Entity that has the

329
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,519
credential is I guess the manufacturer

330
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,120
and uh the the place that it needs to be

331
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
provisioned to is the new owner

332
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,260
um could be a manufacturer could be a

333
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,600
reseller could be a lot of people

334
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,180
depending on the model involved but at

335
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,920
some point it has to be the uh the owner

336
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,480
the owner gets could be there could be

337
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
there could be a a chain of custody yes

338
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,579
yep okay

339
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:00,540
um

340
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,439
so

341
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,320
um

342
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,079
typically I log into Amazon

343
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,399
they don't log into me

344
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,320
right for as an individual that is

345
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,760
absolutely true

346
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,980
um well

347
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,360
um I've actually bought equipment from

348
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,519
Cisco directly

349
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,980
and I typically have logged into Cisco

350
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,100
and Cisco has not logged in to me

351
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,019
we have no con we have no relationship

352
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,899
that way so to me that's a entirely

353
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,480
brand new supply chain relationship

354
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,639
where the relationship goes the other

355
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,019
way around

356
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,760
so

357
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
um

358
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
I'm I think that's the huge challenge

359
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,860
for this

360
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,920
okay I think it's far far different a

361
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,980
case for skim where

362
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,139
um me as

363
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,800
functionary in HR logs into Salesforce

364
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,680
and Provisions an account for Elliott

365
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,620
right because I'm going to my service

366
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,420
provider and providing an account for

367
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,060
for you and the relationship is that way

368
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,820
and that makes sense to me

369
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,380
so

370
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,019
um I think that there's there are issues

371
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,680
that are much much bigger than I then

372
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,240
well I don't know what the skin working

373
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,820
group wants to do with that but I think

374
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,680
that's a huge issue

375
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,480
and

376
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,920
um

377
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,660
I suspect it's bigger than that working

378
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,600
group and I suspect it goes towards

379
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,199
um

380
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,100
uh supply chain uh considerations

381
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,019
and I guess I would encourage you to

382
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,940
bring those issues back to this working

383
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,899
group

384
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,480
regularly

385
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,199
um and uh maybe you know there's

386
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,360
documents that originate here or there

387
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,060
uh that cross whatever but it to me just

388
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,800
seems like a big

389
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,920
very big difference okay and if we could

390
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,899
have assumed that kind of relationship

391
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,240
five or six years ago and maybe it was

392
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,160
Impractical then and it's practical now

393
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
tell them you tell me if that's true

394
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
then we wouldn't have built brewski the

395
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,800
way we did

396
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,380
right right so

397
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,779
um I'll briefly respond and then we'll

398
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,459
take it to we'll take your advice

399
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,040
actually right which is let's one of the

400
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,139
reasons I'm here is exactly for the

401
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,139
reason that you mentioned Michael so

402
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,220
um to provide a little bit of of uh

403
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,699
uh exchange of information and the iot

404
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,260
Ops group is I think here for that

405
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,420
purpose so

406
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,380
um the whether the the that relationship

407
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,300
so in answer to the first part of your

408
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,000
question you could imagine an app that

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
uses skin using a user Authentication

410
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,339
that interacts with the local

411
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,199
infrastructure how does a perfectly

412
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,959
valid way to to proceed

413
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,339
a second way is as you say there's a the

414
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,199
reverse communication that maybe people

415
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,779
normally do but it's a Federated

416
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,279
communication

417
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,679
and the question is whether the

418
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,900
Federated communication can be used for

419
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,419
bulk exchange of information

420
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,579
these are these are areas where we are

421
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,500
you know I'm I'm not doing this because

422
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm not here in a speculative way let me

423
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,260
put it that way

424
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,799
uh Eric non-mark um yeah sorry Eric and

425
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,000
I have to highlight that you didn't

426
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,980
raise your hand but that's fine

427
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,319
yeah it logged me out at a Wi-Fi so I

428
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,600
figured instead of debugging the network

429
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,880
I should stand up at the microphone but

430
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,240
or we could wait for Wi-Fi are you bad

431
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,400
go ahead like that

432
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,500
um so um

433
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,240
I was gonna say yeah I Echo someone

434
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,980
Michael's concerned right it seems like

435
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,620
the skim sort of if they're thinking

436
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,780
about users across the main type things

437
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,220
it's actually not

438
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,960
the the information flows the

439
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,160
dependencies might be in the wrong

440
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,960
direction right and I would be

441
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,820
interested in knowing the discussion

442
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,260
that you had in the working group

443
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,179
process yesterday at their meeting or

444
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,220
sort of what what was the thought

445
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,200
process there were they trying to apply

446
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,080
this stuff in in what type of domains or

447
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,940
what with what type of sure strains

448
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,820
right I can give you an example okay

449
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,880
um an example is that in the healthcare

450
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,660
space there's a lot of

451
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,000
um information Exchange in which data

452
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,360
Lakes are formed in the cloud by the

453
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,179
um by equipment providers

454
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,220
and or and they also have a Control

455
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,440
Function that is in the cloud

456
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,660
particularly for ble devices

457
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,660
so wearables that that do like pulse

458
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,580
Hawks and other things where they want

459
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,640
to keep uh they want to do control of

460
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,100
the device from a cloud-based

461
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,559
perspective so having an API into that

462
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,260
account knowing having knowing what the

463
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,480
API endpoints are and knowing on the

464
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,160
other hand which devices in the

465
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,380
Enterprises are meant to be accessed by

466
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,320
that API is an example that a medical

467
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,960
industry is very interested in as an

468
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,340
example

469
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,860
um a second example nurses stations like

470
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,299
they're sold

471
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,440
um you know they're sold or they're

472
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,740
transmitted uh to to particular

473
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,900
um hospitals or something like that and

474
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,720
those they want the practitioners just

475
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,280
to Simply Be able to plug them in they

476
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,240
don't want to have to worry about

477
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,100
scanners or things like that you know

478
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,500
where you you have to use the app

479
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,200
um as say is the model for Wi-Fi uh

480
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,539
Wi-Fi lines is Easy Connect they want to

481
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,280
be able to just communicate that at

482
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,260
Point at a time of sale and time of

483
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,460
transfer even

484
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,460
right and these are for particular for

485
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,260
critical infrastructure where you know

486
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,039
you're going to have a support

487
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,559
relationship with a vendor it's

488
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,299
something that you can add some

489
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,919
infrastructure to support to make it

490
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,000
easy on the iot operator in this regard

491
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,740
that's all right I'm having hard times

492
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,440
at a map and I have to play time cop

493
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,260
here because that literally is I think

494
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,360
what what we need to do to sort of

495
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,980
figure out who are the principles and

496
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,600
sort of what are the relationships from

497
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,160
a security perspective in this to see

498
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,320
that's how different is it that what

499
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,940
we've been talking about for iot right

500
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,120
so industry okay thanks and thanks for

501
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,679
your time and your accommodation and

502
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,179
appreciate the work in groups comments

503
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,860
yeah if I was scheduled when somebody

504
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,500
was packed I would have definitely but

505
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,860
join skim contribute sounds awesome and

506
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,240
we'll we'll keep you updated here yeah

507
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,660
thank you

508
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,280
so next in line

509
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,799
which I mean is agenda

510
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,600
sequence there's no Brandon

511
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,940
hello

512
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,700
um so I'm here to give you an update on

513
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,460
uh the draft that I've been working on

514
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,400
it started essentially as a next slide

515
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,520
please it started as a summary of the uh

516
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,700
the things that are going on in the ietf

517
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,240
that are in and around uh security and

518
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,020
iot and trying to make iot systems very

519
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,340
secure

520
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,179
um

521
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,179
it's been Rewritten twice now uh the

522
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:07,580
latest change

523
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,280
Maps it more to trying to reuse a lot of

524
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,600
the other work that's been done in the

525
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,240
industry around setting up Baseline

526
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,120
security requirements so uh next slide

527
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,620
please

528
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,260
foreign

529
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,039
there it is

530
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,780
um the first question is is who's going

531
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,860
to read this

532
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,500
um obviously I'm not intending to set

533
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
normative requirements here so the

534
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,179
interesting question is who's going to

535
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,480
read a non-normative uh draft uh there's

536
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,820
a few options people who may want to

537
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,620
know what should be in their networks

538
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,299
and what technologies they should be

539
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,299
using so I think there's a a useful

540
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,280
space for us to have a landing pad for

541
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,840
that kind of information

542
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,140
next slide please

543
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,080
uh there are a lot of Baseline security

544
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,880
requirements uh documents out there and

545
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,640
there's quite quite a few I've got three

546
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,520
of them listed here uh but what what's

547
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,580
not in them in general is a mapping to

548
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,100
technologies that are actually available

549
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,200
um in fact the United Nisa one is is

550
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,120
quite interesting when it was written

551
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,400
the security to implement or the the

552
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,020
security technology to implement some of

553
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,940
its requirements didn't exist yet

554
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,520
um and it was Baseline so that's you

555
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,260
know we we're working on it and there

556
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,600
aren't necessarily mappings uh for

557
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,840
everything so I think having a draft

558
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,880
that actually describes those mappings

559
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,740
would be quite useful for implementers

560
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,880
next slide please

561
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,500
um so what we are where we are today uh

562
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,600
I think that all three of those drafts

563
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,360
need to be mapped because people come to

564
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,840
uh come to the ITF for ITF protocols and

565
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,940
Technologies from different places and

566
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,460
they may have different uh security

567
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,380
requirements that they need to map from

568
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,659
so I think that we should try and do our

569
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,720
best to map from a variety of them maybe

570
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,480
not all but at least several I think

571
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,240
that nist and Denisa together is a good

572
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,600
Baseline I've only done Anisa today next

573
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,640
slide please

574
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,799
there are uh so to go to go through how

575
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
it's divided today there are three

576
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
different categories of the of

577
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,460
requirements that are mapped uh the

578
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,140
first one is procedural those

579
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,880
requirements we can't really do much

580
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,740
about we're not that kind of Standards

581
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,500
organization and the next is our

582
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,240
architectural now some of the

583
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,580
architectures are covered by ietf

584
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,100
architecture drafts uh but not all of

585
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,559
them and some of them relate to how you

586
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,059
build Hardware the some of the

587
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,380
architectural requirements so that that

588
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,780
obviously is not our domain and again

589
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,260
those are are flagged but not mapped uh

590
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,120
next slide oh um and then of course

591
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,260
they're the important ones the

592
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,700
technological requirements which is what

593
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,179
we care about next slide please

594
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,340
um and getting ahead of myself uh right

595
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,799
so there's a bunch of of categories that

596
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,020
uh that are described and and I've I've

597
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,340
broken them down

598
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,020
um it's not that interesting to talk

599
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,240
through them at this stage I think the

600
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,620
more interesting thing if you want to

601
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,179
understand what's going on there is to

602
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,980
go and look at the draft but broadly

603
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,120
speaking

604
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,100
um each of these has a mapping into

605
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,260
something that we do we've got cozy

606
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,700
we've got uh TLS and and oscore and dtls

607
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,340
and Matt I don't and uh quick I don't

608
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,440
think Quick's in there

609
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,600
um there's you know software isolation

610
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,280
is another interesting one that's where

611
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,280
teap comes in I'm cryptography of course

612
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,780
links back to Cozy again you know

613
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,179
there's it's divided down in these kinds

614
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,299
of ways and each one of these has a call

615
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,900
out to a specific uh ietf technology

616
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,179
next slide please

617
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,059
so right now again as I said before I

618
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,280
only have any requirements mapped I

619
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,260
would very much appreciate help from

620
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,559
other uh from other contributors in

621
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,000
looking at some of the other Baseline

622
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,919
requirements documents and trying to

623
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,380
sort of merge some of these requirements

624
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,960
into similar categories so that we can

625
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,539
group together the kinds of things that

626
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,580
are important in different places and

627
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,400
whether we have any gaps that are are

628
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,700
present in the existing Suite of ietf

629
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,559
Technologies

630
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,419
um next slide please

631
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,240
or is that it

632
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,520
but oh yeah oh there I already said that

633
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,240
um

634
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,340
so if you if you're interested in this

635
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,740
work I would very much appreciate your

636
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,559
input and I I think that there's uh

637
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,020
there's something that that there is a

638
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,500
gap today in in the ietf where

639
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,860
um you know if I if I came here in and I

640
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,539
didn't know anything about what we were

641
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,960
doing I would not know where to look for

642
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,200
the the information I need to build a

643
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,419
secure iot solution and I think there's

644
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,000
a big gap when it comes to things like

645
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,279
um information security officers trying

646
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,860
to understand whether they have actually

647
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,440
followed all of the best practices and

648
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,820
whether they're missing any Technologies

649
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,100
to do that

650
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,320
um so I've run through that very quickly

651
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,658
uh are there any questions

652
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,760
oh yes we have a question yeah

653
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,140
Jasper you're in the queue

654
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,159
hi there um I'm Jasper Panzer um hi this

655
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,500
is my first ITF so nice to be here and

656
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,240
thank you very much for the presentation

657
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,779
so I actually am the uh or was the

658
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,600
evaporator of what you uh had on the

659
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
screen as the Etsy Baseline security

660
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,220
requirements for Consumer iot this is

661
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,779
also the this is called the European

662
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,360
Standard en 303645

663
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,700
so you say there is a gap here in terms

664
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,620
of helping by the communities understand

665
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,360
what is required and how to implement

666
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,799
those requirements and could you please

667
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,900
move a little bit better to the mic I'll

668
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,820
sure I have to remind you that um

669
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,320
everybody but the presenter is

670
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,260
supposedly to wear a mask I know it's

671
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,600
it's difficult but eat the mic with a

672
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,580
mask I think that's our compromise here

673
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,120
my apologies yeah so um you mentioned

674
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,380
there's a gap

675
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,299
um to help the wider communities

676
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,860
understand what their requirements are

677
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,500
and how to implement those requirements

678
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,279
in real life on the consumer iot set I

679
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,539
think they've got this fairly well

680
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,640
covered um by by Etsy so the

681
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,080
en33605 sets out the requirements both

682
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,940
on the technical side but also on the

683
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,039
organizational side and then there are

684
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,260
two companion documents which I have not

685
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,419
seen referenced in the document that was

686
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,059
shared for this presentation one of

687
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,500
those companion documents is uh

688
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,299
ts103701 which is an assessment

689
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,720
specification that helps

690
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,820
assess

691
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,159
a device against the requirements are

692
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,799
set out in the en standard and the

693
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,539
second guide the second document that's

694
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,059
only been published this year in

695
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,419
September is an implementation guide and

696
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,940
that's 40 pages long with with

697
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,179
implementation examples for each of the

698
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,000
security requirements set out in the

699
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,240
main en 203605 standard so there's a

700
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,500
whole there is already a sort of

701
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,080
document with an Etsy that does a lot of

702
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,720
what you what you expected to focused on

703
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,140
the consumer

704
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,500
connect device domain thank you

705
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,240
thanks for those comments I'll have to

706
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,700
look into that yeah and but before you

707
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,020
leave the mic

708
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,240
um this last slide that is presented

709
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,080
here

710
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,580
um on the screen is there on purpose

711
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,919
would you have the time this one yeah

712
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,980
would you be uh able to contribute and

713
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,919
identifying these uh additional um I

714
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,559
want to say Parts uh to help Brendan

715
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,840
with this book yes of course I'd be

716
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,659
happy to pawn point you to the in the

717
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,600
right direction and um and uh link you

718
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,740
to the relevant documents and make

719
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,600
introductions to to the key offices

720
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,100
needed in just for a sake of

721
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,659
completeness the implementing guide I

722
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,500
references TR

723
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,539
103621 and that's all freely accessible

724
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,460
without any payroll

725
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,020
thank you

726
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,659
so I I very much appreciate the comments

727
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:16,980
and it's great to hear that there's

728
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,200
actually implementer guides appearing uh

729
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,299
but notwithstanding that I I suspect

730
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,460
that that will not be true of all of the

731
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,200
uh Baseline security requirements

732
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,620
documents that are extant today and uh

733
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,059
people wishing to follow those other

734
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,139
guides may need some help

735
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,340
so if they're uh there are no no more

736
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,520
questions about this there's a chess

737
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,340
question we would like to raise because

738
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,799
um this document evolved like you said

739
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,059
that twice significantly and from a

740
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,919
chess point of view

741
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,779
um we would be willing to uh uh

742
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,580
take into account that we adopt this

743
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,440
document okay

744
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,559
um would you be interested in having a

745
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,200
um in room assessment call about that

746
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,399
sure

747
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,399
so um because I try to phrase something

748
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,799
I'm not entirely sure if that is

749
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,559
reflecting what you would write so I

750
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,659
would read it out before doing the call

751
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,179
that typically uh

752
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,279
avoids a lot of problems so please raise

753
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,740
your hand if you think this work is the

754
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,200
basis for a call iot Ops document to map

755
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,240
various stakeholder requirements in one

756
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,580
digestible place

757
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,500
does that sound fine with you yeah it

758
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,179
sounds fine to me or are they comments

759
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,799
on this call

760
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,380
if they're not comments then I will

761
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,779
yeah I just did that already so I'm just

762
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,480
reading out what I'd already typed in

763
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,600
yeah

764
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,100
not physically because I can't count

765
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,440
more than three people so

766
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,320
one too many yeah I've won two more many

767
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,678
actually

768
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,700
yeah the internet is awful we are trying

769
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,299
to make it better

770
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,960
shh

771
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,299
so this is an in-room assessment we will

772
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,539
of course uh repeat that ask on the iot

773
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,340
Ops list

774
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,559
um so everybody who is um having an

775
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,419
opinion here

776
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,679
um will we have to

777
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,000
we we can ask the three people here yeah

778
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,520
if they're willing to comment but I'm

779
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,779
giving this five more seconds

780
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,980
and as again I don't know how to count

781
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,840
seconds

782
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,399
um

783
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,500
at the back so

784
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,659
it doesn't show so I will read it out

785
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,700
loud so the raised hands in total were

786
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,860
36 and we have 33 and in favor in three

787
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,419
Nays uh anybody who has an a opinion

788
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,539
wants to highlight why that doesn't seem

789
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:12,000
to be a good idea

790
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,220
and there's no pressure on this if you

791
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,480
want to be silent that's fine

792
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,559
which will I take as uh

793
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,140
um being silent is fine okay but there's

794
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,840
Emmanuel in the in the The Cure just C

795
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,059
so Emmanuel you can speak up

796
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
hi Brandon and thanks a lot for this uh

797
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,220
this effort um which I think is very

798
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,899
very useful

799
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,600
um and maybe I missed it but uh you

800
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,419
talked about potential gaps and so I

801
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,279
understand that that there's uh you

802
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,220
haven't uh um assessed all of these uh

803
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,640
guidelines but for the guideline you've

804
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,559
assessed uh the most which is Anissa I

805
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,840
guess then um what would you say is the

806
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,600
the the the biggest mismatch that you uh

807
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,140
have noticed so far or that you expect

808
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,340
so I'm I'm winging this a little bit but

809
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,380
I didn't see a lot in the way of

810
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,419
onboarding guidance

811
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,480
and I think that may be a a bit of a gap

812
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,580
there

813
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,200
um I I don't think there's much like

814
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,260
there's pretty good coverage overall but

815
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,480
I think that might be a missing link

816
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,820
okay so I guess the mismatch could be in

817
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,440
both ways right like it could be like

818
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,419
that they mandate something that oh

819
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,779
sorry we don't cover or it's it's great

820
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,840
that this there is uh I mean what I

821
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,539
meant was that I think there might be a

822
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:46,140
a missing guidance or surrounding

823
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,299
onboarding

824
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,279
um I again I'm winging that slightly so

825
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,960
if someone who's more familiar with that

826
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,640
document wants to to tell me I'm wrong

827
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,179
please do

828
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,779
which sounds to me like a semi-reliable

829
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:07,519
um commitment to contribution yeah

830
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,020
any further questions

831
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,460
so if that's not the case we will

832
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,399
restate a former working group last uh

833
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,219
working group adoption call on the list

834
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,080
for this all right

835
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,239
um I think directly after the ITF

836
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,580
meeting and then we go from there thank

837
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,918
you friend thank you very much

838
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,339
foreign

839
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,960
check that set sometimes there's

840
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,219
something there

841
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,418
that's worth mentioning

842
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,359
I see one comment here

843
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,879
um that's on the Nay side which that's

844
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,739
why not hand was raised and there's the

845
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:55,440
scope is not entirely clear

846
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,240
so um

847
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,980
you still have a little chance to get

848
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,099
back to that sorry

849
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,680
uh uh I've run back uh

850
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,780
the scope is intended to be a mapping

851
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,880
document so this is specifically to say

852
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,119
there are requirements that are provided

853
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,240
by a bunch of Baseline requirements

854
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,859
documents and we'll take a selection of

855
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,160
those the scope that I've defined today

856
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,640
is relatively weak on which requirement

857
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,280
documents we should adopt I'm happy to

858
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,920
take input on that

859
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,040
um then it's a mapping from those

860
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,359
requirements to ietf Technologies and if

861
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,859
we see any gaps we should either provide

862
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:46,619
Baseline requirements that are missing

863
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,040
from the existing documents or we should

864
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,400
highlight to working groups

865
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,540
technologies that are missing from the

866
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,599
ITF if we discover any that's the scope

867
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,160
is that a clear scope

868
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,839
well that's the question was based on

869
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,940
the chat I'm not sure how

870
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,820
in sync yeah the reply here but I think

871
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,160
we can move the discussion to the list

872
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,359
again in the case yeah thank you yeah

873
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,820
I just didn't want to uh

874
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,579
um keep people that are contributing to

875
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,020
the chat out of the loop I think it's

876
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,280
important for the ah

877
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,960
Fantasia yeah further questions on the

878
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,480
list and still a broad scope by the way

879
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,000
it said okay but moving on so next

880
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,300
presentation is uh power of attorney

881
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,579
and I see we have two presenters coming

882
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,560
up excellent no that's not a problem at

883
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,520
all

884
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,040
you're welcome hello everyone we're

885
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,960
pleased to be here so uh

886
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:00,119
she's gone around most of the

887
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,800
presentation but I want to give you a

888
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,839
background first on power of attorney

889
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,300
that is a general tool and then we will

890
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,400
run into how to use it for onboarding

891
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,920
and we're interested to see if this fits

892
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,760
the group

893
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,280
sure and whenever you speak whoever's

894
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,079
speaking up basically always been close

895
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,000
to the mic so the remote attendees can

896
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,859
you and yeah okay next slide please

897
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,520
so power of attorney overview uh you all

898
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,079
know about power of attorneys in real

899
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,640
life that you can delegate some

900
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,160
authority to someone to to to represent

901
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,440
you at some meeting or something but

902
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,880
here we propose it uh in a digital form

903
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,040
where a principal can sign a POA and

904
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,260
give it for example to a device and

905
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,420
typically we are looking into

906
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,700
semi-autonomous devices or entities that

907
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,040
are fairly powerful and can act on your

908
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,460
behalf and also the agents then so the

909
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,619
POA is used here to authorize these

910
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,680
entities and this identities they have

911
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,599
to have an identity right so it's not

912
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,480
like super small and it is they have

913
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,880
some identity they typically have a

914
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,339
public key and a private key so that

915
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,680
they can be identified and

916
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,160
so on and they act and on behalf of the

917
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,780
resource owner that's called the

918
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,460
principal here so we have principles and

919
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,000
agents uh the POA is a self-contained

920
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,180
document this is decentralized so it can

921
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,700
include detailed credentials and also

922
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,480
expiration type next please

923
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,820
so some of the essential properties here

924
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,619
is that it's self-contained and

925
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,079
decentralized as I said so it resembles

926
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,700
like PDP that is used for authentication

927
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,980
primarily and but we use here for

928
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,040
authorization primarily

929
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,380
uh you can add some centralization into

930
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,140
this by having an optional signatory

931
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,859
registry that can store poas and and

932
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,180
sign them and

933
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,000
authorize them in another step

934
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,220
there's also separation in time between

935
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,060
signing you can sign a POA today so it

936
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,060
can be used tomorrow or next day and the

937
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,579
principle may not even be online when

938
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:16,320
the POA executed by the agent so we have

939
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,440
this this connect here and we also

940
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,740
enable my multi-level sub granting ss3

941
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,320
will explain here so I can for example

942
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,260
give you a master POA that tells you

943
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,540
that you are allowed to give smaller

944
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,420
poas to your devices in order to have

945
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,900
them enter to my domain for example

946
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,940
and then of course POA can contain

947
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,400
additional Integrity information such as

948
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,579
device hashes software hashes and so on

949
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:47,220
to ensure that the device is really the

950
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,700
same as it was when I gave it the POA

951
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,260
so this is the background and now it's

952
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,740
three piece

953
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,400
next slide please

954
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,400
thank you Lou so

955
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,220
um onboarding it it must be

956
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,619
administrative administratively scalable

957
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,980
that's the that's one of our goals so

958
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,579
the site owner must have a secure method

959
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,859
to to delegate the onboarding

960
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,260
credentials to the subcontractors and

961
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,119
the subcontractor here or the integrator

962
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,820
is the one who on the device

963
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,660
and so uh if we delegate the power

964
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,060
through our approach then the then the

965
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,240
device can onboard uh on behalf of the

966
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,740
subcontractor

967
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,740
so onboarding should not require all the

968
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,720
parties in the trust chain to be online

969
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,980
in our case and uh it also doesn't

970
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,079
necessarily involve transfer of the

971
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,300
ownership because the owner here is the

972
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,000
subcontractor and he can onboard himself

973
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,060
by using the power of attorney next

974
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,980
slide please

975
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,300
yeah so this is the basic idea of what

976
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,560
is the power of attorney based

977
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,540
authorization so we you can see in the

978
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,579
figure like there are three uh entities

979
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,980
principle agent and the resource server

980
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,020
so the principle is the is the

981
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,700
subcontractor in the use case so the

982
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,740
principal is the one who generate the

983
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,740
power of attorney POA and then send it

984
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,960
to the agent which is the iot device or

985
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,400
cyber physical system which is

986
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,760
semi-autonomous or autonomous so the

987
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,640
when the principal send this POA to the

988
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,740
to the device then the device can now on

989
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,440
work on behalf of the of the principle

990
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,820
and it's also time limited so after

991
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,700
certain time it will get expired

992
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,740
so here uh the resource server can be

993
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,140
seen as uh in the case of onboarding use

994
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,480
case we can say it's the uh Target

995
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,540
Network on boarding controller so uh

996
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,480
upon receiving the POA uh from the agent

997
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,540
the resource server now can grant uh the

998
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,760
the required uh required documents or

999
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,160
whatever data that's required that's

1000
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,760
requested in the POI to the agent so

1001
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,280
using that data the agent can work on

1002
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,099
behalf of the principle and we also have

1003
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,440
the signature registry to store the poas

1004
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,900
and some other metadata if it's needed

1005
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,260
it's an optional um entity

1006
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,900
next slide please

1007
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,119
Yep this is our approach for uh

1008
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,820
onboarding so we uh we are trying to

1009
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,680
establish a trust chain between the

1010
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,740
subcontractor and the device and the

1011
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,440
target network onboarding controller or

1012
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,960
Target Network so this can be done

1013
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,480
through transferring the POS between

1014
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,240
these three entities so we have we have

1015
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,640
two POS in the case of onboarding use

1016
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,820
case so the first one is uh from the

1017
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,060
subcontractor to the to the device so uh

1018
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,800
sorry the first one is from the

1019
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,300
onboarding controller to the

1020
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,040
subcontractor so that the uh

1021
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,220
subcontractor can now on board on behalf

1022
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,740
of the actual Target Network

1023
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,440
and another one is uh between the

1024
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,020
subcontractor and the device so that the

1025
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,420
device now can onboard on be on behalf

1026
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,920
of the subcontractor so it can onboard

1027
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,880
itself

1028
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,280
next is that um

1029
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,079
uh yeah as I mentioned before the

1030
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,240
ownership it can be kept by the

1031
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,660
subcontractor and together we it we are

1032
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,000
um trying to be more uh scalable in an

1033
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,520
administratively uh scalable and more

1034
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,599
secure

1035
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,359
and also we can even

1036
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,420
um pass the authorization credentials uh

1037
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,839
through the uh inside the POA

1038
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:33,599
yeah next slide please

1039
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,940
Yep this is the protocol flow for the

1040
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,700
POA based authorization for onboarding

1041
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,119
so we have the subcontractor device and

1042
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,040
the onboarding component and the

1043
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,720
certificate Authority for from the local

1044
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,839
Cloud so the subcontractor now of in the

1045
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,300
A and step B are the two power of

1046
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,400
attorneys as I mentioned earlier so the

1047
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,560
a is the onboarding component sending

1048
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,319
its power of attorney to the uh

1049
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,780
subcontractor the principal so that now

1050
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,140
the principal gets the

1051
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,460
credentials or it's all the rice now

1052
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,560
next after that

1053
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,020
principal now can can now generates

1054
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,440
another another POI to its trusted uh

1055
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,160
device uh now on the device now can it's

1056
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,920
a device that we need to onboard and the

1057
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,280
device now can onboard uh in C C A C A

1058
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,760
and B so it's um it's it's sending the

1059
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,200
uh POA along with the other and uh other

1060
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,140
device onboarding credentials and then

1061
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,900
indeed there is a communication between

1062
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,579
the certificate Authority and the

1063
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,260
onboarding component it's basically

1064
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,660
nothing but the public key certificates

1065
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,660
and then in F the onboarding component

1066
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,480
upon successful uh verification and

1067
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,480
validation it send back the network

1068
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,760
onboarding credentials to the device so

1069
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,160
that device can onboard yep next slide

1070
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,839
please

1071
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,380
if this we implement it as a Json web

1072
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,240
token so the when you look at the

1073
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,940
payload this these are the different

1074
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,880
um parameters so the

1075
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,520
we include the public keys and the uh

1076
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,420
resource owner ID which is the ID of the

1077
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,420
um Target Network and we also have as I

1078
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,760
mentioned like the expiration time

1079
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,380
and we also have the transferable

1080
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,300
parameter which is quite important like

1081
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,000
this is the one as ulo mentioned uh we

1082
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,300
can do multi-level authorization or the

1083
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,579
agent or the device can actually

1084
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,460
transfer the POI to another agent if the

1085
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,819
uh the X in the transferable if the in

1086
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,740
that integer is one two depends on how

1087
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,300
many levels you want

1088
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,380
next slide please

1089
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,280
yep so uh we POI can be used as a in

1090
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,260
General application uh not only for

1091
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,140
onboarding it can also be used for uh

1092
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,380
other General applications and uh uh we

1093
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,880
have we have built an open source

1094
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,980
Library so anyone can download it and

1095
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,819
use uh and also uh another future work

1096
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,160
is to build a Docker image for that and

1097
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,319
another interesting work is to integrate

1098
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,680
it with oil we have a a publication on

1099
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,060
that

1100
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,140
next slide please

1101
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,800
yeah that was the last one so yeah we we

1102
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,060
have the draft

1103
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,859
and more review comments I appreciate it

1104
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:31,040
thank you

1105
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:41,579
yeah there's a secure forming up

1106
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,520
and uh

1107
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,440
I'll give you first

1108
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,359
ah

1109
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:52,260
I don't know I might say so yeah thanks

1110
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,480
so

1111
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,140
I so you said that like the from the

1112
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,520
very beginning I got a strange feeling

1113
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,819
that I heard that terminology already so

1114
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,839
that's

1115
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,240
resource server that really similar to

1116
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,760
the auth right so and in the end you

1117
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,560
said that we need to integrate with the

1118
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,220
oos so I just don't really can you

1119
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,960
explain how that's really different from

1120
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,599
the OS and what should be the exactly

1121
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,800
with the integration but

1122
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,140
some of the properties we mentioned

1123
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,940
earlier is that it's like the time

1124
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,220
difference the POA is something that you

1125
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,680
sign off beforehand and it could be

1126
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,780
valid for a longer period of time like

1127
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,540
days or weeks depending and and it's

1128
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,720
also sent to an entity that has its own

1129
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,099
uh

1130
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,099
identity and can do the public key

1131
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,859
or a private key authentication and

1132
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:49,319
authorization and it's that we can do it

1133
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,359
in several steps also so the whole point

1134
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,160
here is to be able to

1135
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,980
get scalable onboarding by delegating it

1136
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,380
to subcontractors for example in mining

1137
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,960
industry there are lots of excavators

1138
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,180
and trucks and so on that has to go in

1139
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,880
and they want to onboard but not change

1140
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,920
ownership right so that's what we're

1141
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,780
talking about here

1142
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,260
thanks

1143
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,640
hi um I was wondering I actually have

1144
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,280
two questions and a comment uh so first

1145
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,300
the comment uh the key are the um

1146
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,859
signatory registry looks to me like it's

1147
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,680
got substantial overlap with with work

1148
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,000
in skit

1149
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,980
uh so you might want to check out the

1150
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,900
skit working group

1151
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,000
um the second the the question the first

1152
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,359
one is can you highlight for me what the

1153
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,839
overall differences are between this and

1154
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:46,700
key delegation with key utilization

1155
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,060
well I mean you

1156
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,800
can be delegation yeah you mean kind of

1157
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,380
no no not not like oauth but

1158
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,780
um like your normal

1159
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,119
um pki infrastructure this looks to me

1160
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:09,359
like a pki exercise we we know you know

1161
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,640
it looks like certificate delegation

1162
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,880
but with ex different key utilization

1163
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,960
fields

1164
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,300
yeah exactly you've got a root CA

1165
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,520
signing a search but with specific key

1166
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,780
utilization

1167
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,460
yeah but it's it's the authorization

1168
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,920
part here that it's uh the focus really

1169
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,760
if you like pki it's uh it's more on the

1170
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,760
authentication and uh delegating the

1171
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,700
full thing right so this is an API to a

1172
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,619
CA so this is an API to a CA no no okay

1173
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,119
we use uh you can use pki for the public

1174
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,800
and private keys that are used to sign

1175
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,060
and and direct these poas so the POA is

1176
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,339
directed to an agent based on the public

1177
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:56,700
key of that agent or that's part of the

1178
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,920
identity of the uh okay

1179
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,359
um I guess the final question I have is

1180
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,520
how are you handling revocation

1181
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,619
when your sub contractor does something

1182
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,020
nasty and you need to get rid of them uh

1183
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,060
replication of the POA that's like

1184
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,880
storing it uh well that's not yet in

1185
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,520
scope right revocation revocation you're

1186
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,319
having to get rid of them your

1187
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,819
subcontractor has violated their

1188
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:20,040
contract revocation is always a very

1189
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,200
hard it's a good question really hard in

1190
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,180
decentralized systems so how do you

1191
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,400
ensure that if you revoke it that it's

1192
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,880
not still uh residing somewhere

1193
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,420
um the POA repository adds some

1194
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,880
centralization to the concept and

1195
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,180
improves the possibility to revoke but

1196
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,680
that's the best answer we have right now

1197
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,540
okay thank you for the study thanks

1198
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,720
attack

1199
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,200
uh Eric so one of the things I'm trying

1200
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,819
to map out in my head

1201
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,740
um and I can't quite do it on the Flyers

1202
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,960
sort of the flows here compared to

1203
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,660
something like the the fighter device

1204
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,000
are onboarding right because it has some

1205
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,680
similar things

1206
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,780
but I think it would be very useful to

1207
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,520
sit down and sort of see okay how do

1208
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,960
these things actually relate because

1209
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,780
it's not quite it's not delegation in

1210
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,339
this sense but it is sort of this

1211
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:16,680
handoff of here I have something that

1212
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,599
was manufactured that was resold that

1213
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,280
that ends up being installed so I don't

1214
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,359
know if you guys have already looked at

1215
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,220
that stuff but if not we could sit down

1216
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,160
and try to tease this apart

1217
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,980
uh yeah we have looked into Fido and it

1218
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,720
seems that the main focus there is to

1219
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,420
through the supply supply chain and

1220
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,880
changed ownership and all the way to

1221
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,300
onboarding at this final site and as we

1222
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,040
said we're not necessarily demanding a

1223
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,200
change of ownership they're also based

1224
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,319
on the Rendezvous server yeah to handle

1225
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,960
this so uh so the ownership is the key

1226
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,760
difference in terms of okay the use case

1227
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,900
okay thank you

1228
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,099
hello eskodak I just um heard you were

1229
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,319
using Json web token I think and that

1230
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,540
kind of was ringing a bell in my mind

1231
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,280
because I've been working on the

1232
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,859
specification it's not a public one but

1233
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:10,260
one where we defined the seaboar web

1234
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,440
token so it's like the compact version

1235
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,559
of that for for a similar purpose it was

1236
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,599
not specifically onboarding but it was

1237
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,720
for a commissioning entity to manage iot

1238
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,680
devices in a commercial Network for a

1239
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,780
specific domain so the commissioner

1240
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,960
would get a token basically renting

1241
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,480
certain rights of management for limited

1242
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,140
duration so it was all encoded in the

1243
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,700
web token so in that sense

1244
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,859
that sounds similar and I think the use

1245
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,800
case might be uh you know very common

1246
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,420
let's say because it came up from

1247
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,880
industry requirements

1248
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,859
I'm not sure yet what the relation is

1249
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:52,680
with with onboarding so it seems like

1250
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,839
slightly different managing from from

1251
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,079
delegating uh the onboarding part to a

1252
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,819
subcontractor

1253
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:01,559
but yeah I won't think about that so

1254
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:03,780
just because it's a very good comment

1255
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,460
and that's part of the reason we are

1256
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,559
here also to understand from you what

1257
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,619
are the related Technologies and how we

1258
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,780
are going to differentiate or preferably

1259
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,240
complement them and build on them that's

1260
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,780
the major Target yeah or maybe we could

1261
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,579
even kind of standardize something that

1262
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,579
that I've worked on only in a private

1263
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,079
setting here maybe that's also something

1264
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,720
we can have a ITF version of those

1265
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,700
things yeah okay

1266
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,819
thank you

1267
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,359
hi Michael Richardson

1268
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,400
um so I noticed I took a quick look at

1269
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,680
your draft draft and I noticed you cite

1270
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,300
the Intel

1271
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,319
um stuff

1272
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,359
um but not the Fido stuff which is

1273
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,180
essentially an evolution of them

1274
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,460
um Intel has some interesting and

1275
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,260
potentially bogus IPR on in their stuff

1276
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,160
um

1277
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,520
uh the Fido Rendezvous server is

1278
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,579
probably non-operational

1279
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:04,260
but what you're describing to me is

1280
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,940
sounds very similar to what they're

1281
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,099
doing specifically the fact that you

1282
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:10,859
have a forward statement uh that goes

1283
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:13,079
through the supply chain as opposed to a

1284
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:15,000
request

1285
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,380
um

1286
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,660
I guess I'll I'll say you need please

1287
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,160
come and look in the animal working

1288
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,140
group um Esco here for instance is

1289
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,640
working on as you said the constrained

1290
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,079
voucher format which is uh cozy signed

1291
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,339
seabor

1292
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:32,819
um we also have Jose signed Jason as

1293
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:36,059
well as the original CMS sign Jason

1294
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:38,220
um in addition to that we have a

1295
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,220
mechanism by which uh devices can be

1296
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,440
onboarded offline

1297
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,520
offline off-boarded I don't know uh but

1298
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,740
the conception here is that a

1299
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,359
commissioner a person

1300
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,420
uh would in fact wander into in their

1301
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,400
reference thing into the basements of

1302
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,440
newly constructed homes for instance

1303
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,740
which have no internet and have no LTE

1304
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,359
because it's the basement

1305
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,400
my office is in the basement I have no

1306
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,559
LTE at my desk

1307
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:11,819
um and um would onboard the device and

1308
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:14,460
the idea is that actually we really do

1309
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,020
want to minimize round-trip times

1310
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,300
because they actually represent uh

1311
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,280
commissioner guy going up and down the

1312
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,300
stairs

1313
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,160
um with his device

1314
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,660
um so that that's that's a whole Space

1315
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,579
of things that there

1316
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,240
um and so to me it sounds like you've

1317
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,760
kind of reinvented three or four wheels

1318
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,760
here and I I I I I'm not sure that

1319
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,020
there's a reason for it to be

1320
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,119
gratuitously different so I would

1321
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,520
encourage some convergence of file

1322
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,040
formats even if you can't get all the

1323
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,859
semantics the same okay as Elliot said

1324
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:49,319
earlier there are 19 different ways of

1325
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:50,880
doing things but we don't have to have

1326
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,480
19 different uh file formats and I think

1327
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,160
that's really important

1328
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,740
um and and also there's an OPC UA

1329
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,559
mechanism and it's mostly Trust on first

1330
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:02,520
use

1331
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,740
however

1332
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,440
um they have some interest in doing

1333
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,380
something more or some of them do and so

1334
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,079
that's particularly important finally I

1335
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,880
don't really understand what

1336
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,040
what is it when you say there's no

1337
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,058
transfer of ownership

1338
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,099
what does that really mean because

1339
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,380
despite the fact that Brendan's phone is

1340
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,059
pretty sure he's it's his I'm pretty

1341
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,859
sure it belongs to Apple

1342
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,900
so what is the lack of ownership

1343
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,240
transfer mean right

1344
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,280
okay that's also a lot of things but

1345
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,839
thanks a lot for the input where we're

1346
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,520
gonna look and I hope we get the minutes

1347
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,220
so we can remember all the related

1348
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,819
Technologies uh I I try and do one by

1349
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,700
one the Intel thing I I agree that if

1350
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,579
we're into consumer market for example

1351
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:53,819
there is probably no big need for POA

1352
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:56,720
you're fine with that the original

1353
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,119
manufacturer has the centralized server

1354
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,280
to keep track of the device through the

1355
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,500
supply chain and all the way into

1356
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,420
onboarding

1357
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,819
we have gotten our requirements from

1358
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:11,579
industry we have talked to like mining

1359
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:13,680
industry for example and that's where

1360
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,540
they have the case they they don't

1361
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,300
really want to trust the original

1362
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,819
manufacturer they have uh trust chains

1363
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:24,420
between subcontractors and main site and

1364
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,520
they want to see this way of how can we

1365
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,400
onboard things in a scalable way so

1366
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,220
that's where we are it's more industrial

1367
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,240
applicability here I would say and then

1368
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,059
transfer of ownership here as I said it

1369
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:41,400
it remains with the subcontracts and

1370
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,160
they're allowed to like bring in their

1371
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,140
big equipment for some period of time

1372
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,520
that the POA will expire also so

1373
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,099
they're on boarded but still so so I

1374
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:54,540
think that I think that what you're

1375
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,640
telling me is that

1376
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,339
um when I come to visit your home

1377
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,859
you would like to allow my phone on your

1378
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:03,720
network yeah but you don't want to own

1379
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,520
my phone right and that's the same model

1380
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,099
so really

1381
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:09,740
um in some sense this is not about

1382
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,260
onboarding this is about access control

1383
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,380
to that thing and about relationships of

1384
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,180
network and I wish we could so it sounds

1385
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,579
to me like actually we have a new thing

1386
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:22,740
and that

1387
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,300
um we need a new term

1388
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,880
not on not onboarding and that that's

1389
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,520
actually I think where where your

1390
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,680
document and your conceptual of power of

1391
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,680
attorney as of that way as a mechanism

1392
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,839
is I think actually a really powerful

1393
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:40,020
conceptually right so

1394
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,140
um you know maybe maybe POA is the right

1395
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,480
term or maybe it's a some other word uh

1396
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,760
uh powering of attorney or something

1397
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,839
like that

1398
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,819
um but so so that sounds like a really

1399
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,559
cool thing that that you have some

1400
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,400
delegation but not a full transfer

1401
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,980
that's really I think a new powerful

1402
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,280
part and to me that does fit much more

1403
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,240
into the oauth notion because it's not

1404
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,299
the original manufacturer that's

1405
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,720
delegating Authority it's the owner

1406
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,960
across the horizontal now I'll let uh

1407
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,700
thank you for the comment and we are

1408
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,040
looking here to where we or if we should

1409
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,619
go with this to the ITF also which group

1410
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:25,200
should we go to with this so it's an

1411
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,920
exploration here so so so Eric again so

1412
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,500
I think philosophically right I mean you

1413
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,059
could sort of claim that well ownership

1414
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:34,920
is I'm granting you all of the access

1415
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,200
rights for this object forever

1416
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,059
and you can do whatever you want with it

1417
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:41,040
right and if you say that well then

1418
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,200
what's the difference between granting

1419
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,700
you're allowed to onboard this device

1420
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,460
onto this network for the next 24 hours

1421
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,079
well it's just different different

1422
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,880
different access rights that you're

1423
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,319
giving someone right with different time

1424
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,599
limits so philosophically I don't know

1425
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:57,480
if they're that different but so that's

1426
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,640
why you know so mapping to

1427
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,319
existing working groups might be a bit

1428
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:04,160
hard but I don't know

1429
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,640
thank you yeah and thank you so what I

1430
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,140
um can hear do you're always welcome to

1431
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,599
report back but I had two target zones

1432
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:16,339
here from the audience one of them was a

1433
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:19,200
Content relationship to Something in the

1434
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,619
the newly formed skit working group and

1435
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,720
even also echoed in the chat by

1436
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,780
participants is maybe presented oauth

1437
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,940
and and talk about that there which

1438
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,319
parts would go there for the protocol

1439
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:33,299
wise and what of the concepts for

1440
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:35,640
premature so basically in advance

1441
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,500
providing these

1442
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,099
um

1443
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:40,680
powers to other people so to speak I

1444
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,180
would be interesting for skit I assume

1445
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,339
so at least two places and we are always

1446
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:47,058
welcome back here

1447
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,980
update

1448
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,140
next time or

1449
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,700
yes thank you

1450
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,079
thank you

1451
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:58,640
and thank you thank you very much

1452
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:03,420
coming up next is I tested here I tested

1453
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,000
too yes yes I'm not so bad at this

1454
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,119
um

1455
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,740
that's harness

1456
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,319
and my my immediate code is not working

1457
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,740
very well at the moment the network is

1458
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,380
not my friend

1459
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,160
he load

1460
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:29,420
uh you mean this USBC thing

1461
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,040
yes what do you want me yeah yeah just

1462
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,540
just

1463
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:37,800
we have co-chairs so I'm not doing this

1464
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,440
[Music]

1465
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,079
yeah still I don't have a that's a good

1466
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,460
thing yet whatever no

1467
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:51,059
that's right yeah

1468
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:52,440
so

1469
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,480
who of you has attended the rats meeting

1470
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,920
yesterday

1471
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,280
a few of you okay good this is sort of a

1472
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,799
yesterday I had the very little limited

1473
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:04,380
uh time slot and so I wasn't really able

1474
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,059
to go walk you through the details so

1475
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,640
what I'm planning to do is to go through

1476
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,640
one of the scenarios and describe some

1477
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,680
of the details to give you a an idea

1478
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,780
what we are trying to do here I focus on

1479
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,500
the iot onboarding scenario although uh

1480
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,500
for us this is probably the

1481
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,720
um the confidential Computing scenario

1482
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,299
is uh what we're really after but I

1483
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:29,280
think the iot onboarding scenario just

1484
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,900
fits better and it's also described in a

1485
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,740
document

1486
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,460
okay it's actually three documents so

1487
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,260
um here's the starting point next slide

1488
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,960
uh the starting point is of all of this

1489
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,960
the device puts up and does the initial

1490
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,940
attestation which is something uh the

1491
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,920
rats group has been working on for quite

1492
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,760
a while

1493
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,700
and in our implementation

1494
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,460
if you download the trusted firmware M

1495
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,200
and a

1496
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,599
um what it does is there's a bootload

1497
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,280
that we use and you put for m-class

1498
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,680
devices it creates a hash over different

1499
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,839
firmware images

1500
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,400
um like the bootloader itself and if

1501
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,960
there are multiple stages of bootload us

1502
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,400
obviously multiple times

1503
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,740
uh the firmware images and so on and so

1504
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,780
on and then this information from the

1505
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,900
bootloader as it relinquishes control

1506
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,660
and passes it over to the firmware image

1507
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,880
or the next stage bootloader it's

1508
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,559
basically passed up

1509
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,619
um finally to the attestation service

1510
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,559
which um when this attestation service

1511
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,859
is called to provide uh the e-token it

1512
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:33,839
will do so and in the document we call

1513
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,400
this uh the platform at the station

1514
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,880
token to distinguish it from

1515
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,220
uh the other talk which we newly Define

1516
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,740
namely the key attestation token

1517
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,660
I had to give it a name uh that was the

1518
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,220
best one we came up with

1519
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,520
and this platform attestation token with

1520
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,460
the software measurements inside them as

1521
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,040
as Claims can be used to determine on

1522
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,140
whether the software running on the

1523
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,700
device actually has been tampered with

1524
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,920
which is quite important for this use

1525
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,540
case because we want to make sure that

1526
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,460
the key at the station service

1527
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,339
is actually still operating in the way

1528
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:10,920
it does uh intended in the in the

1529
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,220
document okay next slide

1530
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,260
of course in reality it's not that

1531
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,240
simple there's a whole slew of

1532
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,400
processors and and layers of software

1533
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,140
but I will

1534
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,940
glance over that next slide

1535
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:29,819
so when it comes to the stage where the

1536
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:31,680
device actually does stay uh the

1537
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,160
onboarding step it um runs a DLS client

1538
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,200
that wants to talk to the to the TLs

1539
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,720
server with uh and we've just spoken

1540
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,460
about onboarding and there are obviously

1541
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,520
different options uh available

1542
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,920
um which option you choose is immaterial

1543
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,319
to this discussion

1544
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:50,099
um

1545
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:53,880
so in the setup the iot device is the

1546
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,400
DLS client as the tester and the

1547
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,440
onboarding server is the server and so

1548
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,440
the client wants to send the evidence to

1549
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,559
the server in the terminology of the

1550
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,839
rats working group

1551
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:10,260
there's also assumes the background

1552
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,839
check model where the relying party

1553
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:15,359
talks to the verifier

1554
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,599
to get the attestation result there's uh

1555
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:21,000
or there also other models such as the

1556
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,460
passport model which is which I don't go

1557
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,500
through and it's not described yet in a

1558
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,780
document either so

1559
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,819
um we'll skip that

1560
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:31,500
next slide

1561
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,140
so here's how it starts uh since one of

1562
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,640
the documents listed on the first page

1563
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,240
is uh about the extension

1564
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,040
um the newly defined extension to the

1565
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,920
TLs handshake in if you define some new

1566
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,260
functionality in TLS you always have to

1567
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,540
do this initial negotiation in the

1568
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,280
client hello and

1569
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,680
either server Heller or in the encrypted

1570
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,260
extension and that's what uh this one

1571
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,359
and two indicates here so there's a new

1572
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:00,059
extension defined which uh it's called

1573
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,740
if for this purpose is called evidence

1574
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,540
proposal because it passes evidence

1575
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,700
around and communicates what

1576
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,079
functionality what attestation

1577
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,180
technology the client supports and the

1578
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,920
idea is that

1579
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,960
um you can support different attestation

1580
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,579
Technologies since they are just

1581
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,319
different ones so we live in the market

1582
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,460
today

1583
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,799
and to sort of Select something

1584
01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:22,799
what it also does is it needs to pass a

1585
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,440
nons uh to the client

1586
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,980
because that nuns um if you follow the

1587
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,980
rats work this nonsense included in the

1588
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,799
in whatever the evidence produced by the

1589
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,960
device to guarantee freshness of the

1590
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,819
produced data so that needs to come

1591
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:42,000
along as well and the green box shows

1592
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,859
that the nonce needs to come from

1593
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:46,500
somewhere uh namely typically from the

1594
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,539
verify either in real time or it's

1595
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:51,539
obtained earlier up front in a in a

1596
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:55,500
batch of nonsense uh that it's really an

1597
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,240
implementation detail

1598
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,940
okay so that's the initial phase next

1599
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,180
one

1600
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,200
then

1601
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,819
um

1602
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:09,539
the the TLs client needs to obtain the

1603
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,640
evidence from the attestation service

1604
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,900
and

1605
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,960
that happens in and the next slide

1606
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,599
explains the more complex structure but

1607
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,819
it requests this sort of bundle of uh

1608
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:22,200
tokens

1609
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,900
um one being the platform attestation

1610
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,579
token

1611
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,380
and the other one the key at the station

1612
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,299
token and the key at the station token

1613
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:34,079
requires that you have um bind

1614
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,260
a new um uh public private keeper to

1615
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:40,559
that token that's what the uh already

1616
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,660
the name kind of indicates that this is

1617
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,819
going to happen so at some point in time

1618
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:47,160
uh you need the TLs client needs to

1619
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,720
create

1620
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,819
um what we referred here as an identity

1621
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:53,520
key it's just a key pair uh

1622
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,559
and

1623
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:57,660
and the private key obviously needs to

1624
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,819
stay on the device and that's what the

1625
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:02,099
platform attestation token ensures that

1626
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:04,619
this uh there's no

1627
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:07,619
sort of compromise in that uh in that

1628
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:09,240
attestation service

1629
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,700
to expose that private key so it's it

1630
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:12,780
stays there

1631
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:15,480
the platform attestation functionality

1632
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,160
is unmodified because that's a small

1633
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,799
service running on the device uh

1634
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:23,759
and so the request uh in the green box

1635
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,299
essentially says give me this bundle and

1636
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:29,179
I give you the nuns that we just

1637
01:08:29,179 --> 01:08:32,219
obtained on the previous slide and pass

1638
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:34,679
in this identity key the public key part

1639
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:35,880
of it

1640
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:39,179
as input okay next slide

1641
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:41,640
so this is then the um the bundle and it

1642
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,439
consists of these two other tokens which

1643
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,719
are links linked together

1644
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:47,640
um they are linked

1645
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,600
wire the nuns uh the they're not they're

1646
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,179
obviously different ways to link them uh

1647
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,420
you could also Define uh like design it

1648
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,399
slightly differently that's but uh we

1649
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:01,020
came up with because we wanted to use

1650
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,179
our existing attestation service

1651
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:06,719
and and basically keep it unmodified

1652
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,779
and the linkage happens via

1653
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:13,920
the use of the nuns which in this case

1654
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,500
the nonce in the path is the hash of the

1655
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,620
identity key used in the cut sounds a

1656
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,960
little bit complicated that's why I

1657
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,540
created a picture

1658
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:27,660
and showed this with the errors here

1659
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,939
and the non's in the cut the key

1660
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,920
attestation token is the non-stabus

1661
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,979
provided by the TLs server and actually

1662
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:36,839
by the verifier

1663
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,339
okay next slide

1664
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,279
so somehow the client also has to send

1665
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:47,339
in this result uh to the server and it

1666
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:50,100
uses the certificate message very much

1667
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,160
in style of what the raw public erfc uh

1668
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,940
in TLS did uh the wrote that RFC allows

1669
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,980
you to

1670
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,440
um rip or convey different payloads in a

1671
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,600
certificate message not just the next

1672
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,460
five for nine certificate so that

1673
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,260
there's a registry defining a couple of

1674
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,360
different things

1675
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,400
um so that gets sent over there

1676
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,440
and next slide

1677
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,980
and and of course uh the client also

1678
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,780
needs to demonstrate possession of the

1679
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,699
private key

1680
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,739
um created this to this our related to

1681
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:25,560
this identity key uh and this is done

1682
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,920
using the certificate verify message

1683
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,219
and so that signature is

1684
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,699
um uses the I this identity key the

1685
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:38,580
private key part of it and

1686
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,920
it's a sort of regular DLS operation in

1687
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,820
some sense okay next slide

1688
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,699
and finally of course uh the server

1689
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:52,199
needs to contact the verifier to get

1690
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:55,199
to get the um attestation reside back

1691
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,060
because it

1692
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,820
as a relying party cannot really

1693
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,620
evaluate what is India that's the whole

1694
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:04,080
uh sort of point of having to verify in

1695
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,840
the first place this is um sort of like

1696
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,900
straight out of the rats architecture

1697
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,360
so this step happened and then the whole

1698
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,140
dance is if positive uh if the at the

1699
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,659
station result is positive and and the

1700
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:20,820
public key ik public key is returned

1701
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,739
obviously that was everything then was

1702
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:25,260
successful otherwise The Exchange will

1703
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,880
be aborted

1704
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,820
okay next slide I think that's actually

1705
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,040
the last yeah so what's the status of

1706
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,120
this

1707
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,080
um

1708
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,120
so I mentioned there's the confidential

1709
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,699
Computing use case which is

1710
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:40,800
um kind of mirrors uh what I just

1711
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,620
explained in the sense that the server

1712
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,659
is attested to the client rather than

1713
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:49,080
the other way around which is useful for

1714
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,659
cases where you want to upload the

1715
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:53,520
compute workload

1716
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,960
um do some confidential Computing

1717
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,060
platform and obviously want to be

1718
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,159
assured that the platform you're

1719
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:01,739
uploading your code to

1720
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:05,659
sort of has certain properties

1721
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:07,679
um we've been doing some prototyping

1722
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,179
effort and the links are on the next

1723
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,280
slide and they are supported and

1724
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,199
sponsored by the confidential Computing

1725
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,080
Consortium

1726
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,460
there's the confidential Computing

1727
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,980
Consortium sponsors several different

1728
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,940
projects and this is uh one of the more

1729
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,280
recent ones

1730
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,840
yeah in the passport model is not

1731
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,460
described in a document yet

1732
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,739
okay next slide and I think that's the

1733
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:34,099
last one

1734
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,880
so here's um obviously the documents but

1735
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,040
um maybe more interesting

1736
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,500
is the is the code if you want to try

1737
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,239
this out it's obviously very early

1738
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,760
stages uh

1739
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,219
um and the links will you know hopefully

1740
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:52,020
in the near future will be

1741
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,400
um

1742
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,840
sort of made available on the

1743
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,719
confidential Computing website

1744
01:12:57,719 --> 01:12:59,219
um sort of for easier consumption and

1745
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:01,440
integration into into some of the other

1746
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,960
uh projects there

1747
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,140
and if you would like to try it out and

1748
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,560
and need uh help or need some

1749
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,960
guidance uh let us know

1750
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,820
would be happy to to walk you through

1751
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,340
and specifically talk about some of the

1752
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,199
confidential Computing use cases with

1753
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,699
you

1754
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:23,340
that's all I had

1755
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:26,460
thanks we've already thrown the line I

1756
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,560
have to make a logistical comment that

1757
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,480
uh it's just a small reminder that

1758
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,360
everybody in the room is required to

1759
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,880
wear a mask at all times unless drinking

1760
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,480
or taking a small pause I've witnessed

1761
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,100
it is not always the case here in this

1762
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,400
room and uh well for this small reminder

1763
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,620
and go ahead

1764
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,840
Eric not Mark so so

1765
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,060
let me try to Echo back what I think you

1766
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,219
said so we're doing TLS with client

1767
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:55,260
certificates it's just that the

1768
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,699
certificates are a bit special right

1769
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:59,640
they have a bit more things in them and

1770
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,060
then but if that's the case well one

1771
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,860
thing I didn't quite understand is this

1772
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,159
identity key or Associated certificate

1773
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,380
when does that actually change is that

1774
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,320
actually a a basically a long-term

1775
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,199
identity of that that device of that

1776
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:17,820
client or is it something that changes

1777
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,980
more frequently uh very good question

1778
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,880
Eric

1779
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,500
um yeah so it's actually uh an ephemeral

1780
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,179
uh sort of an ephemeral key in that

1781
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:30,659
sense and unlike uh regular

1782
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:33,659
client-side authentication where you

1783
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:36,239
would typically have the ca the

1784
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,760
certification Authority create that for

1785
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,460
you like in an iot classical iot setup

1786
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,080
you would have that pre-provisioned up

1787
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,659
front uh maybe during the factory or

1788
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:47,360
using some other

1789
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,980
onboarding protocol or so

1790
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:54,360
um this one is is not signed by the ca

1791
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,600
um it is actually signed and if you go

1792
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,699
back a few slides to this diagram it's

1793
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:02,040
actually signed by a key that is

1794
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,380
available to the attestation service um

1795
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,880
so maybe I should have pointed this out

1796
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:10,199
this kind of makes it uh different to a

1797
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:13,020
regular certificate so

1798
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,640
um in that sense because

1799
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,080
it's it's just a different uh kind of a

1800
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,000
different model the security comes from

1801
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,219
the fact that the assumption is that the

1802
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:25,140
private key of this newly created

1803
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,960
identity key cannot be exposed and this

1804
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,500
attestation service is uh part of the

1805
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,120
trusted Computing base

1806
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,000
yes it's signed by something that is

1807
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,560
belongs to the platform or whatever

1808
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,620
underneath right right right so but so

1809
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,179
in terms of use case you describe this

1810
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:43,920
as armboarding but when you do this each

1811
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,140
time the device boots as well and then

1812
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,760
would you actually get a different

1813
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,560
identity key at that point in time

1814
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,179
because something might have changed

1815
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,530
right so

1816
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:53,159
[Music]

1817
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:53,900
um

1818
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,400
you like for the onboarding I don't

1819
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,320
think you would do onboarding every time

1820
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,780
you put uh so you would only run this

1821
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,600
protocol once and then well

1822
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,820
in in for the onboarding case you like

1823
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,739
run it as often as you do need to do

1824
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:10,980
on-boarding uh in the in the

1825
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,140
confidential Computing case

1826
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,060
um you would do it

1827
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,699
um every time you upload some new or

1828
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,679
contact the the platform and want to

1829
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,300
sort of interact with your compute

1830
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,739
platform

1831
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:25,140
um I wouldn't but I think in this case

1832
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,239
it said sort of onboarding and

1833
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:29,640
connecting to it's a management server I

1834
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,860
think those are those words right but

1835
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,420
you can connect to the management server

1836
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,100
when you reboot a week later as well

1837
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,659
yeah right so would you use the same

1838
01:16:36,659 --> 01:16:38,820
mechanism is that the idea or is it sort

1839
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,280
of like use it once and then yeah indeed

1840
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,800
if you if um which is something we

1841
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,719
didn't describe there so like if you

1842
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:48,560
talk to the um device management server

1843
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,440
it I think it would make sense to

1844
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,420
um also use the mechanism because then

1845
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:57,120
you can be reassured that uh the artist

1846
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,280
you would pass uh of course the platform

1847
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,260
at the station token along as well and

1848
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,699
so you would see if something has

1849
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:03,960
changed uh

1850
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,060
uh so that would be useful as well but

1851
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,159
we didn't talk about um sort of like the

1852
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,159
next steps uh but you're right yeah okay

1853
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,400
and the reason why we ditched this into

1854
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:17,219
the TLs exchange is simply because

1855
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:17,940
um

1856
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,219
if you want to establish you you may

1857
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,719
want to establish a secure Channel

1858
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:25,320
anyway and so tying the the attestation

1859
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,699
information with the secure Channel

1860
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:28,620
establishment

1861
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:31,500
um appear to make sense to us uh rather

1862
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,560
than sort of leaving it totally separate

1863
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,060
um

1864
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,600
David uh Dave Taylor Dave Taylor uh two

1865
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,300
comments uh so first uh you mentioned

1866
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,820
that the covers the uh background check

1867
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,280
and not yet the passport model

1868
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,900
um I think the background check is the

1869
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,179
one that's obviously relevant here

1870
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,219
um if you never do the passport model in

1871
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:54,600
your document or whatever that might be

1872
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,040
okay

1873
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,840
um background check is for onboarding

1874
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,280
the point is you're trying to get the

1875
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,040
device to test if the device is not on

1876
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,780
something then it may have no

1877
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,360
connectivity to a verifier anyway and so

1878
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,800
the only time the passport might be

1879
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,300
relevant is if you didn't care about

1880
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,920
freshness and so I'm going to say that

1881
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,020
maybe we don't care about that case so

1882
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,580
if you don't get to that I'm saying

1883
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,980
that's probably okay however my other

1884
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,199
comment is back on uh slide four you

1885
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,760
explained

1886
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,380
um that the onboarding flow that you're

1887
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,179
looking at is where and it's on this

1888
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:26,640
slide too that's what the device is the

1889
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,960
TLs client

1890
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,880
some onboarding ceremonies work that way

1891
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,500
some onboarding ceremonies is the other

1892
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,580
direction

1893
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,980
where say your onboarding server is a

1894
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,400
phone app and the device has a separate

1895
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,739
SSID that advertises and so the phone

1896
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:42,780
app connects to the thing on board's a

1897
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,060
thing and so my question is

1898
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,679
um have you looked at or maybe you

1899
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:49,380
should look at the attestation tested to

1900
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,360
OS when it's the server

1901
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,580
that's trying to attest to the client

1902
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,980
you know where the the the TLs client

1903
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,659
and server in the other direction and

1904
01:18:57,659 --> 01:18:59,040
that is just as interesting and still

1905
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,239
the background check model would apply

1906
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,760
there so I would suggest um rather than

1907
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,719
worrying about the passport model

1908
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,280
anytime soon I would rather worry about

1909
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,260
adding in the other direction too in the

1910
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:08,460
same document so

1911
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:11,159
that's that's a good find yeah I

1912
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:15,300
um the iot onboarding model I what I had

1913
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,699
in mind was um the experience with the

1914
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:19,800
fighter device onboarding um which was

1915
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,780
mentioned earlier which work exactly

1916
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,159
what is this one and it's a different

1917
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,960
set of flows I think ocf uses the

1918
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,699
opposite flow and so out of each iot

1919
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:29,040
ecosystem each one has its own variation

1920
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,360
of flows and like half of them are one

1921
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,679
half of the other one so both of them

1922
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:32,760
are interesting and your draft is my

1923
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,580
flight so thanks

1924
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:38,400
because woman a quick question uh you

1925
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,860
gave some rational for doing this in a

1926
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,980
GLS handshake no one problem here maybe

1927
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,219
that the JLS connection can go on for a

1928
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:50,280
long time in particular dtls connections

1929
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,340
tend to do that what do you do when you

1930
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,340
need more freshness during the course of

1931
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,699
this connection

1932
01:19:58,699 --> 01:20:03,960
so you specifically refer to like

1933
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,900
um the issue that if you have a DLS

1934
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,340
connection ongoing and you want to

1935
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,440
re-run this step without tearing down

1936
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,520
the connection

1937
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,699
um so there's the the both tank

1938
01:20:13,699 --> 01:20:17,219
authentication uh possibility

1939
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:19,260
um which of course we didn't describe

1940
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,540
yet

1941
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:25,199
um but that only works from the server

1942
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,000
side like the server asking the client

1943
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,900
to

1944
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,280
um do this and not the other way around

1945
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,860
so so yeah it's a good question on

1946
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,580
whether

1947
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:37,380
whether it's whether there's a need to

1948
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,679
um to basically do this saying an

1949
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:43,440
existing connection and not um dominate

1950
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,900
the existing connection which may be

1951
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,880
disruptive because you may have other

1952
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,400
things going on yeah at the same time to

1953
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,900
discover the need for more freshness

1954
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,659
yeah but I'd like to see an example for

1955
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:58,440
that yeah yeah okay uh I will probably

1956
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,020
have to talk to you about this use case

1957
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,000
yeah

1958
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,940
could uh thanks a lot thank you yeah

1959
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,960
thank you

1960
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,679
and uh Carson yeah probably close to the

1961
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:12,860
mic

1962
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,880
um we might have a if there's enough

1963
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,620
time

1964
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,420
um we could have a

1965
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,800
uh

1966
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,620
additional additional presentation

1967
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,120
but I don't know if the presenters in

1968
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,260
the room actually but Carson

1969
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,980
hi uh no for something completely

1970
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,540
different

1971
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,100
um actually not that different because

1972
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:38,820
what I'm going to talk about uh in part

1973
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:41,040
looks very similar to what we have been

1974
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,980
talking about but I want to quickly talk

1975
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,880
about the airwig working group

1976
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,920
um many of you haven't been around in

1977
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,540
2011.

1978
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,600
when this was created and

1979
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,640
the reason was that we thought we

1980
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,060
probably need some informational

1981
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,440
documents on implementing constraint

1982
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,040
node networks because the standards on

1983
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,300
themselves

1984
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,120
are maybe not enough and

1985
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,159
this working group was

1986
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,460
reasonably productive it has six rfcs

1987
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,179
out there I'm citing to hear the

1988
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:21,239
terminology I've seen that has turned

1989
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:23,580
out to be very useful

1990
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,699
um and the using TCP and iot

1991
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:30,360
RFC both are informative documents they

1992
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,800
are not setting any

1993
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,659
standards or anything but they just

1994
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:35,520
explain things

1995
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,580
and there are other rfcs on Energy

1996
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,960
Efficiency next slide

1997
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,320
so right now

1998
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:51,600
Eric has one document in auth 48. this

1999
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,580
is just a companion document to one of

2000
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,920
the earlier

2001
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,060
documents that describes how to do

2002
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,820
minimal Ike and this describes how to do

2003
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,920
minimal esps or both are just

2004
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,380
informational all these things you can

2005
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,860
leave out and you still have a valid

2006
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:09,960
ipsec implementation

2007
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,260
there is one document in isg that uh

2008
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,500
discusses curve representations

2009
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,900
how do you convert between wire stress

2010
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,780
and AdWords and Montgomery and so on

2011
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:23,400
which really doesn't belong here at all

2012
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,400
but it's also outside of the scope of

2013
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,420
what I'm

2014
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,520
uh trying to talk about and there are

2015
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,560
two active drafts

2016
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,780
one is uh

2017
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:37,140
re-spin of 7 to 28 which is what I'm

2018
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,140
interested in specifically and there's

2019
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,199
also another draft that is providing

2020
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,960
some information about uh comparing

2021
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,659
security protocols there are also some

2022
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:51,840
five expired drafts that were very

2023
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,000
useful when they were being developed in

2024
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,080
2014 or so but nobody had the time to

2025
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,500
actually complete them so they're kind

2026
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,960
of historical documents that people can

2027
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,980
go to next slide

2028
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,480
um so let's talk about those two active

2029
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,560
drafts

2030
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,460
seven two seventy two Twenty Eight

2031
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,860
um you may have run into that

2032
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:19,140
in particular if you heard about people

2033
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:22,739
targeting class one or class two uh

2034
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:26,219
devices this terminology was created in

2035
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:27,320
in that

2036
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,600
document or documented in that document

2037
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,400
and uh there is a 72 or 28 bits that

2038
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,420
both expands the the set of classes

2039
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,699
offered so on the bottom right of this

2040
01:24:41,699 --> 01:24:42,980
slide you see

2041
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:46,159
classes of power supply

2042
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,860
which are sometimes very useful when you

2043
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:54,719
discuss devices and some classes need

2044
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,640
expanded ranges so the the top right is

2045
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,780
trying to go

2046
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:04,560
Beyond class 202 class 3 and so on

2047
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,860
so this is an a document that's that has

2048
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,080
been

2049
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,940
considered useful by people it's pretty

2050
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,640
well cited so we want to complete that

2051
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,420
next slide

2052
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,640
and the other one is the airwig security

2053
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,040
protocol comparison

2054
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,960
um a couple of people have

2055
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,900
uh sat down and and looked at message

2056
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,239
sizes for various configurations of

2057
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,040
security protocols

2058
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,100
and that maybe not the the most

2059
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,860
important information that you need in

2060
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,840
designing your security systems but in

2061
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,340
the end of course you have to make sure

2062
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,620
that you actually can send these

2063
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:46,520
messages so it's useful to have this

2064
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,800
information available and there's also

2065
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,120
energy now to renew this

2066
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,559
uh the next slide please

2067
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,719
so um

2068
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,380
Eric as a working group is 11 years old

2069
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,320
and I have a personal rule that I never

2070
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,080
do anything for 10 years at least not

2071
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,020
the same time for more than 10 years

2072
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:15,780
um so uh yeah this working group is just

2073
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,260
running out of steam it's original

2074
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:22,280
purpose is fulfilled people know

2075
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,860
uh how to build iot systems with idea

2076
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,620
protocols these days so there are just

2077
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,320
these two

2078
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,500
uh Children of the working group that

2079
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,900
really need foster parents now

2080
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,840
and we looked around and somehow thought

2081
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,300
about iot apps

2082
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,860
um well most of the work on these

2083
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:45,540
documents is done so it's not going to

2084
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,880
load down this working group

2085
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:51,139
iot Ops is actually chartered to write

2086
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:54,480
informational documents about iot

2087
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,960
well maybe not exactly these two

2088
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:02,159
documents but well a few

2089
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,139
um close your eyes slightly then then it

2090
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:06,840
looks like it it fits so this would be

2091
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,280
an easy way

2092
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,920
to to get the documents out of a working

2093
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,719
group that's kind of non-functional at

2094
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,600
this uh point in time and and complete

2095
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,020
them in a reasonable amount of time so I

2096
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,480
wanted to

2097
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,100
get some attention to these two

2098
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,900
documents in particular of course to

2099
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,020
seven to 28 bits which we really want to

2100
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,860
complete within the next few months

2101
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:34,260
um and uh ask whether this working group

2102
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:37,139
would be interested in having this in in

2103
01:27:37,139 --> 01:27:41,040
their portfolio obviously the the ads

2104
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,460
have to agree with that or the isg has

2105
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,320
to agree with that because the charger

2106
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,020
is a contract between the working group

2107
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,480
and the isg

2108
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,719
um but uh yeah I think it would fit very

2109
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,639
well and and Brendan's document for

2110
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,260
instance is quite similar to other

2111
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,900
things we have done in Arabic so uh this

2112
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,638
this sounds all very fitting to me

2113
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,420
any comments on this

2114
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,139
so I'm just preparing through two

2115
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:14,820
comments from the chairs first of all so

2116
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,639
yeah we have to uh our ID is gone

2117
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:19,980
so there is no uh direct feedback from

2118
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,840
him and we'll get you through the mic

2119
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,159
first

2120
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:25,320
uh Eric Klein uh responsible area

2121
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:28,020
director for elwig uh yeah I know I have

2122
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:31,020
to dispatch the curve document and then

2123
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,360
um my intention was to

2124
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,159
unless there's new energy that shows up

2125
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:37,500
in eloig was to close it down so I'm I'm

2126
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,480
happy to support moving these documents

2127
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,420
to iot Ops if people want to do it here

2128
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:44,280
um if people want to renew energy and no

2129
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,679
way we that's I I can certainly keep it

2130
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:50,040
open but uh there's been uh

2131
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,600
not a whole lot of energy there for a

2132
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,679
while as you said so I can uh Warren and

2133
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,360
I had some discussion about about this

2134
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,860
but I don't think we uh reached a

2135
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,199
conclusion uh we were pressed for time

2136
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:04,699
in that conversation so anyway

2137
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,179
um constant um

2138
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:12,659
I wonder whether it's uh like elbeek ran

2139
01:29:12,659 --> 01:29:15,300
out of steam but uh maybe it's not

2140
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,980
because of the

2141
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,900
the working group but also with the

2142
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:21,719
content of the working group right like

2143
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:23,219
nobody was interested in the document

2144
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:26,239
other than the authors

2145
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:31,020
well that's a matter of assessment of

2146
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,239
course but it's really hard to work in a

2147
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:34,560
working group whether a group chairs

2148
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,300
don't answer your mail that's in

2149
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,520
challenge um so that may have slowed us

2150
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,320
down a little bit more

2151
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,560
um of course it's also these are not the

2152
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,600
most important documents but they are

2153
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,520
still useful documents to have around

2154
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,460
uh so uh yeah the it's not like

2155
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:53,340
everybody is skewing up uh to make

2156
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:56,280
comments on these documents uh but we

2157
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,560
should still finish so so before

2158
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,480
everybody is like like running out of

2159
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,980
the room because I have one minute left

2160
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,659
at the bottom of the oh I'm gonna do

2161
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:05,040
another poll

2162
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,580
for the people in this meeting if they

2163
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:10,320
think the terminology of this kind could

2164
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,360
be completed here in iot Ops which of

2165
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:13,940
course is just a

2166
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:15,719
litmus test

2167
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:17,699
I think we have to really check with the

2168
01:30:17,699 --> 01:30:20,400
charter and the chairs and it is um

2169
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,159
if that fits so I'm just putting this up

2170
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:25,920
now raise your hand if you as a WG

2171
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,780
attendee here think that the terminology

2172
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,580
document of this kind can be completed

2173
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:34,760
in the iot Ops working group scope

2174
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,699
and again that's a litmus test

2175
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:42,000
you can really only uh go forward if you

2176
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,679
understand that the charter

2177
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,860
and corresponding handing off and

2178
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:50,420
the two ads agree

2179
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,040
let me give it this five more seconds

2180
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,960
otherwise we

2181
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,920
are over time

2182
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,420
and I think I can't count so I'm ending

2183
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,659
this so we have in the end 32 votes

2184
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:10,080
and uh 30 of those were in favor and two

2185
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,139
were an A so that looks like a in-room

2186
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:14,639
preference

2187
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,440
and therefore we will bring this to the

2188
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,360
corresponding IDs and we'll give

2189
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,040
feedback to the rest and that's a

2190
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,300
charity

2191
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:24,060
yeah if the people who don't think so

2192
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,340
could contact me office I don't think we

2193
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,860
have the time to do this yeah here but I

2194
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,900
would like to know what where you see

2195
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,179
the problems whether we maybe can fix

2196
01:31:33,179 --> 01:31:35,420
that

2197
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,440
yeah so thank you everybody that's

2198
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,800

2202
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,059
sorry I'm

2203
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,739
in racing conditions

2204
01:31:55,739 --> 01:31:57,380
