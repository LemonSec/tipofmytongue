1
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,120
hi everyone uh we're going to get

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,460
started soon but just in the meantime a

3
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,680
reminder that you should scan that QR

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,700
code and get in the meet echo system so

5
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,280
you can put yourself in the queue

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,719
um also a reminder to wear a mask

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,039
and just give us a minute while we set

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
up

9
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,840
thank you

10
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,740
oh

11
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,500
um downstairs at the registration but um

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,860
I can go

13
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,899
thank you

14
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm just gonna notify I don't know meat

15
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Echo but we some of the slides we had

16
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,000
uploaded are not yet visible

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,099
not really sure how to refresh that but

18
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,379
we've got a few minutes before that's an

19
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,679
issue

20
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,280
okay I see it now cool thank you it

21
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,940
works it's so funny because

22
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,620
this shows it but when I go to share

23
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,379
pre-loaded slides it doesn't show us

24
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,900
that's probably fine

25
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,180
see they're only these three isn't that

26
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,379
strange

27
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,040
yeah yeah

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
okay yeah sorry I'm just speaking to the

29
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,140
meet Echo folks we've got the slides

30
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,739
um that we need in the uh materials list

31
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,980
but then when I go to share them

32
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,560
decks ready to be shared only has three

33
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,239
of the five

34
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,220
three of the five we've just had a

35
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,840
recent upload in the last few minutes

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,879
but um

37
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,920
yeah see there's a difference between

38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,840
data tracker meeting materials and decks

39
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,560
ready to be shared

40
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
Colin's fixing everything right now

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,580
thank you Colin

42
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,220
got it

43
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,839
that is fantastic thank you okay we're

44
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,399
back on track folks we're going to get

45
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,899
started

46
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,759
um and really the

47
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,540
um

48
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,620
stick to get off this window okay

49
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,600
um

50
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,820
we're all set I'm just gonna pull up

51
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,919
chair slides and we'll go ahead

52
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,120
so this is the human rights protocol

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,699
considerations research group

54
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,300
um this is a two-hour session we have a

55
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,900
two invited talks and

56
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,240
um some pre

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,540
-loaded aob

58
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,500
um and so this is our agenda

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,660
do folks have

60
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,479
comments on this agenda at all

61
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,580
would you like to add yourself to aob

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,720
actually this is not accurate we do have

63
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,180
another update on a on a draft so Sophia

64
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,100
isn't here but I know she wants to be on

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,979
the agenda later for some of her work

66
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,758
other things

67
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,080
all right

68
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,419
um so in

69
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,340
um in that vein I'll also just remind

70
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,820
folks that this is being recorded

71
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
I'll again remind you to scan the QR

72
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,100
code so that you can get into the meat

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,080
Echo System put yourself on the Queue

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,699
when there's time for questions and

75
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,240
discussion

76
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,340
and also my last order of business at

77
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,660
the beginning is to ask if anybody would

78
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,300
mind taking notes during the discussion

79
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,979
this will be

80
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,139
not capturing the talks but rather

81
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,060
capturing the discussion after the talks

82
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,919
and discussion about our drafts can I

83
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,698
get a volunteer

84
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,740
thank you thanks very much Michaela

85
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,360
appreciate you

86
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,380
all right so just in um in the

87
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,240
introduction

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
I have to also remind you of the note

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
well you've maybe seen this a lot but

90
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
for those of you that have just come

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
today

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,280
it's important that you disclose any

93
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
intellectual property interests

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,139
when you're speaking at the ietf and the

95
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,360
irtf

96
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,460
um we also have a privacy and code of

97
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,319
conduct in our note well that's really

98
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,720
important if you haven't read that or

99
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,860
aren't familiar with it you should

100
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,800
re-familiarize yourself

101
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,979
um and so also I wanted to remind us of

102
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,840
the goals of the irtf because this

103
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,819
research group is within that so we're

104
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,560
focusing on the long-term issues

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,539
specifically This research group is

106
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,919
looking at the human rights

107
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,460
considerations of um internet protocols

108
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,039
and the standardization of those and and

109
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,919
we aren't setting standards uh we really

110
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,940
are

111
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,620
um publishing informational or

112
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,419
experimental documents

113
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,699
um but a lot of it is just discussion

114
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:03,840
and talks

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
which I think is a really valuable

116
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,739
Converse contribution to the community

117
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,860
and so we're chartered to research

118
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,720
specifically

119
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
um how internet protocols could both

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,759
strengthen or threaten human rights

121
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,780
and we use their two main documents that

122
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,479
we rely on to Define human rights that's

123
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,860
the universal Declaration of Human

124
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,479
Rights

125
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,699
um and then that's also the

126
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,860
international civil and political Rights

127
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,860
Convention

128
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,360
we've continuously begun like discussed

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
um two rights for the most part it's

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,080
freedom of expression freedom of

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,639
assembly

132
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,160
privacy is of course also a human right

133
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,900
but that is in a different research

134
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,300
group Siobhan is in the room he knows

135
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,800
there's plenty of overlap between our

136
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,360
research groups that's a good thing

137
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,060
and then I think also another wonderful

138
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,699
thing about our objectives is we bring

139
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,280
folks first in human rights into this

140
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
space to also hope that there's

141
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,699
pollination cross-pollination and the

142
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,560
other reduction where they become also

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
more familiar with

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,979
the technical community and the inner

145
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,740
workings of the ietf

146
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,599
foreign

147
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,940
we do have some drafts we're going to go

148
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,710
over them we have some published rfcs

149
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,060
[Music]

150
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,059
um

151
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,320
there are other outputs I think that are

152
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,360
less easy to quantify but tend to be

153
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,458
around sharing information publishing

154
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,899
blogs that sort of thing but you really

155
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,880
have to sort of follow the folks of us

156
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,440
that have been busy in this group for a

157
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,240
long time I'm wondering if aubry's in

158
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,740
the room I see Aubry online she's not

159
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,940
the previous co-chair of this and does a

160
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,980
lot of that as well

161
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,580
um

162
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,440
so work to date

163
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,820
um we you know we've been chartered

164
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,980
since 2015.

165
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,540
um there's a film online that you can

166
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,519
check out

167
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,920
um and then we've had our major work

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,519
published RFC 8280 which is really lays

169
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,640
out all of the human rights

170
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,320
considerations

171
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,760
um and we're currently working on a

172
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,500
document that's near publication well

173
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,300
it's in it's further in the publication

174
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,740
queue

175
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,899
um each and every meeting that sort of

176
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,420
takes 8280 and distills it down into a

177
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,940
sort of more bite-sized work I would

178
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,920
also say that the work to date I'm

179
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,200
including all the talks the invited

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
talks we've had the meetings we've held

181
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
we've held approximately 23 meetings

182
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,300
which is quite a few at this point

183
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,700
um and I'm just approximating because I

184
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,560
haven't actually counted but we've we

185
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,899
usually have about two sometimes three

186
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,839
talks per meeting so we've had 50

187
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,700
invited talks on a variety of different

188
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,200
topics

189
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,820
um there's a lot of discussion about

190
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,800
censorship which is going to be a one

191
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,980
that we will hear about today

192
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,800
um privacy and encryption

193
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,839
various forms of digital security

194
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,899
measures or considerations for groups

195
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,019
that are at risk and most marginalized

196
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,220
variety of emerging Technologies

197
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,760
including blockchain based things and um

198
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,800
environmental sustainability there's

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,240
probably things I'm missing but I just

200
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,980
tried to off the cuff remind like

201
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,600
remember what we've talked about in the

202
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,720
past

203
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,339
we have two current drafts

204
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,779
um we'll hear about both of them today

205
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,519
the updates on those they've both

206
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,100
progressed since the 114 meeting in

207
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,839
Philadelphia this is what I mentioned

208
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,519
before the guidelines for human rights

209
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,320
protocol considerations is a companion

210
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
document to RFC 8280 and then we have a

211
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,160
um a specific draft on free association

212
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,640
um and then this is for later so we'll

213
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,620
get back to these slides I'm going to

214
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,399
first

215
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,040
have us pause there's an important

216
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,899
um piece of the agenda right now I'm

217
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,820
going to ask Tara

218
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,920
to come on if you can

219
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,920
to explain the context here but this is

220
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,440
a sort of last minute addition to our

221
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,640
agenda that we're putting at the front

222
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,620
because I think it's an important

223
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,980
reminder for folks in this space so Tara

224
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,420
I'm just going to hand the mic to you at

225
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,660
this point

226
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,440
thank you Mallory

227
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,220
um

228
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,019
yeah thank you for

229
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,600
um holding this space to talk about uh

230
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,440
Allah and his in his mind of freedom

231
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,360
um

232
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,040
in his own words first and foremost was

233
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,380
uh there is a free and open source

234
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,839
developer He's a Part it was an

235
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,060
important part of our technical

236
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,560
community

237
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,800
he's also a writer a tireless Advocate

238
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,380
and activist with people's rights and

239
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,420
also for many he was one of the symbols

240
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,620
of the twenties of an Egyptian

241
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,899
revolution

242
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,640
um last but not least he's a beloved

243
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,560
colleague friend and member to many and

244
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,839
a loving father to his son khadid who

245
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,760
has been deprived from him as he spent

246
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,100
most of the nine last nine years as a

247
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,140
Prisoner of Conscious

248
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,019
I know it's a special person but his

249
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,579
situation unfortunately is far from

250
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:12,660
special

251
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,459
thousands of people language in Egyptian

252
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,079
prisons unfairly with no access to

253
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
lawyers tried under martial courts and

254
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,519
trumped up charges many just for being

255
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,920
in the wrong place at the wrong time

256
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,959
tens more dying because of terrible

257
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,360
conditions in these prisons in fact a

258
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
large crime was sharing a social media

259
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,100
post about one of those stories

260
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,860
furthermore his lawyer was also arrested

261
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,540
when he went to attend one of Allah's

262
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,620
interrogations

263
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,540
Allah was tried under a State security

264
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,180
Court which is a martial Court

265
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,100
while that was the official reason Allah

266
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,300
is in prison

267
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,100
Allah is also being punished for who he

268
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,880
is

269
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,680
as a symbol for many and for being

270
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,260
someone who always advocates for justice

271
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,839
even when it's not convenient easy or

272
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,060
popular

273
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,720
um

274
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,700
I think as a way in order to deter

275
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,620
others from standing up to tyranny and

276
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,019
in a way to teach him a lesson

277
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,000
Allah is also father and a friend who

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,620
has paid a big price for his activism

279
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,860
the past nine years with almost no sign

280
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,779
of improvement or recourse to Justice

281
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,839
and I went on a limited limited calorie

282
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,940
strike earlier this year

283
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,920
and escalated to a full hunger strike at

284
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,540
the beginning of the cop 27 U.N climate

285
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Forum at the beginning of this week

286
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,040
and I did this because he wants to live

287
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,680
with his family friends and his son and

288
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,540
also because if he were to become a

289
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,399
symbol or a lesson he wanted to do it on

290
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,380
his own terms and teach the lesson he

291
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,980
wants to teach

292
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,700
um in many ways Allah has already won

293
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,040
his fight he exposed the Tyranny and

294
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,800
Injustice he and thousands of others are

295
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,660
are facing by the Egyptian government

296
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,600
and helped share their stories uh of the

297
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,160
thousands and prisons on a global

298
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
platform

299
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,680
he highlighted the empty Planet

300
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,540
attitudes of our world leaders and their

301
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,000
timidness to take any action let alone

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
on climate change

303
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,740
he also mobilized and gave hope energy

304
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,720
and urgency to hundreds and thousands of

305
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,459
people who share his desire for a better

306
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,500
world unlocking new avenues of

307
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,720
solidarity and Global mobilization all

308
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,300
from his prison cell and highlighted the

309
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,740
importance of the human rights as a

310
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,500
Cornerstone of human progress

311
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,019
Allah is doing what Allah does best he's

312
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,940
fighting to save us with all the means

313
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,680
at his disposal

314
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,360
what it means to be seen is what price

315
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,279
he has to pay and whether we can save

316
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,860
him back to give him a chance at living

317
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,839
his life again

318
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,760
we have heard no news from him since he

319
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,380
went on his full hunger strike the

320
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,180
Egyptian government is not giving access

321
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,620
to his lawyers

322
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,279
or um his legal comes is his Consular

323
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,420
access since he's also a British Citizen

324
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,579
and we have not heard any news the only

325
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,079
news we've heard is that there's a fear

326
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,519
that he's currently being force-fed

327
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,420
which is considered a form of torture

328
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,399
at this stage I would have loved to have

329
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,560
like a call of action for you of any

330
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,199
sort in order to help

331
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,480
um ask for your help and and not as

332
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,339
struggle for freedom

333
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,920
but unfortunately like the options seem

334
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,019
very limited at this stage I would ask

335
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,459
maybe that you

336
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,220
um look for the freedom for Allah page

337
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,279
on Twitter or and follow like whatever

338
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,519
actions they propose there at the moment

339
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,260
um in the meantime I thought the best

340
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,100
way to

341
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
um the best way to celebrate Allah at

342
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,060
this point was to share some of his

343
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,180
words because I think like as someone

344
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,800
who is really passionate for technology

345
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,139
uh new technology and

346
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,880
as someone who's also equally passionate

347
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,839
about human rights he would have

348
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,459
appreciated the work of this group and

349
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:48,720
would love to have critically engaged

350
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,680
with it

351
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,779
so I'm sharing some of the words that he

352
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,940
wrote that might be relevant to the work

353
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,240
of of this group that I found

354
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,579
um in this article written in 2016 Allah

355
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,160
was reflecting on

356
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,440
um platform economy and platforms like

357
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,940
uber and how they affect people's rights

358
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,220
um and he was reflecting on it from his

359
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,220
place in the prison cell not having

360
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,000
access to news on demand and just

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
whenever he could read or hear from

362
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,480
magazines that were available to him

363
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
um

364
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,440
Allah says

365
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,760
um

366
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,680
seeing as the standard cues of casting

367
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,420
doubt on official narratives and being

368
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,760
an inverted an advertent offender when

369
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,399
it comes to challenging hegemonic ideas

370
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,160
I find myself in intrinsically doubting

371
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,100
this account of disruptive Technologies

372
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,259
this is despite my usual enthusiasm for

373
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,060
modernization advancement in technology

374
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,940
Information Technology most of all and

375
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,740
despite the many benefits these Services

376
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,040
networks and Technologies offer me

377
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,540
it may be true that the Industrial

378
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,220
Revolution brought widespread affluence

379
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,959
but the painful convolutions that

380
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,420
accompany that were by no means quick to

381
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,099
subside and it was Generations before

382
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,980
things settled neither the luddites nor

383
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,359
their children nor even their

384
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,040
grandchildren reap the fruits of the

385
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,599
Industrial Revolution

386
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,179
and what relative Prosperity abroad was

387
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,280
not the result of Technology alone but

388
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,540
of the interplay between technology

389
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,520
technological innovation and political

390
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,599
reform

391
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
the periods of the regularization of the

392
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,559
work hours the prohibition of child

393
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,780
labor the establishment of industrial

394
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,880
safety regulations and traditional to

395
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,580
minimum wage the negotiation of wages to

396
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,020
collective bargaining the introduction

397
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,660
of regular statutory holidays an

398
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,220
acceptance of the idea that health and

399
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,960
education has rights to be granted in

400
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,059
the form of Public Services funded via

401
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,039
taxation from the profits of the

402
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,539
industrial revolution's beneficiaries

403
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,580
along with many other rights and

404
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,260
protections for the two age liberals

405
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,240
that we take for granted today

406
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,100
it is the same rights and protections

407
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,480
which the fourth Industrial Revolution

408
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,919
is threatening

409
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,660
if industrialized societies had

410
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,280
continued to allow Factory owners to

411
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
employ children for long hours in

412
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,720
inhuman conditions or fail to introduce

413
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,360
progressive taxation based on profit

414
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,780
as was the case early in the industrial

415
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,280
revolution it would not be possible

416
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,080
today to consider Luddite as a synonym

417
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,020
for stupidity and backwardness

418
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,360
most importantly the process of

419
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,860
transformation was a path of better

420
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,480
conflicts between different classes of

421
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,620
interests

422
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,840
liberal rights were invested by force

423
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,280
from States governments and Factory

424
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,260
workers after Decades of protests

425
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,179
struggles and revolution

426
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,460
yes the Lord has were defeated but in

427
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,440
their place came working class Fighters

428
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,480
and activists who did not reject

429
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
progress but sought to impose their own

430
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,200
terms on the course it would take

431
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,240
Elites and ruling classes treated them

432
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,620
with the same violence in the region

433
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,720
method out to the luddites but the

434
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,460
resistance continued and sometimes

435
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,080
protests were so hated that the workers

436
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,360
sabotaged machinery the difference of

437
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,580
course being that where the related Soul

438
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,220
design was a sabotage machinery the

439
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,960
workers so sabotage as a mean to exert

440
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,120
pressure which was rapidly replaced as

441
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,799
unionization and Industrial action

442
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,480
became legal rights designed to take the

443
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,059
place of violence in counter violence

444
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,000
to characterize the historical process

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,960
by the Industrial Revolution as

446
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,400
temporary birthing pains that gave away

447
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,799
to affluence and ease not only obscures

448
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,600
the details of the class conflict within

449
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,640
the major industrial Nations but also

450
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,140
the differing ways Nations experience

451
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,840
those transnational transitional pains

452
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,640
the Industrial Revolution brought about

453
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,620
Colonial expansion and increasing

454
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,080
Colonial violence as industrialized

455
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,059
nations opened new markets and select

456
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,760
new raw materials and Savage competition

457
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,799
between industrialized nations over the

458
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,080
fruits of modernization which resulted

459
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,059
in the outbreak of World Wars

460
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,919
in short the invention of new

461
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,020
technologies may be a given but their

462
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,580
growth in dissemination and the

463
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,780
structure of the markets and power

464
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,820
relations which are based upon them are

465
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,919
far from it they are the results of

466
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,200
political changes which are in turn the

467
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,780
outcome of conflicts within Society

468
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,200
understanding technological innovations

469
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,880
analyzing their effect and cultivating a

470
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,340
healthy skepticism but the propaganda

471
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,400
propaganda narratives which necessarily

472
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,799
accompany them is vital

473
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,539
fighting these Technologies and interest

474
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,520
behind them with the aim of directing

475
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,080
their course curbing the harms they

476
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,660
cause and expanding their benefits

477
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,640
increasing the number of people they

478
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,039
help and compensating those they harm is

479
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,559
therefore also vital

480
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,360
the only people more stupid than those

481
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,620
who stand in the way of History are

482
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,960
those who prostrate themselves before it

483
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,940
they leave no trace or memory at all

484
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,220
even as a cautionary tale to Developers

485
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,520
um that would be that's all I have for

486
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,780
you today

487
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,840
um please um in any way if you can if

488
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,660
you can I know talk to people uh let

489
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,539
them know more about the case help

490
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,120
um we just want to know what's happening

491

492
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,799
um whether he's still alive whether he's

493
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,059
still

494
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,220
um whether he's being force fed and we

495
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,160
also want him to get out safely and um

496
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,080
I'll leave you with his words

497
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,539
you have not been defeated

498
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:10,100
they have not yet been defeated

499
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,880
thank you Tara

500
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,000

now move on to Dimitri's talk

509
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,340
um

510
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,799
so come on up Dimitri I've got your

511
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,039
slides and you can use this pointer but

512
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,620
stand on the pink X

513
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,739
um

514
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,440
second because I don't see your slides

515
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,460
it's

516
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,000
like

517
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,580
for you

518
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,679
and I don't

519
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,720
yeah the slides are loading I just want

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,059
to say hello to everybody

521
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,620
and uh

522
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,320
very difficult presentation to follow in

523
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,240
the mica sorry I mean so you have to

524
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,740
speak right into the microphone sorry

525
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,159
plus that plus the Mask doesn't help

526
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,620
I I remember

527
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,200
um working with Allah in early 2000s on

528
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,320
an Arabic translation of a digital

529
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,880
security reference manual we were

530
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,700
building and

531
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,340
it's been difficult to follow this

532
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,559
unfortunate progress so I do hope that

533
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,780
if you have any means you know via

534
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,760
social media by physical contact with

535
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,200
relevant participants here at the

536
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,940
conference that you do bring up the case

537
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,140
as strongly as possible

538
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,020
all right to the presentation then just

539
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,820
testing the clicker and I'll come back

540
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,460
okay

541
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,179
I just had a recent cover test so don't

542
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,320
worry

543
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,179
how do I go for the slide so do I just

544
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,400
ask you all right

545
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
so my name is Dimitri vitalev I'm the

546
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,840
founding director of a digital security

547
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,100
firm out of Montreal called equality

548
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,780
we've been operational for about 13

549
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,820
years now I've been working in the space

550
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,820
of digital Security Solutions for the

551
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,440
protection and promotion of human rights

552
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,780
for about 20 years

553
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,120
the name equality assumes that this is

554
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,460
what we want to bring to the internet we

555
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,320
want to kind of equal out the playing

556
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,539
field between the users and very often

557
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,580
the victims of this network and the

558
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,679
powers that be you know the corporations

559
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,679
the governments that in large part

560
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,400
have built and control this network

561
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,740
we focus on web security capacity

562
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,600
building sensor resistance I'm going to

563
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
be talking to you about our work on web

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,520
security and censorship resistance

565
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,659
um today

566
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,820
and

567
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,500
I think

568
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,419
to mention right off the bat that all of

569
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,980
the solutions that we developed are

570
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,140
released free and open source

571
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,539
and you can find them on GitHub as well

572
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,039
thank you next slide

573
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,260
all right I'll mention briefly four of

574
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,140
our projects today

575
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,059
um a website security infrastructure

576
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,580
deflect a machine learning framework

577
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,140
that is operating inside this

578
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,380
infrastructure in order to help us

579
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,659
mitigate malicious requests sent to our

580
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:37,679
clients

581
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,440
a censorship circumvention system we

582
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,480
have built called Sino

583
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,960
and an emergency communications project

584
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,299
we have stood up in Ukraine since the

585
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,400
beginning of the war there and that is

586
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,780
basically helping people communicate

587
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,100
with each other when internet

588
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,020
connectivity

589
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,500
is not present I think by and large all

590
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,900
about Technologies are built in defense

591
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,720
of freedom of expression and Association

592
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,400
online

593
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,260
thank you Mallory thanks lab

594
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,720
all right so since 2011 the deflect

595
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,860
project uh has protected numerous uh

596
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,419
Independent Media Human Rights group

597
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,000
democracy movements from various cyber

598
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,679
attacks now these can be the sort of run

599
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,659
of the mill cyber attacks you know which

600
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,100
everybody faces when they're being

601
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,000
online

602
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,159
all the way up to a very well

603
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,520
coordinated and quite massive

604
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,080
um cyber attacks

605
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,320
with uh you know

606
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,940
sometimes evident State adversaries

607
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,620
behind them

608
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,659
and we've been doing this yeah for 12

609
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,360
years now so the deflect Network kind of

610
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,659
offers four Ps to its clients obviously

611
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,880
protection

612
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,400
um and performance it is really a

613
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,980
reverse proxy caching network with quite

614
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,140
a lot of load balancing and intelligence

615
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,039
and elasticity built into the network

616
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,919
by a virtue of you know being in many

617
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,720
locations around the world and doing

618
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,940
caching you know it also kind of speeds

619
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,779
up

620
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:13,140
the delivery of a client's web pages to

621
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,700
their readers

622
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,600
in difference to many other uh efforts

623
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,240
out there this is a network and a team

624
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,940
that is very much defined by its

625
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,880
principles we don't work with simply any

626
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,820
website out there we have criteria for

627
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,980
the type of content our clients

628
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,260
may not present on their websites

629
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,299
including assignment to violence hate

630
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,980
speech so on and so forth and we Define

631
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,559
the processes for how we go about

632
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,140
resolving various abuse complaints that

633
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,700
come in and they do come in quite often

634
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,039
some of them legitimate some of them

635
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,140
social engineering

636
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,960
and by and large this is a philanthropic

637
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,940
service it has a commercial arm it has a

638
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,380
non-profit arm uh all profits you know

639
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,340
derived from offering the commercial

640
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,380
Service uh

641
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,380
channeled into supporting and offering a

642
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,659
free service to various civil societies

643
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,260
out there next slide please

644
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,260
so yeah just briefly how it's built

645
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,539
um as I mentioned before reverse proxy

646
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,659
caching clients point the DNS to the

647
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,400
deflect infrastructure

648
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,559
we make sure various requests are

649
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,020
distributed across our servers in about

650
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,900
25 different data centers now

651
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,659
and within the infrastructure itself uh

652
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,760
clients are obviously offered caching

653
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,799
human support in about six different

654
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,360
languages

655
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,360
uh various analytics on the traffic both

656
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,120
malicious and legitimate coming at their

657
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,919
web presence

658
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,279
it also offers secure hosting for

659
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
websites developing the WordPress

660
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,860
framework

661
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,440
and machine learning about detection

662
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,539
which I'll talk about a little bit later

663
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,440
being an open source infrastructure we

664
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,960
encourage third parties to stand up

665
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,659
their own versions of the left and they

666
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,039
can call it whatever they like really

667
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,799
and this is 12 years of work packaged

668
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,799
into an easily provisionable and managed

669
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,360
architecture

670
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,840
and that you know probably costs tens of

671
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,220
millions of dollars to rebuild from

672
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,860
scratch so go and get it it's free

673
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,779
next slide

674
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,520
about a million people come through our

675
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,919
Network every day about 75 million

676
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,440
unique IPS served on an annual basis

677
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,120
it's around two percent of people

678
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,220
connected to the internet

679
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,919
um and yeah quite a lot of experience

680
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,539
mitigating various attacks

681
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,940
slide

682
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,980
there's a sum of the attacks that

683
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,220
deflect protects its clients from

684
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,100
uh possibly none of these are new to you

685
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,900
uh we are layer seven

686
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,440
uh defenses primarily and we also

687
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,880
protect our clients from quite a few

688
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,740
legal attacks

689
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,580
uh which happen uh you know often enough

690
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,620
several times a month you know we're

691
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,840
getting

692
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,340
quasi-legitimate legitimate to

693
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,919
completely false and erroneous and legal

694
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,000
attacks

695
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,120
by and large without a sort of an

696
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,460
experienced partner protecting a website

697
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,460
you know an invalid dmca take down

698
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,220
request just works even if there's no

699
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,320
DMC content you know that they're

700
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,840
complaining about so we're also there to

701
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,580
help with that

702
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,279
next slide

703
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,380
now

704
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,140
in order to get evenings and weekends

705
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,940
off you know we've had to develop quite

706
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,279
a lot of technology to help us mitigate

707
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,919
these attacks particularly

708
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,440
we also delved into the whole world of

709
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,659
machine-led mitigation you know trying

710
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,020
to figure out how we can train a model

711
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,600
to differentiate between legitimate and

712
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,120
malicious requests

713
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,520
after three years of r d and a lot of uh

714
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,240
wrong turns and directions we finally

715
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,919
found the approach that has become

716
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,320
basketball so we basically trained the

717
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,880
model on recognizing what is human

718
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,039
behavior and thereafter looking at

719
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,960
algorithmic machine-led Behavior as

720
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,159
anomalies

721
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,600
this is an infrastructure called

722
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,740
basketball

723
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,140
and I think one of the main advantages

724
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,539
to it

725
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:29,399
for us and for anybody else who adopts

726
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,380
this kind of framework on their own ends

727
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,899
is that a lot of the pre-processing

728
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:37,620
uh happens at the network Edge and only

729
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,539
you know Vector features are being

730
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,940
communicated into the Clearinghouse so

731
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,620
this is what we believe is a sort of a

732
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,720
private by Design system

733
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,440
even though you're using it to ingest

734
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,179
and make sense of web logs we're not

735
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,520
communicating any pii across the network

736
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,299
um basketball

737
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,539
yeah

738
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,740
is also open source and also I welcome

739
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,720
you to take a look at it on GitHub and

740
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,460
to try and deploy it you can deploy it

741
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,299
either

742
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,820
as a SAS service where you are the

743
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,059
client sending us the vector features or

744
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,500
you can take the whole framework

745
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,840
including the Clearinghouse and try it

746
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,220
out with yourself we ship with the

747
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,640
default model not with the deflect model

748
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,840
next slide please

749
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,940
um yeah on the right hand side this is a

750
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,039
gift that obviously doesn't give inside

751
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,840
a PDF

752
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,620
um

753
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,059
but yeah at the moment basketball

754
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,860
settings are two minute sliding window

755
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,340
uh it can adapt to any web traffic every

756
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,179
IP log entry generates a prediction

757
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,059
and we don't allow the machine to make

758
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,520
the final decision on whether

759
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,960
an IPS representing a human or a bot

760
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,460
anomalies above a particular threshold

761
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,520
are then challenged by the deflect

762
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,520
system uh we send the basically a

763
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,039
reverse shot challenge to the browser to

764
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
prove that there is a browser behind

765
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,080
this IP and and it is not about

766
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
on deflect it is doing about 40 million

767
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,020
lines uh per day and over 35 behavioral

768
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,140
features have been modeled already

769
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,899
next slide

770
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,360
yeah you can see an attack basically in

771
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,320
action

772
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,419
where in the last 24 hours 150 000 IPS

773
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,080
uh have breached the threshold they were

774
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,700
all challenged

775
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,620
and as you can see as well you know a

776
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,539
thousands of those IPS had passed the

777
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,520
challenge meaning it was a false

778
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,100
positive so again I think we feel it's

779
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,480
important not to let the machine make

780
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,580
the final decision here on who's who in

781
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,899
the network

782
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,000
and um

783
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,299
yeah send the challenge to make sure

784
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,960
thanks sly

785
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,299
from about a week ago an example of what

786
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,539
an attack looks like this is a Ukrainian

787
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,620
media from the town of

788
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,500
uh three various attack types

789
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,980
33 million malicious requests quite a

790
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,720
large botnet over over a hundred

791
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,100
thousand Bots

792
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,659
I mean this is basically what the

793
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,399
day-to-day on deflect looks like because

794
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,179
we work quite a lot with heavily

795
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,380
targeted websites you know we're really

796
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,960
uh are I guess a Honeypot for a lot of

797
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,299
the malicious activity happening on the

798
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,340
internet today

799
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,418
next slide

800
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,120
right so moving from the protection of

801
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,840
freedom of Association and uh on the

802
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,460
internet we feel that you know bring

803
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,320
down a website is another form of

804
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,240
censorship you know you can block a user

805
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,919
from accessing particularly resource so

806
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,940
you can destroy that resource as well

807
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,340
um moving on actually from destroying

808
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,659
that resource and the protection that

809
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,460
deflect offers I want to talk to you now

810
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,460
about blocking the user from accessing

811
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,260
particular resources

812
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,440
or the internet in general filtering

813
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,719
censorship and network shutdowns that

814
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,040
we're seeing more and more today

815
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,699
I'm going to focus here on the Ukrainian

816
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,280
use case I think it is very much a focus

817
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,320
for my organization now

818
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,659
you can see here quite an old Network

819
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,000
map

820
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,239
of Ukraine with Crimea still connected

821
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,639
to the Ukrainian Network and the donbass

822
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,199
the east of Ukraine

823
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,599
also connected to the Ukrainian Network

824
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,580
now that is not actually the case

825
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,379
anymore a lot of the occupied

826
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,199
territories have been rerouted to the

827
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,540
runet meaning to the Russian internet

828
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,820
meaning that people living in these

829
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,580
temporarily occupying territories are

830
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,619
part of the Russian internet now and

831
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,080
therefore behind Russian Network

832
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,160
surveillance and Russian censorship

833
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,859
next slide

834
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,619
so I'm going to talk about two types of

835
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,960
internet shutdowns and what kind of

836
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,880
solutions my organization is bringing to

837
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,839
bear

838
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,680
to challenge these kind of shutdowns

839
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,320
um the most prevalent of which

840
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,119
um that I call scenario one in this

841
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,160
presentation you know and that we see

842
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,660
quite a lot around the world you know

843
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,599
from Russia to Belarus to Kazakhstan to

844
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
Iran at the moment you know and to quite

845
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,619
a lot of countries in Africa so on and

846
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,540
so forth Northern India

847
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,599
is the disconnection of popular internet

848
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,579
services you know the Internet by and

849
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,920
large is very much dependent on a few

850
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,140
companies now and if you can block the

851
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,480
IP space of these companies of this

852
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,880
Cloud providers you have virtually

853
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,960
blocked uh any usable internet uh from

854
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,180
the population usually when you

855
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,680
implement a shutdown like this you also

856
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,560
want to Target you know VPN services

857
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,839
that people might use to circumvent

858
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,760
these blocks

859
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,640
next slide

860
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,400
so as a solution for scenario one we

861
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,040
have devised the the Sino browser C

862
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,079
knows an abbreviation of sendship.no

863
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,660
with the model share the web and I'll

864
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,920
explain why

865
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,320
we shared the web next slide

866
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,420
so see now is trying to kind of change

867
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,760
uh or introduce a new generation of

868
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,500
circumvention technology which is not

869
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,720
reliant on connecting to sort of a

870
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,060
single Hub proxy solution whether it's

871
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,339
VPN or something similar

872
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,339
we have actually built uh Cena to use

873
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,400
the BitTorrent protocol for routing and

874
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,780
for distributed storage

875
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,300
um it is the first web browser of its

876
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,640
kind which is actually using the

877
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,640
BitTorrent Network in order to fetch a

878
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,400
particular resource have it inserted

879
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,040
into the bittern DHT and then delivered

880
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,720
back to the user

881
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,200
biggest difficulty was really in

882
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,520
rebuilding this web page on a user's

883
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,920
browser you notice so that it shows you

884
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,960
know in the same way as before allowing

885
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,300
for dynamic connectivity with the

886
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,560
website as well

887
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,460
next slide

888
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,720
Now by virtue of using the BitTorrent

889
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,480
protocol and by virtue of networks

890
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,160
allowing incoming connections to a

891
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,660
particular device

892
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,020
every user of Sino also becomes an

893
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,000
active node

894
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,040
this means that we have as many nodes as

895
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,680
many proxies if you like as there are

896
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,240
users

897
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,480
now this allows any person

898
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,060
here in the UK wherever it is that you

899
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,440
live that

900
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,839
is possible in a network not being

901
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,480
censored to become a routing node for

902
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,099
somebody living in a network that is

903
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,440
being censored your phone's connectivity

904
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,119
is automatically registered inside the

905
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,940
DHT and people in Iran people in Russia

906
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,440
people in other countries undergoing

907
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,260
shutdowns are able to connect to the

908
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,960
rest of the network through you

909
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,940
this is particularly important because

910
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,060
in a scenario number one of Internet

911
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,800
shutdowns your IP is not part of a large

912
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,980
corporate public IP space urp is usually

913
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,339
not included on the block lists of when

914
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,140
internet shutdowns are being implemented

915
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,599
and all you need to do is install the

916
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,880
app and have it open and running a new

917
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,720
phone

918
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,280
this is what we call Cooperative

919
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,440
browsing inside signal

920
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,339
next slide

921
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:39,359
now also by virtue of using BitTorrent

922
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,380
we have

923
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,619
the ability to do decentralized caching

924
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,359
now this is very interesting because

925
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,859
what it means is that when you have

926
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,900
opened a page which is censored in your

927
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,400
particular Network environment the next

928
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,260
person to open a page doesn't need to

929
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,000
leave the network the national Network

930
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,859
anymore they can simply get it from your

931
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,040
phone

932
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,380
and this has been you know a huge Boon

933
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,460
really

934
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,180
for preserving the connectivity between

935
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,879
IPS inside and outside the censored Zone

936
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,579
because frequently requested content is

937
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,380
often important content particularly

938
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,359
during a shutdown

939
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,520
it is only neat it only needs to be

940
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,500
imported into the network you know once

941
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,520
or twice and thereafter thousands or

942
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,660
Millions

943
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,760
of readers can access it without leaving

944
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,480
the Network anymore

945
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,200
this also allows us to continue

946
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,320
content distribution among people inside

947
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,780
the censored Zone once the internet has

948
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,420
been completely external connectivity

949
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,280
has been completely switched up and I'll

950
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,780
come back to talking a little bit more

951
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,920
about this

952
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,040
next slide

953
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,320
in shutdown scenario number two total

954
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,240
disconnection

955
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,440
so

956
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,660
sorry not yet

957
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,460
um

958
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,740
so total disconnection means that either

959
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,599
a cable connecting your particular

960
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,640
Network Village

961
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,520
town maybe even City or the various

962
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,140
cables that connect you to the rest of

963
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,640
the national network which connects you

964
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,740
to the rest of the global Network

965
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,740
are no longer functioning

966
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,599
in the Ukrainian example this is

967
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,540
happening because of military activity

968
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,119
because of bombardments you know regions

969
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,160
are being disconnected from the rest of

970
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,020
the Ukrainian internet and the rest of

971
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,180
the global internet of course that by

972
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,200
default

973
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,260
this means that no proxy is going to

974
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,140
save you you know no clever method is

975
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,460
going to get you out of the Zone because

976
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,599
there is no connectivity

977
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,320
this means that you'll never get to

978
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,540
Facebook or Whatsapp or telegram or

979
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,400
whatever it is that you need to get to

980
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,200
because that is located physically

981
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,380
outside of a town or region

982
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,140
next slide

983
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,420
so to to deal with this problem you know

984
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,020
we're using decentralized uh protocols

985
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,660
and services really I mean um

986
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,640
this centralized internet is being

987
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,560
pitched as number three at the moment

988
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,240
and really I think it's you know number

989
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,140
one

990
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,660
you know the first internet plus you

991
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,760
know internet 2.0 of social media the

992
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,800
centralized internet has equaled the

993
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,540
decentralized internet really but I

994
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,339
think it's a future that is actually

995
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,740
revisiting the past

996
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,540
so

997
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,400
all we need to do in this case is

998
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,619
actually bring the services the servers

999
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,619
the protocols that people need

1000
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,020
to have in order to communicate with

1001
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,260
each other back into their Geographic

1002
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,320
localities back into their Networks

1003
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,660
it's not a very complicated idea but

1004
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,000
we've just moved away from that so far

1005
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,119
in the last 20 years or so

1006
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,980
um I think now with the pushes behind

1007
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,280
web 3

1008
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,560
we are beginning to realize the

1009
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,359
opportunities that were lost and what we

1010
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:04,079
can regain once again by bringing

1011
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,599
either the servers closer to the users

1012
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,339
or getting rid of this notion altogether

1013
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,560
and considering that we are all you know

1014
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,440
we can all be service to each other

1015
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,780
obviously email is an old example of

1016
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,839
this as now you know growing popularity

1017
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,400
is the Matrix protocol you know

1018
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
decentralized Federated protocol and

1019
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,220
decentralization is really key behind a

1020
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,599
lot of the technology that we're

1021
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,560
developing now for censorship resistance

1022
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,859
next slide

1023
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,660
so once again back to Ukraine uh the

1024
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,240
project that we stood up uh in early

1025
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,900
March after the second invasion began

1026
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,339
was based really on collating and

1027
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,500
presenting

1028
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,300
um a readable menu and a few user guides

1029
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,720
and to the Ukrainian population we went

1030
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,200
and sourced machines with as many

1031
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,339
[Music]

1032
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:00,540
um

1033
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,660
isps who actually still had hosting

1034
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,220
racks in their vicinity in the locality

1035
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,260
um at the moment the decoms project is

1036
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,960
uh in nine different regions of Ukraine

1037
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,740
uh also inside occupied territories

1038
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,020
and each of those servers basically

1039
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,920
presents ready to go uh Matrix chat

1040
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,020
rooms

1041
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,560
um actually next slide

1042
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,960
and ready to go Matrix chat rooms with

1043
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,819
the the new sort of interface that the

1044
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,980
Matrix team is developing element and

1045
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,140
that allows people to have a either web

1046
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,780
interface or an app interface in order

1047
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,119
to talk on Matrix channels there are

1048
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,619
public rooms

1049
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,200
uh where hundreds sometimes thousands of

1050
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,180
people are using to communicate with

1051
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,560
each other there are obviously private

1052
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,880
rooms where we don't know what is

1053
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,740
happening

1054
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,300
um aside from metrics we're also

1055
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,460
offering them the decentralized micro

1056
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,420
blogging platform Mastodon uh so in nine

1057
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,700
different locations also with Federation

1058
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,680
set up and working

1059
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,140
uh we're offering each of the services

1060
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,780
also a Delta chat server and Delta chat

1061
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,760
is another messaging system that is

1062
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,859
actually using the SMTP protocol for

1063
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,660
communications with end-to-end

1064
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,000
encryption by pgp

1065
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,599
and the Briar chatting system uh which

1066
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,060
by default uses the tone Network as its

1067
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,520
primary Communications protocol and

1068
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,119
fails over to Bluetooth mesh device to

1069
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,980
device connectivity in the absence of

1070
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,660
any internet altogether

1071
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,660
now mesh connectivity you know is not

1072
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,480
necessarily an ideal solution for every

1073
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,339
use case but when you consider that many

1074
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:42,720
people

1075
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,760
in Eastern Europe are living in large

1076
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,619
blocks of flats

1077
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,200
or may find themselves you know inside a

1078
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,660
bomb shelter

1079
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,880
or you know maybe even protesting or

1080
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,560
being outside in the street in a similar

1081
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,000
space you know Mesh networking

1082
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,920
becomes a very useful tool in the

1083
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,960
absence of any other communication

1084
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,339
options

1085
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,819
and obviously we are also

1086
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:11,339
um offering offline downloads of some

1087
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:15,740
technology including the senior browser

1088
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,480
next slide please

1089
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,599
now the Sino browser is underpinned by

1090
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,540
what is essentially a core technology we

1091
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,540
have developed called winet

1092
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,240
um so win it is the library that is

1093
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,619
doing all of the the centralized caching

1094
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:38,700
content delivery

1095
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,760
bringing requests to the edge of the

1096
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,040
network where

1097
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,660
um web pages are being imported into the

1098
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,579
DHT signed distributed delivered so on

1099
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,060
and so forth so we net is uh available

1100
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,740
as an SDK

1101
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,440
for the Android platform and as an open

1102
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,760
source library in I think

1103
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,940
C plus

1104
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,700
uh which can really work with any type

1105
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,460
of traffic you know with instant

1106
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,940
messaging with the email so on and so

1107
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,520
forth so CNO is the application layer

1108
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,180
sitting on top of vnet and we net is a

1109
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,500
library that you can be using inside

1110
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,619
your Technologies for decentralized

1111
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,800
Content distribution

1112
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,800
authenticated content distribution

1113
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,740
next slide please

1114
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,839
so what we're trying to do now for

1115
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,280
networks experiencing disconnections

1116
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,560
is not have content imported to the

1117
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,920
network simply by user requests but

1118
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,540
actually

1119
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,660
um preemptively going to crawl an entire

1120
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,540
web resource let's say it's Wikipedia or

1121
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,920
let's say

1122
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,319
it's the Guardian news side or whatever

1123
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,440
and preemptively injecting that into the

1124
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,460
network

1125
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,700
so the weekroll tool uh also in

1126
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,760
collaboration with web recorder is now

1127
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,119
tasking itself with the crawling

1128
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,119
scraping whatever you like web resources

1129
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,300
that we believe are essential to people

1130
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,099
um living inside uh Sunset Network

1131
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:28,260
and these web resources are then

1132
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,359
accessible to the user as the guardian

1133
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,280
website is normally via this in a

1134
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,380
browser you know even if there's no way

1135
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,819
to get to the guardian but we have

1136
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,280
injected all of their resources into the

1137
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,540
DHT

1138
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,700
they can access it by the web browser

1139
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,339
using the normal URL as before

1140
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,180
next slide

1141
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,579
then we need a Content delivery

1142
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,200
mechanism we need a transport you know

1143
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,440
to be able to bring this script packages

1144
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,740
into a disconnected Network so obviously

1145
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,440
this internet satellites and you know

1146
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,260
Elon Musk is

1147
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,000
had his Heyday in uh

1148
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,700
in Ukraine until recently until some of

1149
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,700
the latest outbursts uh with a promotion

1150
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,060
proliferation of The Styling system

1151
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,839
um

1152
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,140
internet uh satellite internet is a

1153
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,579
solution in locations where it is

1154
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:22,079
accessible and where it doesn't present

1155
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,380
a greater danger to the users by virtue

1156
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,579
you know being quite easily geolocated

1157
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,260
um another thing that we're doing is

1158
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,400
actually looking into placing data

1159
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,740
packets inside

1160
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,839
um TV satellite streams TV satellite

1161
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,660
broadcasts which are obviously one-way

1162
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,520
Communications but that is kind of all

1163
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,599
we need

1164
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,619
so we can have a overt TV channel and a

1165
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:52,579
cover Channel inside that

1166
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:55,740
delivering data into a country where

1167
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,819
there are a lot of TV satellite dishes

1168
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:01,680
next slide

1169
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,020
so we're trying to piece all of this

1170
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,339
together now

1171
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:09,119
basically figuring out which web

1172
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,460
resources are in demand and hopefully

1173
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,260
we're not the ones really deciding all

1174
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,119
the time that we can

1175
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,700
have a way to crowdsource these requests

1176
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,760
you know which web resources people

1177
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,800
living inside a disconnected Network

1178
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,980
want to have present on their Network

1179
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,440
then

1180
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,839
um scraping those resources turning them

1181
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,240
into web cash

1182
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,160
delivering them inside

1183
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,839
the sensor Zone

1184
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,560
and using the winet infrastructure

1185
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,380
present on people's devices on people's

1186
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,140
computers

1187
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,119
to propagate it inside the censored Zone

1188
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,400
thereafter so basically rebuilding

1189
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,859
pieces of the internet

1190
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:55,079
pieces of a static internet by virtue of

1191
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:58,800
whip cache inside a sensored Zone

1192
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,760
next slide

1193
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,060
and this is the penultimate slide and

1194
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,819
with the proposal for the protocol stack

1195
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,280
right there at the end

1196
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,599
um

1197
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,400
the

1198
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,579
ability for us yeah

1199
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:21,540
to use this Sino Network as a means to

1200
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,359
propagate a web cache

1201
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:27,780
is efficient because we only need a few

1202
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,819
injection points you know we don't need

1203
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,579
the entire population to have the

1204
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:35,280
injected content you know we only need a

1205
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,740
few people nodes to be able to receive

1206
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,220
it thereafter propagates peer-to-peer

1207
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,319
at the moment we are trying to come up

1208
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:45,359
with a sort of a multi-thronged approach

1209
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,000
to see how best to deliver this content

1210
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,740
and not settling maybe on a single

1211
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,420
channel of delivery but weighing up the

1212
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,040
pros and cons of each different Channel

1213
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,960
and I think a goal for 2023 will be to

1214
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,540
decide what to do with a lot of the web

1215
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,359
cache that we already have by virtue of

1216
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,280
running the deflect Network

1217
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,500
and this is with a protocol pitch comes

1218
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,420
in you know deflect as I mentioned in

1219
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,859
the beginning is a web caching

1220
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,500
infrastructure as well reverse proxing

1221
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,140
creating web cache distributed to to

1222
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,079
users a million people are generating

1223
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,960
cash on our Network at the same time

1224
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,660
ideally we would want to have this cache

1225
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,119
immediately available inside the winner

1226
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,760
Network it just makes sense a for us as

1227
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,260
a company running both infrastructures

1228
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,540
disparate infrastructures

1229
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,540
both of them dealing with web cache in

1230
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,599
various ways and for

1231
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,440
um

1232
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,920
a similar goal and that is content

1233
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,040
accessibility

1234
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,240
we don't have a protocol that would

1235
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,099
allow us to take you know web cache

1236
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:58,140
generated by nginx and put it into

1237
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,599
um the BitTorrent DHT so that it is read

1238
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,460
in the same way you know on the Firefox

1239
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,680
browser it is something we're beginning

1240
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,359
to actually

1241
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:09,780
uh think about and hopefully present to

1242
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,300
you in the upcoming conferences of how

1243
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,000
we can have a interchangeable web

1244
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,900
caching standard

1245
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,559
and the final slide please

1246
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,319
um since you'll have the PDFs of this uh

1247
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,359
you'll be able to come back through this

1248
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,040
presentation that I went through rather

1249
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,440
quickly here you have the links to the

1250
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,660
various projects that I mentioned one I

1251
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,520
didn't mention I'm just actually out of

1252
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,220
Kiev now where we launched the naidino

1253
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,440
platform which is a national digital

1254
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,839
security helpline

1255
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:44,280
um that is meant to serve the entire

1256
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,099
population with the most basic digital

1257
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,960
security questions

1258
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,079
and we are working with the global nog

1259
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,780
Alliance on the keep Ukraine connected

1260
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,000
program

1261
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,640
um at the moment you might have uh seen

1262
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,559
on the news power is a huge electricity

1263
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,800
power generation power delivery

1264
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,059
distribution is a huge problem in

1265
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:13,140
Ukraine and many of the isps cannot

1266
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:18,000
serve their clients during blackouts

1267
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,859
um It All Happened very suddenly of

1268
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:21,740
course Russia targeted electricity

1269
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,180
distribution centers

1270
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,520
and although Ukraine has the electricity

1271
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,500
needs it cannot distribute it everywhere

1272
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,300
including to these isps they only had

1273
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,280
UPS's you know there as a normalized

1274
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,440
speed would which lasts for about an

1275
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,579
hour

1276
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,900
so we're trying to import about a tons

1277
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,700
of batteries

1278
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,200
um lithium gel

1279
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,540
anything we can get our hands on the

1280
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,579
nearby region uh has been kind of

1281
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,200
stripped of batteries

1282
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,740
and through the global nogalines deliver

1283
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,160
these batteries to various isps so if

1284
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,819
you do have some time use the QR code

1285
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,980
check out the global novel lines and

1286
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,619
cooperate with them donate to them and

1287
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,920
yeah help us keep Ukraine connected

1288
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,260
thank you I'm not sure if I have time

1289
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,960
for questions we we certainly do have

1290
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,700
time for percussions um I think it's

1291
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,200
important so I there's somebody in the

1292
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,180
queue also a reminder to everyone to

1293
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,040
just join the queue if you can through

1294
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,599
the meet Echo

1295
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,619
um function and yeah go ahead Carlin

1296
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:28,980
uh Colin Perkins with no hats

1297
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,680
um so I think this idea of the um the

1298
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,220
Sino browser using uh bittorrents and

1299
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,099
the super skills is interesting

1300
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:39,240
um

1301
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,520
obviously there's a lot of personalized

1302
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,500
content in the internet

1303
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,660
um do you have measures of how effective

1304
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,640
the web caching is given all this

1305
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,559
content because you know clearly

1306
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:50,880
something personalized to me can't

1307
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,099
effectively be cached

1308
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:56,760
yeah very much so yeah I mean

1309
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,920
the internet really at the moment you

1310
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,839
know isn't built to be cached and

1311
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,000
recreated somewhere else so actually

1312
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,160
quite a lot of the you know the five

1313
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,020
years of trial and error and that went

1314
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,500
into Sino was to build the intelligence

1315
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,480
into the Sino client itself to figure

1316
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,300
out what to cash and what not to cash

1317
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,040
um so any kind of cookie authenticated

1318
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,200
content

1319
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,559
uh automatically is only transmitted to

1320
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,760
the requester and isn't cached in a DHT

1321
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,640
um also the user inside the settings has

1322
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,559
the options to switch on and switch off

1323
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,240
whether they want to Cache this content

1324
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,040
and share it with others yeah

1325
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,280
okay makes sense my other question was

1326
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,200
um you know this is obviously very

1327
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,780
effective for providing connectivity

1328
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,619
um does it provide any form of uh onion

1329
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:48,180
rooting or

1330
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,859
um so traffic analysis resistance

1331
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,140
um by default no and we're very clear

1332
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,940
about that in our documentations that

1333
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,980
you know this isn't a network anonymity

1334
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,960
this isn't really even a network for

1335
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,680
privacy it doesn't really add too many I

1336
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,119
mean I think it kind of balances out the

1337
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,099
primary properties it adds and the

1338
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,140
Privacy properties that actually gets

1339
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,540
rid of uh so yeah we're trying to be

1340
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,760
very clear that this is really content

1341
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,160
delivery system for censorship

1342
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,240
circumvention uh having a content

1343
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,579
uh sharing your content with others you

1344
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,079
know allows you to see who's requesting

1345
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:27,059
that content from your device as well so

1346
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:29,099
yeah we're trying to be very clear in

1347
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:33,240
our documentations of its advantages and

1348
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,700
disadvantages too by not misrepresenting

1349
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,859
what it isn't yeah yeah sure sure I

1350
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:39,480
think it would be interesting to explore

1351
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,300
to what extent uh the the pin Network

1352
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,960
could be used for onion rooting style

1353
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,559
um

1354
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,839
you know to try and provide some of this

1355
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,059
resistance very much bouncing the

1356
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,740
traffic around yeah anyway yeah yeah

1357
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,118
okay thank you thank you

1358
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,859
uh hi there thanks for the presentation

1359
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:04,940
dkg you're just a little soft

1360
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:09,420
you're going through the presentation

1361
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,800
and

1362
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,780
um and thanks for the interesting work

1363
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,160
um I had a question that was similar to

1364
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,980
uh what Colin asked which is um

1365
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,319
uh so

1366
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:22,020
so in addition to the sort of risks of

1367
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,359
targeting a distribution I mean we just

1368
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:25,200
heard

1369
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,280
um

1370
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,579
about the you know risks to people for

1371
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,040
sharing specific content

1372
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,440
um it seems like your devices can share

1373
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,660
specific content through these uh

1374
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,520
through something like Xeno

1375
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,740
um even more explicitly this is your

1376
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,140
your device right

1377
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,640
um

1378
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,280
I I wonder if you have any thoughts

1379
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,059
about how

1380
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,319
uh

1381
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,160
if there are defenses there and then the

1382
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,520
other uh similarly with a

1383
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,440
with sharing content you know it seems

1384
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,579
like this is a Content distribution

1385
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,500
means of getting information into

1386
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,020
censored areas but it's not clear to me

1387
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,240
how it gets information out of censored

1388
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,800
areas

1389
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,359
so somebody within the censored area

1390
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:13,559
might be interested in what people are

1391
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,900
outside because they're saying

1392
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,720
um but uh

1393
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,819
I don't I don't know from the

1394
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:22,020
description I didn't understand whether

1395
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,839
it was possible to also uh

1396
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:27,960
uh get news out from within the firewall

1397
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,160
can you talk about that

1398
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,619
yeah thank you dkg

1399
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:38,099
um so yeah on the kind of uh guilt by

1400
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,440
connection or Guild by association front

1401
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,220
I mean what we've tried to do is make

1402
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,680
DHT traversal

1403
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,339
um

1404
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,740
very complicated if not impossible in a

1405
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,559
way that we're using uh the particular

1406
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,859
bits are in protocols so you can't crawl

1407
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:57,900
the DHT to figure out

1408
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,819
who is doing what you can see people

1409
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:01,920
connected to the DHT you cannot see the

1410
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,799
content that uh they're requesting a

1411
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,319
sharing inside the DHT itself

1412
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:09,960
yes you can be you know a malicious

1413
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,839
actor or let's say a law enforcement

1414
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:14,220
actor

1415
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,160
and download the legal content to see

1416
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,099
who connects to you in order to retrieve

1417
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,420
it but then you're also guilty of

1418
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,819
downloading it as the people maybe

1419
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:26,040
unwillingly so connect to your device to

1420
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,780
get it from not a very strong defense

1421
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,500
but nonetheless I think that has some

1422
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:36,119
uh legal footing to it in some instances

1423
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:37,500
um

1424
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,480
all PDP

1425
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,760
efforts I believe you know I have this

1426
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,099
chicken and egg problem you know we need

1427
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,660
a big haystack

1428
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,660
and until there are millions and

1429
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,420
millions of nodes and users and a lot of

1430
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,480
you know content of various

1431
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,020
uh origin and uh various interest in the

1432
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,280
network

1433
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,720
um

1434
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,480
these problems you know are I think a

1435
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,559
lot more serious and a lot more

1436
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,420
prevalent until then

1437
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,339
when there is a huge amount of content

1438
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,319
inside the network of all sorts and

1439
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,299
types I think

1440
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:15,480
the statistical probability that you're

1441
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,280
going to figure out a network of

1442
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,200
activists by downloading you know the

1443
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,319
amnesty org page through Sino and then

1444
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,180
seeing who connects to you to share it

1445
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,440
uh decreases

1446
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,720
um

1447
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,619
so I I want to understand how you how

1448
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:37,020
house you know is thinking about the the

1449
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:40,099
authenticity questions as well right so

1450
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:42,480
your your description of one of the

1451
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,920
legal defenses

1452
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,000
um

1453
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,040
for say law enforcement seeing who

1454
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,260
connects to the MSC page well

1455
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,700
unfortunately simply claim that they

1456
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,339
have the amnesty page right inject that

1457
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:57,240
claim into the DHT and then the law

1458
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,380
enforcement wouldn't themselves be

1459
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,880
retransmitting the NFC page they'd just

1460
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,420
be looking to see who comes crawling the

1461
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,619
DHT

1462
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,359
to think they have the amnesty page

1463
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:07,799
right so they wouldn't actually be

1464
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:09,059
redistributing the content themselves

1465
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:11,280
they're just doing a surveillance

1466
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,680
Gathering or something like that are

1467
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,280
there authenticity protections available

1468
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,280
um

1469
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:23,720
I think

1470
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:23,940
[Music]

1471
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,260
um

1472
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,960
I'll deflect your question a little bit

1473
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,660
uh for the interests of time

1474
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,839
um I will just talk quickly about one

1475
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,000
type of authenticities that I think I am

1476
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,359
qualified enough to discuss maybe we can

1477
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,960
go back to slide 23 just quickly

1478
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,900
uh authenticity of content injected into

1479
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,819
the network and then delivered to the

1480
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:51,059
user happens through uh content

1481
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:53,579
signatures which are made by injectors

1482
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,380
as you see on the right hand side of

1483
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,640
that diagram

1484
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,599
uh run by well in this case equality but

1485
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:03,299
anybody can stand up their own winit

1486
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:05,520
infrastructure and if you want to serve

1487
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,559
you know web content through it run your

1488
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:09,420
own injectors

1489
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,940
so injectors are signing the content and

1490
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,980
this content packet carries the

1491
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,540
signature throughout its life cycle

1492
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,119
inside the DHT

1493
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:18,839
um

1494
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:21,180
signature validation is hard coded into

1495
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,078
the casino client

1496
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,760
um but maybe yeah on your other question

1497
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,859
of authenticity

1498
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:31,920
inside the DHT I'll I'll just deflect it

1499
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,200
for I think lack of

1500
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,440
uh uh ability to give you a concise or

1501
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,020
maybe even a correct answer

1502
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,720
um but please uh maybe post it as an

1503
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,319
issue in a censorship no

1504
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:49,020
uh report on GitHub and uh

1505
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:53,000
we'll answer it there if you don't mind

1506
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:57,960
so I have sort of a related questions to

1507
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,700
Ted lemon um

1508
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,460
first of all uh there it seems like

1509
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,200
there are two ways that you could attack

1510
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,359
this in order to by the way this is

1511
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,579
really cool I don't want to imply this

1512
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:10,619
is bad I'm just like thinking with my

1513
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,260
how do we defend it hat on

1514
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,359
um two ways to attack this uh one would

1515
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,339
be

1516
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:19,920
is it possible for a bad actor to put

1517
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,020
bad data into the cache

1518
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,859
simply by deliberately providing enough

1519
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:28,079
instances that are producing that data

1520
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,940
that nobody else feels like they need to

1521
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,260
produce it is there a defense against

1522
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,660
that

1523
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,520
do you see what I what I'm saying yeah

1524
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,200
okay

1525
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,259
um

1526
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,839
the request for new data

1527
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:45,119
uh

1528
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,520
uh in the current Sino architecture

1529
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,520
comes from the user Itself by the URL so

1530
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,980
the URL is a really key piece of

1531
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,299
addressing and routing in our system

1532
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:59,420
um

1533
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,700
this request is communicated to the

1534
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,099
injector

1535
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:07,559
inject their IPs are also unfortunately

1536
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:10,559
for the time being hard-coded into the

1537
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,400
client

1538
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,020
and

1539
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,000
if the injectors are not accessible

1540
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,280
because the sensor as well can get you

1541
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,400
know a copy of the Cena browser then you

1542
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,319
know the entire network of others you

1543
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,579
know users that have incoming

1544
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:25,619
connections become Bridges to that

1545
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:28,740
injector now as I just mentioned

1546
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,540
injectors are run by quality in this

1547
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,119
instance and it is them who fetch

1548
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,880
content requested by the URL and then

1549
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,220
sign it before injecting it okay so it's

1550
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,500
signed with your keys yeah okay so that

1551
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,359
that's that seems like a good defense

1552
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,339
against that attack the other sort of

1553
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:46,740
obvious attack is if somebody manages to

1554
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,260
suborn your infrastructure so that they

1555
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,299
have access to your keys and potentially

1556
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:52,920
your infrastructure and can inject bad

1557
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,220
data that way have you what's your

1558
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,859
feeling about the or what you know what

1559
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:00,420
are you what's your thinking about that

1560
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,380
problem

1561
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:05,400
look I mean also not a short answer yeah

1562
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,260
uh also we do understand that in this

1563
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,579
particular use case where people want to

1564
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,380
browse the web because that's where the

1565
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,180
content is we need to deliver the web we

1566
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,500
need to have an interface between the

1567
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,119
web and the DHT which is the injectors

1568
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,440
the injectors are a point of

1569
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,079
vulnerability we do do protect them

1570
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:22,880
using just you know internal

1571
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,460
um company experience and you know

1572
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,819
um best practices

1573
01:05:28,819 --> 01:05:32,520
and to protect them we do have a

1574
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,380
some experience because of the deflect

1575
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,380
project on how to do that

1576
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,900
um but yeah there are several points of

1577
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,119
vulnerabilities in the network uh

1578
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:45,299
definitely not foolproof and definitely

1579
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:46,319
yeah

1580
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,119
the more

1581
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,339
heads we can use to improve the system

1582
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:53,220
the better cool yeah I mean it seems

1583
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,740
like there's an opportunity for uh you

1584
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,140
know right now web web uh Publishers

1585
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,140
don't generally they do provide

1586
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,460
authentication for web pages but it's

1587
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,980
not provided with this particular use

1588
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,720
case in mind no yeah it would be

1589
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,920
interesting to see if there's a way to

1590
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,319
leverage that so that

1591
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:13,740
the burden is no longer on you to be

1592
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,020
you know that's it and I think this is

1593
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,480
where the web caching standard uh could

1594
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,420
come in very handy yeah because okay if

1595
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,220
we are moving to web point three we're

1596
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,020
gonna need to deal with decentralized

1597
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,640
content in the centralized networks

1598
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,900
again

1599
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,579
you know we can't assume that there's

1600
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:30,900
going to be a Tillis connection to

1601
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,880
Twitter all the time and we don't want

1602
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,640
that actually in web 3. so we will need

1603
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,339
to figure out you know

1604
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:43,020
how to deal with uh you know with a HTML

1605
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:48,240
kind of uh ecosystem and

1606
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:48,980
um

1607
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,240
decentralized protocols which I think

1608
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,980
you know it's not very difficult we just

1609
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,160
need to actually come back to that space

1610
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,280
cool thanks so much thank you

1611
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,559
Dimitri thanks so much

1612
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,539
um and thanks for the questions I think

1613
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:04,799
they're really good this is part of the

1614
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,299
reason why we really wanted to invite

1615
01:07:06,299 --> 01:07:08,760
Dimitri here today because they I think

1616
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,260
have a lot of real world use cases for

1617
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,460
this kind of hard problem and um it's

1618
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,960
not the first time it's been brought up

1619
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,059
in the ietf either so hopefully we can

1620
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:23,160
continue that conversation

1621
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,859
um but yeah we're now going to shift to

1622
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:28,859
um Corinne who's giving the next talk

1623
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:30,359
um Corinne do you want to share the

1624
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:33,539
slides yourself since you're remote or I

1625
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:35,520
can I can also pull them up and pass you

1626
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,859
the control however you prefer okay let

1627
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:40,020
me do that

1628
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,259
foreign

1629
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:55,319
you should have control now

1630
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,160
so go ahead

1631
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,079
I'm not sure your audios oh there you

1632
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,359
are okay good that invites me welcome

1633
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:16,700
green I think it's uh muted

1634
01:08:17,299 --> 01:08:21,238
pick up Sophia yeah yeah that's yeah I

1635
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:23,460
think Korean is muted Corinne we can't

1636
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,738
hear you unfortunately

1637
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:29,279
um you look like you're unmuted on in

1638
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,920
Meet Echo but maybe oh no she can't hear

1639
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,279
me either

1640
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,880
Corinne

1641
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,139
okay we're not able to hear you

1642
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:57,660
no

1643
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,660
um

1644
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,120
yep

1645
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,620
so that we heard you for a moment

1646
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,339
um

1647
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:43,580
let me try again

1648
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,960
is video and audio coming through okay

1649
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,859
now

1650
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:48,238
it's great

1651
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,919
so let me get your slides back up

1652
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,140
and pass through the control

1653
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,679
thank you go ahead welcome

1654
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,560
um so hey y'all I really appreciate the

1655
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,199
opportunity to to present some of my

1656
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,000
research work

1657
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,739
um today I really wanted to be in the

1658
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:09,120
room but unfortunately I had to leave

1659
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,800
somewhat early

1660
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,739
um so we're gonna do it like this

1661
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:14,640
um

1662
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,380
this might be a little bit repetitive

1663
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,760
for some of the people who were at my

1664
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,699
irtf talk uh on Wednesday but I just

1665
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,020
want to make sure that everyone is at

1666
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,120
the same level

1667
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,820
um so I wrote both my master thesis and

1668
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,280
my PhD on the ietf

1669
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,659
and what I'm going to be talking about

1670
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:33,360
today is some of the work

1671
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,380
um

1672
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:37,860
in my research which tracks what hrpc

1673
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:40,260
has been doing and then raised some

1674
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,120
critical questions as to like where we

1675
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,159
potentially could go next

1676
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,020
um and as I said for those who attended

1677
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,480
my anrp talk the first slides will be

1678
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,000
familiar but I do promise I will take a

1679
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,820
hard left at around slight uh 10 or 9

1680
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,320
and really focus on the human rights

1681
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,600
work

1682
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,760
so there's really four sections I'm

1683
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,080
going to talk again a little bit about

1684
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,980
being an anthropologist in the ietf

1685
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:07,500
the work that hrpc has been doing since

1686
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,960
2014

1687
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,540
um some of my findings in terms of the

1688
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,340
role that human rights have played in

1689
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,659
the ITF actually way before hrpc existed

1690
01:11:17,659 --> 01:11:21,620
and where we go next

1691
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,500
um uh just a bit of context hi my name

1692
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,840
is Karin I'm an Anthropologist of

1693
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,699
Internet governance cultures

1694
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,080
um I'm a research affiliate at the

1695
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,239
University of Cambridge

1696
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:35,159
um some people might also know me in my

1697
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:37,320
role as the VP of research at the open

1698
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,760
Tech fund

1699
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,140
um I'm not presenting here in that

1700
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,960
capacity this is very much me as the

1701
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,140
left academic

1702
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,480
um some of the people might know me as

1703
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,659
the person who occasionally gets quoted

1704
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:54,179
um when there are kerfarfels in the iitf

1705
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:56,219
about what appropriate behavior is this

1706
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:58,380
is a key part of the research that I've

1707
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,960
done for my PhD and if you want to read

1708
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,699
more about some of the problems that

1709
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:04,800
I've seen in the community you can find

1710
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,739
it on the link below in a piece aptly

1711
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,360
titled what is wrong with loud men

1712
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,460
talking loudly the itf's culture wars

1713
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,239
now

1714
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:17,239
um

1715
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,739
I always find it easier when talks start

1716
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:22,679
off with sort of the one of the key main

1717
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:24,719
takeaways also has a bit of a

1718
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,840
provocation to keep you engaged and for

1719
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,980
you to start thinking of the different

1720
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,020
ways in which you're going to argue that

1721
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,600
I am wrong

1722
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,659
um so the main takeaway from this talk

1723
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:38,340
is the sum of controversial one at least

1724
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,380
for this community and if there's one

1725
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,840
thing that I truly hope that sticks with

1726
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,120
you today it is that the ITF is

1727
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,080
political inherently and that it always

1728
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,080
um has done political and policy work to

1729
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,600
different degrees

1730
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,360
uh and the question uh demo comes is

1731
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,920
that has happened not just in political

1732
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,020
explicitly

1733
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,600
um political spaces like hrpc

1734
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,060
um so what does that mean for for this

1735
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,040
group's work going forward and what kind

1736
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,360
of an impact

1737
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,520
um it would like to make

1738
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,840
so

1739
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,679
um I've been involved in the hrpc work

1740
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:18,120
since its beginning actually since

1741
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,060
before the group was was founded

1742
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,140
um and

1743
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,460
I just remember those early

1744
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,920
conversations really showing me how much

1745
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,860
of a fascinating place this community is

1746
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:32,219
for anthropologists like myself

1747
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:35,159
um and to do that I have to talk a

1748
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:37,920
little bit about anthropology as a field

1749
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,360
um many people tend to think of

1750
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,980
anthropologists as social science

1751
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:43,980
researchers who go to like far away

1752
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,280
um islands and um study cultures of

1753
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,719
people who are very different from

1754
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,100
ourselves

1755
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,260
um to sort of study the Argonauts of the

1756
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,179
Western Pacific to bring in some really

1757
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,400
classic anthropological work and this

1758
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,560
for the longest time was the focus of

1759
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,020
anthropologists but that is clearly no

1760
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,820
longer the case

1761
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,440
um anthropologists at this point in time

1762
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,840
are are everywhere and especially since

1763
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,120
the 1970s there's been this real

1764
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,640
critical shift in the fields where

1765
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,080
instead of

1766
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:13,679
um

1767
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,020
often focusing on people who are less

1768
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,340
powerful than the Anthropologist

1769
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,080
studying them we focus on people who are

1770
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,179
more powerful we call that

1771
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:23,580
um lifting The Gaze up at the most

1772
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,520
powerful in society and we study our own

1773
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,860
societies and not just societies

1774
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,140
um that are different from ours and that

1775
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,020
means that we now also study

1776
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,540
um well-known tech companies I mean

1777
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,760
there are anthropologists in places like

1778
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,159
Facebook Google

1779
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:42,480
um Twitter

1780
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,600
godspeed to them but also in lesser

1781
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,440
well-known Tech communities like the ITF

1782
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,260
um so a bit of work about what we do as

1783
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,360
anthropologists now we study human

1784
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,060
behavior and cultures through a very

1785
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,780
distinct set of methods and methodology

1786
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:04,440
so direct engagement with people that

1787
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,900
that collectively make these cultures by

1788
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,520
participating in their world so in my

1789
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,500
case to make this more concrete for my

1790
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,940
PhD I essentially spent three years

1791
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,280
doing field work within the ietf and the

1792
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,520
irtf uh and I did in the interviews

1793
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,280
field work as well as analyzing mailing

1794
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,340
lists and RCS and a bunch of other

1795
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,320
documents produced by the ITF or around

1796
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,640
the iitf

1797
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,040
and what this type of research really

1798
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,020
allows me to understand is the kind of

1799
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,120
cultural conditions

1800
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,640
um that have shaped how Protocols are

1801
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,880
made and for this particular talk

1802
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,580
um I'm looking at like what hrpc has

1803
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,400
done within the ITF and the irtf and

1804
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,020
it's and how to think about the kind of

1805
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,840
impact that the coup has had

1806
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,560
um

1807
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,380
which brings me to my talk today

1808
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,239
um human rights works in the ITF and

1809
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,840
irtf uh where are we and where are we

1810
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,980
going

1811
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:01,020
now

1812
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:02,820
some of you in the room might actually

1813
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,460
recognize the still on this slide from

1814
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,580
the net of Rights movie that was made in

1815
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:12,320
2015 by Nielsen over and Joanna Varon

1816
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,880
for which they interviewed various ITF

1817
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,739
Engineers to explore the relationship

1818
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,020
between internet protocols and the

1819
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,840
promotion and protection of Human Rights

1820
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,480
um now it's really tempting to start a

1821
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,719
talk about the role of Human Rights

1822
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:31,020
advocacy within the ITF by saying it all

1823
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,699
started in 2014 when the hrpc group

1824
01:16:34,699 --> 01:16:38,100
was was started and approved or started

1825
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,080
by Nielsen over avidoria and Joanna

1826
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,920
farron and approved by Lars and I will

1827
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,239
certainly get back to that moment in

1828
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:48,719
time but I do think as a researcher it's

1829
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,840
also my role to say we need to trace the

1830
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,120
work on rights within the ITF Beyond

1831
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,280
these more recent times because it

1832
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,340
doesn't if we just start in 2014 I'm not

1833
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,560
doing Justice to what essentially I see

1834
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,659
is the long Arc of public interest

1835
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:06,000
technology advocacy that has occurred in

1836
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,659
the ietf

1837
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,980
um so

1838
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,940
it would be possible to also start

1839
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,580
tracing debates within the ietf and irtf

1840
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,640
about the impacts uh impact of protocols

1841
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,280
on a number of items known in Revelation

1842
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,219
um that is another starting place

1843
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:28,920
but there's also an argument to be made

1844
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,500
uh that we can point to the publication

1845
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,260
of RFC

1846
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,659
6973 on privacy considerations

1847
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:38,219
um spearheaded by Alyssa Cooper I know

1848
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:41,280
this in 2013 as a starting point of sort

1849
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,320
of Rights conversations in the broad

1850
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,900
ietf

1851
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,760
or

1852
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,340
um I could start even earlier with the

1853
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,260
participation of folks like John Morse

1854
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,940
in the iitf who wrote one of the most

1855
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:57,719
sort of explicit IDs uh internet drafts

1856
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:59,520
about the policy implication of protocol

1857
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,060
Works in 2010

1858
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:06,000
or uh if you follow the work of

1859
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,920
Professor sander Brahman who is

1860
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,020
essentially done very beautiful and

1861
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,980
comprehensive uh studies of early RCS we

1862
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,199
can essentially Trace policy including

1863
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:18,120
human rights considerations all the way

1864
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,100
back to the founding days

1865
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,159
um of the ietf

1866
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:25,800
so uh I think I have sufficiently

1867
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,120
belabored the point that I'm trying to

1868
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,520
make which is that political questions

1869
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,000
including debates about rights have in

1870
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,520
one form or another always been part of

1871
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,219
the iitf's discussions

1872
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:40,620
um for one because technology in many

1873
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,420
ways is politics by other means there's

1874
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,699
various academics uh convincingly shown

1875
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:48,000
but more practically I guess

1876
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,480
um because ITF Engineers have always

1877
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,060
considered their technology also in the

1878
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,100
context of its deployment in The Wider

1879
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,860
World which inherently means about

1880
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,199
thinking about politics in terms of like

1881
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,659
the kind of power relations

1882
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:06,840
um in in historically contingent

1883
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,940
um structures that end up influencing

1884
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,560
how protocols get used

1885
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,780
now this does raise an interesting

1886
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,159
question

1887
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,380
um if human rights and policy

1888
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,820
considerations have always been part of

1889
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:21,300
the ITF why has the work of the human

1890
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,679
rights protocol considerations group

1891
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,960
been so contentious

1892
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,580
um upsetting so many people especially

1893
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:29,219
in its in its early days

1894
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:31,560
um and to do this I will now move back

1895
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,440
uh to hrpc and give a bit of an overview

1896
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,679
of its um trajectory

1897
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,360
so

1898
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,520
um as I mentioned in October in 2014

1899
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,960
three human rights Advocates Nielsen

1900
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,840
over avidoria Navarone essentially came

1901
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,080
to uh Lars Eckhart the irtf chair at the

1902
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,480
time with with an interesting idea

1903
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,400
um they wanted to research how internet

1904
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,219
standards would impact human rights

1905
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:01,080
um and related as part of that they were

1906
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,699
interested in developing guidelines that

1907
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:05,280
ITF Engineers could use to Think Through

1908
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,880
the potential impact of their uh of

1909
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,760
their document of their Technologies on

1910
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,460
uh on rights and the idea in their words

1911
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,860
was to preserve the internet as a human

1912
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,980
rights enabling environment

1913
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,900
now to achieve these goals they set up

1914
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,420
the human rights protocol considerations

1915
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:27,239
research group in the irtf

1916
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:31,020
and then in 2017 the group published its

1917
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,460
uh its first RC RC RFC 8280

1918
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,219
um which uh is entitled Research into

1919
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:40,080
humanized protocol considerations and

1920
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,239
that outlines different questions that

1921
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,100
one can ask of the technology to

1922
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,659
understand how it might have broader

1923
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:46,920
implications

1924
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,960
for policy and rights

1925
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,060
now after the publication of this human

1926
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,920
rights document

1927
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,560
um it has not it has not seen a lot of

1928
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,080
wide take up so sometimes you do see

1929
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,179
people say we have a small human rights

1930
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,580
consideration section uh in our document

1931
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,699
but not very often and on Wednesday I

1932
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:09,360
talked a little bit about how that is in

1933
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,420
part due to the fact that there is some

1934
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,699
cultural hesitancy on the part of of

1935
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:17,580
many in the ietf to explicitly talk

1936
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,260
about rights

1937
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,179
um given that they worry about what kind

1938
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:23,640
of outside scrutiny that might invite or

1939
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,460
how it undermines how the ITF does work

1940
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,020
which is not

1941
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,340
um because it's just not very

1942
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,440
comfortable with not human rights as

1943
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,000
such but the different

1944
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,920
um centralized institutions like the UN

1945
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,140
that are tied into the human rights

1946
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,780
people framework

1947
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,760
um that being said

1948
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,580
the group has had

1949
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,219
um has had influence and impact in in

1950
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:49,140
very different ways

1951
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:51,300
um their work their presence is well

1952
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:55,860
cemented uh not just in irtf but in ietf

1953
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,320
um a number of people who came into the

1954
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,460
ietf uh myself included

1955
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,940
um are now present in different ways

1956
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,860
they are

1957
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,199
um with ITF leadership they've set up

1958
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:12,420
other research groups they participate

1959
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,540
in ITF working groups

1960
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,280
um Etc

1961
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,690
and

1962
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,080
[Music]

1963
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,580
um

1964
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,520
all of this to say that the HR PC group

1965
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,679
might not have had the kind of narrow

1966
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,380
impact it had initially set out for

1967
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,980
itself namely getting ITF Engineers to

1968
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:35,699
take on our c8280 but the existence of

1969
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,920
this group of people with an expertise

1970
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,900
at the intersection of standards and

1971
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,940
rights has had a really interesting

1972
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,100
impact on technology development in the

1973
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,440
iitf in a much broader way in a way that

1974
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,020
perhaps the folks who started it hadn't

1975
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,239
even imagined

1976
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:53,340
now I want to get back to some of of

1977
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,840
these more interesting and positive

1978
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,520
impacts of this community in a later

1979
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,960
slide

1980
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,580
um but first I want to sort of go back

1981
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:00,960
to some of the discussions we've had

1982
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,540
here uh over the past years in

1983
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,080
particular the one around politics

1984
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,540
um there are multiple reasons why the

1985
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:12,360
hrpc work was so contentious

1986
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,040
um part of it obviously has to do with

1987
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,719
like the political uh the political

1988
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:17,580
economic reality of protocol development

1989
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:20,820
and deployment which meant that adding

1990
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,800
human rights considerations to documents

1991
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,440
was seen as perhaps slowing things down

1992
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,420
adding complexity doing all these things

1993
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,159
when it wasn't clear like what the

1994
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:31,739
benefit would be necessarily

1995
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:32,780
um

1996
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:35,280
likewise you know there were some issues

1997
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,500
around potential mitigation strategies

1998
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,540
for human rights impact that were in

1999
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,580
tension with economic considerations of

2000
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:44,580
latency or efficiency a problem that is

2001
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:47,580
obviously well known to the ietf we see

2002
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,199
it come up in in other working groups as

2003
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,580
well

2004
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,739
um

2005
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:54,600
but one of the the concerns that I

2006
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,219
really want to foreground today is a

2007
01:23:56,219 --> 01:23:57,360
cultural

2008
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,100
um sort of conditions that shape the

2009
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,719
human rights discussions

2010
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,239
and the worry that exists amongst the

2011
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:07,440
many ITF Engineers about making these

2012
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,900
um these impact these political aspects

2013
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,620
of their work more explicit

2014
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:15,179
excuse me

2015
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:19,140
so the concern being that if the ITF is

2016
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:21,360
more explicit about how it work is

2017
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,920
political

2018
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,440
um this might actually

2019
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,179
um invite unwanted scrutiny and outside

2020
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:29,219
regulation

2021
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:31,020
um there is also a worry that it would

2022
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,580
open them up to the demands of a number

2023
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,219
of actors including governments uh who

2024
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:36,840
will want things that many in the iitf

2025
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,699
considered to be bad technical practices

2026
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,520
like undermining or backdooring

2027
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,719
encryption scheme for example

2028
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,199
um

2029
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:49,679
and the the problem is that or the

2030
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,780
apartment for the hrpc group is that

2031
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,460
their demands

2032
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,980
um of human rights were seen as being

2033
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,560
unwanted impossible

2034
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,060
um even if maybe technically they

2035
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,739
weren't

2036
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:03,120
um and so for instance one of my

2037
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,760
interviews interviewee said so for

2038
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,260
example I agree that it would be wrong

2039
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,360
for the ITF to start taking positions on

2040
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,460
economics saying that we need an

2041
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,440
anti-capitalist ITF will be kind of

2042
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,640
stupid right

2043
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,560
um it's never going to happen anyways so

2044
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,300
for the credibility of the organization

2045
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,640
for its sponsors for the people here who

2046
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,500
make use of the Technologies developed

2047
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,900
it would make no sense to do overtly

2048
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,559
political things

2049
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,300
um

2050
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:33,060
that being said uh following the Snowden

2051
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,640
Revelations sometimes the political

2052
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,500
moment trumps these worries and ITF

2053
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,960
Engineers do take up political debates

2054
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,780
and translate them in technical ways as

2055
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:46,800
for instance we saw with RFC 70 to 58

2056
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,300
um pervasive monitoring is an attack

2057
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,699
that came out after the Zone Revelations

2058
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:53,040
now some of the folks who co-authored

2059
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,600
that might be in the room I mean

2060
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,060
obviously can't see if Stephen is there

2061
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,280
and he and I have been having some

2062
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,840
conversation about the extent to which

2063
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,719
this was or was not overtly political

2064
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:06,719
um but I would love to hear uh your

2065
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,820
thoughts on what made that moment so

2066
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:11,040
unique that it was possible to actually

2067
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,920
get this document uh published because I

2068
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,659
do see it as a political stance even

2069
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:18,000
though it's couch in technical terms

2070
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,620
uh and for those wondering about my

2071
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,600
choice of slight pictures here I guess I

2072
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,340
was going for the message that sometimes

2073
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,860
politics are as run-of-the-mill in the

2074
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,219
itfs as our cookies

2075
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:32,699
now uh going back to hrpc how do we

2076
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:35,880
think about its role in the ietf and the

2077
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,500
irtf

2078
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,780
um and if we look at the use of RFC 8280

2079
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,280
it seems pretty minimal

2080
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,340
but I do think that no pun intended this

2081
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,719
would be too narrow a standard for

2082
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,820
judging the impact of the group uh and

2083
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:55,139
in my PhD research I outline hrpc's

2084
01:26:55,139 --> 01:26:57,659
influence in terms of its role as a

2085
01:26:57,659 --> 01:26:59,100
landing pad for people who are

2086
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,540
interested in the intersection between

2087
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,179
politics and protocols

2088
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:05,159
um as a bit of a

2089
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:07,260
safe space for engineers who are looking

2090
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,179
to

2091
01:27:08,179 --> 01:27:11,340
repoliticized protocols as a place where

2092
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:14,340
people can be mentored and grown help to

2093
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,560
grow into different roles in the ietf

2094
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,480
including in leadership as a number of

2095
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,820
hrpc folks have done

2096
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:23,580
um so in other words how I have have

2097
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,800
theorized your group is really as having

2098
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,860
various bridging function functions so

2099
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:31,560
merging between new folks and people who

2100
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,260
who have been here for a long time

2101
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:36,060
between end users especially from the

2102
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,860
majority World whose views are not

2103
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,679
necessarily represented here in the sort

2104
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:42,600
of technical slash awkward interests

2105
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,300
that are well represented at the IHF

2106
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,280
um but also between activists who focus

2107
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,080
on systemic issues around racism and

2108
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,320
sexism and those working in the ITF to

2109
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,139
make it more open and accessible

2110
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:56,940
a bridge between the research in the

2111
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:59,219
irtf and the technical work that happens

2112
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:01,800
in the ietf approach between political

2113
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,440
and Technical debates etc etc

2114
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,179
so

2115
01:28:09,179 --> 01:28:11,960
um where in the first couple of years

2116
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,000
uh many of the people who started in

2117
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,219
hrpc actually stayed within the Narrow

2118
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:18,540
Lane that they had carved for themselves

2119
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,659
in the irtf that is clearly no longer

2120
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:22,620
the case

2121
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,060
um and that's also where some of the

2122
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,940
strength of the group really lies in in

2123
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,159
its way to provide a virgin function and

2124
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:30,719
a landing pad and a place for

2125
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,420
experimentation and contrarian views

2126
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,060
um that you know that the ITF tends to

2127
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,340
say it really appreciates

2128
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,800
um but more importantly what I want to

2129
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,320
drive home is the notion that

2130
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,840
the work that the hrpc has been doing is

2131
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,580
not necessarily

2132
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:48,560
um

2133
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,520
exceptional

2134
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,199
um or totally coloring outside of the

2135
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:53,639
its boxes

2136
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:56,580
um it really I truly do see uh hrpc as

2137
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,139
an extension

2138
01:28:58,139 --> 01:28:59,699
um of the long Arc of public interest

2139
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:01,920
representation within the ITF

2140
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,199
uh but bringing in a new and wider set

2141
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:07,679
of concerns uh including around issues

2142
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,020
like environmentalism and racism but

2143
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,000
also by connecting the kind of work that

2144
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,280
some people do in their day jobs too

2145
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,920
that is maybe not as technical nature to

2146
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:21,260
discussions that are happening here

2147
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:22,500
um

2148
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,020
corvadis okay cover this a really fancy

2149
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:27,719
way of saying a Latin uh where do we go

2150
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:28,800
next

2151
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,840
um the biggest question that I see for

2152
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,300
hrpc is how it wants to keep

2153
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,360
repositioning itself within the ITF irtf

2154
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,340
ecosystem

2155
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,780
um there are obviously a number of

2156
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,760
different routes you could take uh

2157
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,620
including one in which it becomes a

2158
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:46,320
space uh for broader consideration of

2159
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,719
politics and policy development and how

2160
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,120
those impact the ITF

2161
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,480
um and and how to potentially respond to

2162
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,219
those

2163
01:29:56,219 --> 01:29:58,380
um now there are plenty of thorny

2164
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,520
questions I believe that could benefit

2165
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,679
from the unique perspective perspective

2166
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,120
that this group can can leverage

2167
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,340
together and whether it's ongoing

2168
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:08,280
government repression and surveillance

2169
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,760
um or like the kind of examples that uh

2170
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,440
D matches brought by the work that

2171
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,080
equality is doing having those kind of

2172
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,900
voices have a space within the irtf and

2173
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,820
ietf is is incredibly important and I

2174
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:24,239
feel the Community Values it as well

2175
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,219
um it's not necessary for me to say what

2176
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:28,800
the best way forward is

2177
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,139
um but I am very interested as I know

2178
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:34,320
you are and having that discussion

2179
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,840
um so I think I will I will leave it at

2180
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,699
that and just thank you for being given

2181
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:41,340
the opportunity to present and if you're

2182
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,840
interested in my research there's a link

2183
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,320
below to the entirety of my uh PhD

2184
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,300
thesis

2185
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,739
um I wouldn't recommend reading the

2186
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:52,380
whole uh 19 19

2187
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,760
000 words but maybe

2188
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,260
skimming a bit here and there if you're

2189
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,219
interested thank you so much

2190
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:04,860
[Applause]

2191
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,380
thanks uh thanks Corinne folks feel free

2192
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,260
to get yourselves in the queue

2193
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,780
I'm going to cut it though because we

2194
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:15,739
have to move on

2195
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,480
thanks Quinn this is Elliot

2196
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,760
um once again congratulations on your

2197
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,300
NRP award it's very well deserved

2198
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,040
um as somebody who's been participating

2199
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,139
in this group as an engineer from the

2200
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:33,360
beginning with some amount of

2201
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,699
trepidation at different points a great

2202
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:38,400
amount of trepidation I want to make two

2203
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,840
comments

2204
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,120
uh the first is

2205
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:42,900
um

2206
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,780
I think a lot of us especially uh senior

2207
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,040
engineers

2208
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,580
uh struggle with this group in in not

2209
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,020
just the group but the concept of Human

2210
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:54,420
Rights because at the end of the day we

2211
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,600
find that there's no right answer for us

2212
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,659
uh that anything we do can be used for

2213
01:32:00,659 --> 01:32:01,920
great harm

2214
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,060
uh or great good

2215
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:08,400
um and so that brings me to

2216
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,780
uh

2217
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,699
my second point which is where to go

2218
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:13,500
from here

2219
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,620
um

2220
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:19,920
the value I think of this group

2221
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,320
to me at least has not been in

2222
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,760
Publications

2223
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,100
from the group but rather

2224
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:30,300
in the presentations to the group

2225
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,860
um which I've learned a lot from by the

2226
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,780
way and uh for that I'd like to thank

2227
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:35,159
both the current chair the previous

2228
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:39,860
chairs and the presenters themselves

2229
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:40,739
um

2230
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:43,020
one of the things that I would suggest

2231
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,659
is that we figure out a way and I don't

2232
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:48,360
I don't think we just means the hrpc but

2233
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,239
we meaning the broader Community uh to

2234
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:53,580
surface the presentations perhaps the

2235
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,580
ones that are uh that maybe this group

2236
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:59,520
thinks are most important

2237
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,920
um to the broader Community

2238
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,080
um with uh maybe some suggestions about

2239
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:09,360
the ramifications to uh uh the ietf I'm

2240
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,340
not quite sure how to do that

2241
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,100
so I'll I'll stop there just to say it's

2242
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,900
an inkling of an idea and I think maybe

2243
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:20,599
uh maybe the group can pick it up or not

2244
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,659
hi uh Colin Perkins

2245
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:31,560
um

2246
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,080
thank you Elliot I think that's an

2247
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,980
interesting idea uh I

2248
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,120
um

2249
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,040
I think I you know thank you for the

2250
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:45,179
talk Karen uh I agree very much with uh

2251
01:33:45,179 --> 01:33:48,360
your your points I think hrpc has had a

2252
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:51,540
pretty wide impact in the ITF and the

2253
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,480
irtf um

2254
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,300
and I I agree I think also that it's not

2255
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,520
so much with the documents uh it's worth

2256
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,679
bringing the people in let's bring it's

2257
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:02,760
with

2258
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,400
be explicitly bringing in people with

2259
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:08,280
different viewpoints uh and bringing

2260
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,320
them to the ITF community and exposing

2261
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,560
the community to those viewpoints

2262
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,300
um I think this is a very good thing we

2263
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,820
need we need this diversity of use

2264
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:20,040
um we are nowhere near diverse enough in

2265
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:23,159
the ATF and the artf and the more we can

2266
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:25,920
do an hrpc does that in one small way

2267
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,159
and in one access of diversity and I

2268
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:30,300
think that's a great thing and I think

2269
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,040
if we could try and bring in more people

2270
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,080
from our proxies of diversity I think

2271
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,520
that would be uh

2272
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,380
a very beneficial thing for the

2273
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,179
organization

2274
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:40,800
um even if there would be growing pains

2275
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,840
with the different viewpoints and the

2276
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,659
different clashes of view

2277
01:34:45,659 --> 01:34:49,339
so I hope we can continue to do that

2278
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,900
um I also strongly agree that we have

2279
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:56,360
always discussed politics in the ITF

2280
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,260
one of the examples I thought you were

2281
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,940
going to bring up but didn't is RFC

2282
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,980
1984.

2283
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,980
for example which is a very political

2284
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:07,320
document and one which we explicitly

2285
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:12,440
discussed economics from back in 1996.

2286
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,460
um I think what's changed now is that

2287
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:15,960
we're finally starting to admit that

2288
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,699
we're discussing politics

2289
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:19,139
and I think that's a very good thing

2290
01:35:19,139 --> 01:35:22,040
thank you

2291
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,699
uh thanks Karen this is uh Adrian

2292
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:30,900
Farrell

2293
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,159
um

2294
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,860
yeah I I rarely managed to get to these

2295
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,420
physical meetings because there's this

2296
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,520
sort of agenda going on where where

2297
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:42,179
people are having other working groups

2298
01:35:42,179 --> 01:35:46,620
um and I think that's part of the issue

2299
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:50,639
so when I work on a protocol document I

2300
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:51,840
know I need to have security

2301
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,440
considerations but I also know that I

2302
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,840
don't know much about security

2303
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,280
and

2304
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:03,120
um the ietf helps me with that by

2305
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,699
providing a core of people I can go and

2306
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:08,159
consult

2307
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:08,880
um

2308
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,340
what I think we're missing and is

2309
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:14,159
probably the next step is to try to get

2310
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,679
a human rights directorate I don't like

2311
01:36:16,679 --> 01:36:18,480
the word directorate in this sense but

2312
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,639
in a review team Maybe

2313
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,219
who cannot tell me what I'm getting

2314
01:36:23,219 --> 01:36:25,460
wrong in my protocol and what I must do

2315
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:29,520
that can ask me the questions

2316
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,179
so when I look at the guidance RFC I I

2317
01:36:33,179 --> 01:36:34,980
get to about page three and I've glazed

2318
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:37,739
over because I've got protocol work to

2319
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:40,500
develop I need somebody who can help me

2320
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,719
bridge the gap

2321
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,480
um from my protocol to what should I be

2322
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,280
thinking about

2323
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,340
and possibly by the time I'm writing a

2324
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,500
detailed protocol spec in the depth of a

2325
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,840
working group it's too late

2326
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:58,739
what we need is a kind of up level

2327
01:36:58,739 --> 01:37:01,440
uh almost like a working review of The

2328
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,179
Working groups

2329
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:06,980
not review the protocols

2330
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:20,699
Niels you should be able to

2331
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:23,639
come on Mike if you want I closed the

2332
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:25,679
queue but I'm I'm happy if you want to

2333
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,920
jump in

2334
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:31,080
we can't hear you though

2335
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,380
no

2336
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:36,960
there you are yep

2337
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,040
you hear me no

2338
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,880
okay

2339
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,719
thank you for the question I I do not

2340
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,580
have a good academic Citation for

2341
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,320
landing pad I actually try in these

2342
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,120
talks to stay away from academic

2343
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,400
academic lingo as much as I can because

2344
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,780
I don't necessarily find it super

2345
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,980
helpful

2346
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,800
um but I think the question in that

2347
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,020
sense has answered itself

2348
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,820
um because three of the people who just

2349
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,280
took the time to listen to my talk and

2350
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,320
come up with really interesting and

2351
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,960
considerate responses to it we're all

2352
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,840
people who have been at the IHF for for

2353
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,760
a long period of time and who all

2354
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,100
self-identified as Engineers so it's

2355
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,739
definitely a two-way street and I think

2356
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:49,199
again like the the point that Colin made

2357
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,000
that like one of the one of the

2358
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,440
strengths of this group is that it

2359
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,659
brings together people

2360
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:56,520
um and that those people are also taken

2361
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,940
serious uh is is really key

2362
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:02,340
um Beyond or in addition to all of the

2363
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:03,960
different documents that that the group

2364
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,500
is producing

2365
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:13,739
so I I put myself in the queue

2366
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,719
um to kind of come back in on some of

2367
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:17,639
the suggestions and to thank folks for

2368
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:19,620
making them and also to thank you

2369
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,139
Corinne because you've created the space

2370
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:24,600
and the discussion that really is

2371
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,300
self-reflective and helps us I think as

2372
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,159
a as a research group grow and get

2373
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:31,500
better so some of the suggestions to

2374
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,840
make that work more visible I I could I

2375
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,159
couldn't agree more I think we need to

2376
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:37,080
think about that

2377
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,300
um as well the idea of a directorate I

2378
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,340
mean it's been tried as somebody also

2379
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,139
mentioned in the chat

2380
01:39:43,139 --> 01:39:45,360
um there wasn't always it wasn't always

2381
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,520
well received but I do think your

2382
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,739
iteration on the model Adrian was useful

2383
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,719
and that it's not about

2384
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:54,179
telling people what they've got wrong

2385
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:55,560
um although that is what directorates

2386
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,900
and the IDF usually do right I mean from

2387
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,340
a security perspective or whatever that

2388
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,080
is you know what they're set up to do I

2389
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,000
think it is more of a come along and

2390
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,620
let's try to work out some of these

2391
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,960
trade-offs or actually even expose that

2392
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,719
there is maybe a trade-off so

2393
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:10,380
um

2394
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,139
I think that point is well taken I would

2395
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:14,520
also say

2396
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,199
um that's what maybe the guidelines

2397
01:40:16,199 --> 01:40:18,120
draft is meant to do as well is to sort

2398
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,100
of document that write it down make

2399
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,219
people aware that that work can be done

2400
01:40:23,219 --> 01:40:26,280
and then come to hrpc for

2401
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,739
um the expertise so that all explicit

2402
01:40:28,739 --> 01:40:31,500
goals I agree we could all be doing

2403
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,300
a better job so

2404
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:34,560
um I think we ought to move on because

2405
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,139
actually we have we have to update on

2406
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:39,780
drafts and and a few

2407
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,060
um pieces of aob including

2408
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,800
um which we probably won't get to

2409
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,719
um a request to maybe recharter slightly

2410
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:47,760
so grin let's thank her one more time

2411
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,219
congratulate her for her award thanks

2412
01:40:50,219 --> 01:40:51,900
for coming we wish you could have been

2413
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,880
here in person

2414
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,199
all right

2415
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,719
um okay so let me get back to

2416
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:01,100
my slides

2417
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,199
okay well the current work we have so

2418
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:11,460
I'll have

2419
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:14,880
um folks who are working on any of the

2420
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,900
current work go ahead and throw

2421
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:18,060
yourselves in the queue we'll go sort of

2422
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,580
rapid fire update

2423
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:22,020
um but the first one is on guidelines

to 8280 it um

2435
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,480
condenses guidelines for people trying

2436
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:55,139
to gauge the impact of the protocols

2437
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:57,000
they're designing on human rights it's a

2438
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,659
set of guidelines this document is under

2439
01:41:59,659 --> 01:42:03,540
IRSC review we received two reviews from

2440
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:07,320
Jane coffin and Brian Dremel and we this

2441
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,820
week all of the comments have been

2442
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,679
addressed um

2443
01:42:10,679 --> 01:42:14,699
so yeah uh just uh I'm hopefully the

2444
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:16,980
draft will proceed after that but um

2445
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:19,860
yeah the I I signed a summary of the

2446
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,119
changes

2447
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:24,540
on the mailing list uh yesterday just

2448
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:27,420

really appreciate that update and it's

2452
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,940
also in the data tracker good

2453
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:42,559
cool check check

2454
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,580
um

2455
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:50,639
yep go ahead Nick on freedom of

2456
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:54,119
Association so this is I'm a co-author

2457
01:42:54,119 --> 01:42:56,400
on that so we've got Nick as doc

2458
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,360
Shepherd

2459
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,820
um and also Neils so

2460
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:02,280
yeah feel free to give us an update

2461
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,519
please

2462
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:08,400
yeah just a very brief update um

2463
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,900
last

2464
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:12,960
um IDF we talked about uh making some

2465
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,719
edits uh Niels to that and I've just

2466
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:17,100
finished another

2467
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:18,659
um round of review and I have an open

2468
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:21,360
pull request with some edits there

2469
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,400
um I think we've addressed the sort of

2470
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,560
confusion about considering the same

2471
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,420
protocol and different issues I think

2472
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,340
that's um sort of clearer to read now

2473
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:31,860
and so I'm I'm hopeful that after those

2474
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:34,380
minor edits we could go back to the

2475
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:36,600
research group for our last call and and

2476
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,900
progress from there so uh no no big

2477
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,060
changes but I do think there have been

2478
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:45,300
some improved edits and and hopefully we

2479
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,619
can make it even more readable

2480
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,960
so if I'm hearing you right Nick there

2481
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,980
will be

2482
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,320
you're requesting a few additional

2483
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,139
changes and then we can progress is that

2484
01:43:58,139 --> 01:43:59,340
right

2485
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:01,320
that's right

2486
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,820
thanks for that Niels I don't know if

2487
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,860
you wanted to respond but I'm going to

2488
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:07,679
as a co-author with my hat on I'll need

2489
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:09,900
to look over what those are

2490
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:12,119
in terms of what timeline I think that

2491
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:14,040
will take

2492
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:17,460
okay great Neil says thanks

2493
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,920
we'll work on it all right so we do have

2494
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,239
one more

2495
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:23,699
um piece of work that I would um didn't

2496
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:26,040
put on this slide but is in our agenda

2497
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,500
so apologies to Sophia for that Sophia

2498
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,020
come on the mic and I know you have

2499
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,659
slides as well you can

2500
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:35,460
um you can go ahead and share those or I

2501
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:37,679
can share them and pass you but

2502
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,320
I think

2503
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,639
all right go ahead and tell us all about

2504
01:44:41,639 --> 01:44:42,960
it because I've not got on the slides

2505
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,400
there you are perfect

2506
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,980
there you go uh so hey everybody

2507
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,440
um we also wanted to talk a little bit

2508
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,600
about upcoming work that is happening

2509
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,520
right now this is not an official draft

2510
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,080
but there's some work that has been

2511
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:57,420
happening over at GitHub so it's just

2512
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:59,880
kind of a Call of our actions of a call

2513
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,159
for action on if you want to be part of

2514
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:04,679
this effort as well so you can involve

2515
01:45:04,679 --> 01:45:07,739
yourself on it or if you have any other

2516
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:10,139
ideas or what should be part of this

2517
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:13,020
work you can give us also a feedback so

2518
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:14,639
this is a draft that we have been

2519
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,159
putting together that was born from the

2520
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:20,880
Las ietf ITF 114 we had an invited from

2521
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,440
Sita

2522
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:25,679
um Lana ramij who gave a presentation

2523
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:28,739
about how digital tools and different

2524
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:30,960
protocols and different technology is

2525
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,639
used to enhance intimate partner

2526
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,560
violence and in this case we think about

2527
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,659
intimate partner balance of any kind of

2528
01:45:36,659 --> 01:45:39,659
balance that is executed with a partner

2529
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:41,760
but also someone you have a intimate

2530
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,440
relationship with it could be a

2531
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,659
caregiver it could be your parents it

2532
01:45:45,659 --> 01:45:47,340
could be someone else it doesn't have to

2533
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,679
be always a romantic or sexual

2534
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:51,300
relationships

2535
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:53,040
um so basically we because of that

2536
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,960
presentation we decided to create a

2537
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,480
document that tries to provide the

2538
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,639
standards with recommendations that that

2539
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:01,320
if they are put in certain kind of

2540
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,780
protocols or systems or any kind of

2541
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:06,300
technology that they are describing what

2542
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,219
kind of implications can that technology

2543
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:11,820
have into enhance abuse in the cases of

2544
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:14,040
domestic abuse or more broadly in the

2545
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,500
case of intimate partner violence so we

2546
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,420
put together already a kind of a

2547
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,280
structure of a draft there's already

2548
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,520
some definitions so for example what is

2549
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,300
technology-based intimate partner

2550
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,060
balance what kind of attackers exist in

2551
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,500
this place

2552
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,540
um the specific abuse technology that

2553
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,340
happens in these cases some

2554
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,199
recommendations to protocol designers

2555
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:35,520
and we also added security

2556
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,560
recommendations in case

2557
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,960
um there's some from security that has

2558
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,820
to be taken into account

2559
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:44,340
so if you are very interested in this

2560
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:47,219
work uh please join us in the GitHub or

2561
01:46:47,219 --> 01:46:49,139
in the mailing list if you think this

2562
01:46:49,139 --> 01:46:50,699
all sounds reasonable and this is

2563
01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:52,739
structure sounds reasonable also let us

2564
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:54,840
know if you want anything else also to

2565
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,239
be added let us know and if you want to

2566
01:46:57,239 --> 01:46:59,940
participate actively this draft also let

2567
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:00,900
us know

2568
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,300
and yep just without a quick update on

2569
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,139
that thank you

2570
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:07,980
because this is new work I do actually

2571
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,440
want to open the queue or invite folks

2572
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:13,080
to get into the open queue for any

2573
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,520
questions about this

2574
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,380
um for folks maybe who didn't come or

2575
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:19,860
didn't watch the 114 session you should

2576
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:22,800
it's a fantastic presentation and so

2577
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,360
it's really wonderful to see it's really

2578
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,060
wonderful when we have speakers come

2579
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:29,520
and then those speakers Inspire work

2580
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,619
that's actually the ideal case it

2581
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:32,699
doesn't always happen that's all right

2582
01:47:32,699 --> 01:47:34,320
but

2583
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,000
go ahead Khan good to see you in the

2584
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,639
queue hi uh so just one quick question

2585
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:41,219
for clarification first uh this draft

2586
01:47:41,219 --> 01:47:43,320
has not yet been submitted right it's in

2587
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:46,560
progress no it's a still in progress

2588
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,239
um we do have the first initial

2589
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,040
structure on some texts and potentially

2590
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,619
in the next weeks we

2591
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:57,320
mix with tracker yeah okay great thanks

2592
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,560
all right awesome thank you Sophia okay

2593
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,619
thank you yeah thanks so much so we have

2594
01:48:07,619 --> 01:48:09,420
oh yeah go ahead Colin uh I'll come back

2595
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:11,100
I was expecting more people to comment

2596
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:12,960
on that

2597
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,480
um so yeah uh Colin Perkins uh I think

2598
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:17,580
this is a really important topic um

2599
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,320
obviously I haven't read the draft since

2600
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,780
it's not yet been submitted but uh I I

2601
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,400
would certainly encourage work in this

2602
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,080
space

2603
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,820
I'm really glad to hear that

2604
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,440
thank you

2605
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:30,060
so I'm I'm not going to pull up the

2606
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:32,280
chair slides again but on our agenda we

2607
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:35,340
have a short amount of time for

2608
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:36,659
um cross-pollination from another

2609
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:39,540
working group in the ITF um Adrian if

2610
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:42,060
you're here you've put yourself in the

2611
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:45,540
aob on gnat oh good you're remote

2612
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,520
wonderful so you can also load your

2613
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,080
slides or I can load them and pass them

2614
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:50,659
to you whichever you prefer

2615
01:48:50,659 --> 01:48:54,659
uh I can uh you can hear me right uh yes

2616
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:56,940
we can I can do the slides

2617
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:59,659
fantastic

2618
01:49:00,119 --> 01:49:02,239
um

2619
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,678
can you see them

2620
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:11,780
not yet but sometimes it takes a minute

2621
01:49:16,199 --> 01:49:19,679
oh wait I have uh

2622
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,440
uh

2623
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,420
it's fine if you want to share your

2624
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:27,239
screen but it might also be faster if

2625
01:49:27,239 --> 01:49:29,820
you just share the slide I don't know I

2626
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:33,960
cry uh okay let me uh

2627
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:37,380
you can uh do the slides because uh

2628
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,699
Chrome is asking me to change

2629
01:49:38,699 --> 01:49:41,960
permissions Etc

2630
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:53,940
okay uh so I

2631
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:55,080
um

2632
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,400
so

2633
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,679
um how you can go to

2634
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:01,920
um uh so yes uh I'm involved in the

2635
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,320
ganap grant negotiation authorization

2636
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,020
protocol uh which is a successor to

2637
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:11,460
oauth uh the editors uh were uh you know

2638
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:14,820
editors and principals in uh much of the

2639
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:19,739
oauth and Uma uh protocol work

2640
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:22,980
um this slide uh and I'm going to go

2641
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:25,080
pretty quickly because I wanted

2642
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,119
very interested in feedback from the

2643
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:32,420
group so there's only uh five slides but

2644
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:37,679
anyway so uh this gets an authorization

2645
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:41,520
protocol has privacy issues of course uh

2646
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,320
that are significant in the next slide

2647
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:46,320
I'll talk about that but I am trying to

2648
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,719
and I've been invited to introduce a

2649
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:52,739
human rights consideration into the uh

2650
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:56,040
into the document for gnap

2651
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,440
um where uh the issue that difference

2652
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,900
from privacy is that it doesn't consider

2653
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,940
delegation it ignores the power

2654
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:06,060
asymmetry of the participants in the

2655
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:10,679
protocol and the hrpc force Association

2656
01:51:10,679 --> 01:51:14,340
uh perspective is directly applicable

2657
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,560
here

2658
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:17,159
so

2659
01:51:17,159 --> 01:51:20,639
um what I'm trying to do is convince uh

2660
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,840
the work group the gnap work group that

2661
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,980
unrestricted delegation to the

2662
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:29,600
authorization uh uh unrestricted as

2663
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,360
selection by the subject by the resource

2664
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:36,239
owner should be a must or should next

2665
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:38,780
slide please

2666
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,760
okay so uh just uh a quick review about

2667
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:54,659
what gun app is about uh it specifies an

2668
01:51:54,659 --> 01:51:56,639
authorization server that processes

2669
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,480
requests from a requesting party uh and

2670
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,940
provides it's a token Factory what they

2671
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:05,760
call and provides access tokens

2672
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,699
authorizations to access a resource

2673
01:52:08,699 --> 01:52:12,600
server this is a list of the Privacy

2674
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,179
interests that all meet at the

2675
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:18,020
authorization server and in particular

2676
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:21,119
what I'm concerned about here is to

2677
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:25,280
avoid lock-in to the resource server

2678
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:29,940
business to avoid the ability to have

2679
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:32,580
policy surveillance uh the resource

2680
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:35,460
owner's policy should stay either

2681
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:38,239
entirely to themselves or to our

2682
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:40,880
surrogate a delegate that they choose

2683
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,219
and to avoid the opportunity for traffic

2684
01:52:44,219 --> 01:52:48,239
analysis uh by the uh buy and

2685
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:51,119
authorization server processing request

2686
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:53,760
that where that authorization server

2687
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,060
wasn't selected by the resource owner

2688
01:52:57,060 --> 01:53:00,380
next slide please

2689
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:08,400
um and uh I uh the last ITF uh I was

2690
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,699
asked to provide a PR

2691
01:53:10,699 --> 01:53:13,739
uh there's a bunch of discussion after

2692
01:53:13,739 --> 01:53:15,840
that uh it's a human rights

2693
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:19,020
considerations PR I proposed three

2694
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,480
mitigations uh

2695
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:25,560
but the issue is technically all three

2696
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:29,639
of them uh are possible uh the issue is

2697
01:53:29,639 --> 01:53:32,219
whether these must be the human rights

2698
01:53:32,219 --> 01:53:34,440
issue as I frame it whether it should be

2699
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:37,199
a must or should rather than voluntary

2700
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:41,239
uh next slide please the last one

2701
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:46,380
so uh the call to action uh for hrpc and

2702
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:50,100
ganap is what you see on this slide

2703
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,580
first of all I'm not familiar with a lot

2704
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:56,760
of any much of the work in ietf but it

2705
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,980
seems to me like an app is the best

2706
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:01,500
example for the concerns that are being

2707
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:05,400
discussed in hrpc at this time and I'm

2708
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,679
curious if there are any other examples

2709
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,320
that might be considered as good uh in

2710
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,239
recent memory

2711
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:14,880
um yesterday at this time there was a

2712
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,520
discussion uh which there's a link

2713
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,980
directly to about 15 minutes worth of 20

2714
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:22,020
minutes worth of discussion in the ganap

2715
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:25,739
work group what's interesting here is

2716
01:54:25,739 --> 01:54:29,340
that the various commenters and editors

2717
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:32,400
and chairs as individuals not

2718
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,980
necessarily uh officially basically

2719
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:38,460
pointed out that uh agreed that

2720
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:41,639
hyperscale platforms are an unintended

2721
01:54:41,639 --> 01:54:45,000
concert sequence of the way oauth links

2722
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,860
the authorization server and the

2723
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,260
resource server

2724
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:51,659
they discussion of the fact that

2725
01:54:51,659 --> 01:54:55,739
regulatory capture is a risk and I think

2726
01:54:55,739 --> 01:54:58,320
people in this audience understand all

2727
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,719
about that and

2728
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:04,380
um they mention uh how ganap is intended

2729
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:06,000
to work with these standardized

2730
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,280
verifiable credentials and decentralized

2731
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:11,840
identifiers that are coming out of

2732
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,560
uh w3c and the Linux Foundation as data

2733
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,340
models but standardizing these uh data

2734
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:21,440
models

2735
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,940
has a huge potential for Mass

2736
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:25,699
surveillance

2737
01:55:25,699 --> 01:55:29,400
now that didn't exist before with less

2738
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,619
standardized or of course analog

2739
01:55:31,619 --> 01:55:34,219
physical credentials

2740
01:55:34,219 --> 01:55:38,580
so uh my claim is that forced

2741
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:41,040
association with hyperscale platforms is

2742
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,020
not not no longer an unintended

2743
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:47,219
consequence as it was with uh oauth uh

2744
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:51,260
and uh therefore it has to be dealt with

2745
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:55,860
uh in the nap by uh making uh

2746
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:58,679
hands delegation a must or should thank

2747
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:00,659
you

2748
01:56:00,659 --> 01:56:02,699
thank you and thank you for bringing

2749
01:56:02,699 --> 01:56:06,960
this work in to hlpc I know that um gnap

2750
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,179
or gnap met yesterday and I don't know

2751
01:56:09,179 --> 01:56:11,820
if there was also a parallel discussion

2752
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:16,260
in the working group about uh this issue

2753
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:18,719
I I myself was unable to go because I

2754
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:20,520
had a conflict can you just give us an

2755
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,320
indication of how that conversation went

2756
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,540
yesterday or whether it did

2757
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:27,420
uh well I can do better than that one of

2758
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:31,560
the editors uh Fabian uh has agreed to

2759
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,920
and he's on the Queue so thank you I yes

2760
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:38,340
thanks yeah welcome well hello everyone

2761
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:41,639
uh thanks thanks for this Adrian it's a

2762
01:56:41,639 --> 01:56:44,219
very interesting work uh just to say

2763
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:46,920
that I'm one of the creditors of nap uh

2764
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:49,920
we are taking this work very seriously

2765
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,739
um it's just as was discussed earlier in

2766
01:56:52,739 --> 01:56:56,280
one of your previous comments uh we are

2767
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,199
quite aware that we need to do security

2768
01:56:58,199 --> 01:57:00,659
analysis where we also need to do

2769
01:57:00,659 --> 01:57:03,179
privacy analysis and we are putting

2770
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:06,239
measures in place and for us it's it's

2771
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,460
kind of something that's new for us to

2772
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:09,920
actually

2773
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,699
put put measures in place against

2774
01:57:13,699 --> 01:57:17,820
human rights uh consequences so that's

2775
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:19,739
at least something where I think we

2776
01:57:19,739 --> 01:57:21,480
would need some some additional support

2777
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,340
and I think that's

2778
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:25,739
kind of the message from Adrian and we

2779
01:57:25,739 --> 01:57:27,780
we'd like to thank him for that and

2780
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:29,940
yesterday it was it was discussed in the

2781
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,920
group and actually it was one of the

2782
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,619
main points where a debate was was quite

2783
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:35,699
open

2784
01:57:35,699 --> 01:57:37,980
um the main problem we have is is really

2785
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:41,699
to find actual technical ways to to do

2786
01:57:41,699 --> 01:57:45,000
that in in practice and so that's what

2787
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,920
we're working on so thank you very much

2788
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:51,719
foreign

2789
01:57:51,719 --> 01:57:53,880
thanks for that overview I suggest

2790
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,460
because we've run out of time that

2791
01:57:56,460 --> 01:58:00,179
um you engage both in the hrpc list and

2792
01:58:00,179 --> 01:58:02,280
asking for folks from this group to

2793
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,500
potentially engage in gnap

2794
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,599
um directly and

2795
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:08,400
um talk about that there although

2796
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,400
because this is maybe a Cross Research

2797
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,980
group cross working group topic

2798
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:16,020
um I would encourage folks to try to CC

2799
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:17,340
both lists

2800
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,380
um as the conversation progresses but I

2801
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:20,699
don't think we can get into it too much

2802
01:58:20,699 --> 01:58:22,980
more now although I will wait just a

2803
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:24,300
moment in case there are folks in the

2804
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:25,440
room

2805
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,719
um who've not yet signaled they want to

2806
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,380
be in the queue

2807
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:33,960
all right again uh thanks yeah Colin

2808
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:36,300
please always it's Friday I didn't move

2809
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,099
that quickly

2810
01:58:38,099 --> 01:58:41,400
um uh Colin Perkins uh so I I know

2811
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:42,960
absolutely nothing about the map other

2812
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:45,119
than reading the draft abstract in the

2813
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,400
last sort of 30 seconds or so

2814
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,320
um from what you've been saying that

2815
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:50,699
there's clearly things that that are

2816
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:52,619
worth discussing with this group

2817
01:58:52,619 --> 01:58:54,420
um I think one of the challenges is

2818
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,520
perhaps going to be uh connecting the

2819
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,679
two sets of people with very very

2820
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:01,619
different uh expertise

2821
01:59:01,619 --> 01:59:04,080
um and so uh I think uh you know as

2822
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,119
Mallory says posting to the lists is is

2823
01:59:06,119 --> 01:59:08,460
a good way forward it may also be useful

2824
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:09,480
to

2825
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:11,880
make some direct connections and set up

2826
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:14,040
some small groups to discuss to avoid

2827
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,139
the two the two sets of people with such

2828
01:59:16,139 --> 01:59:17,820
different backgrounds talking past each

2829
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:20,000
other

2830
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,560
so just a plea on the mic and to the

2831
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,420
group if you are interested in this

2832
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:26,580
you've engaged in hrpc you're familiar

2833
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:27,719
with

2834
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:29,639
um reviewing documents if you can just

2835
01:59:29,639 --> 01:59:32,040
indicate to me

2836
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,199
um at some point or call an event that

2837
01:59:34,199 --> 01:59:36,659
you want to engage in this be really

2838
01:59:36,659 --> 01:59:38,760
grateful for your help and thanks again

2839
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:41,340
to the folks uh who brought this both

2840
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:44,280
Adrian and Fabian for coming on Mike

2841
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:46,619
um I will just

2842
01:59:46,619 --> 01:59:48,420
so just to stop this particular

2843
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:51,780
discussion and tap very quickly to the

2844
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:53,040
last

2845
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:56,360
um of my slides

2846
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:59,520
there's been some suggestions

2847
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,400
um also coming from me frankly that

2848
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,139
um perhaps we could consider a slight

2849
02:00:04,139 --> 02:00:06,960
recharter I will also note that we um

2850
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,239
the research group was recently reviewed

2851
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:11,940
by the IAB and

2852
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:14,060
um that's a process that happens

2853
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:16,739
occasionally and I I myself have gone

2854
02:00:16,739 --> 02:00:18,179
through two

2855
02:00:18,179 --> 02:00:20,400
um two of those

2856
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:23,400
um reviews and it's just maybe a good

2857
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,980
time to reflect so I've had some I've

2858
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:27,599
had some of my own thoughts on what a

2859
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,699
recharter might look like I was hoping

2860
02:00:29,699 --> 02:00:32,159
to go through them with you in this

2861
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:34,920
meeting but there's not really much time

2862
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,219
so again like would just say maybe this

2863
02:00:38,219 --> 02:00:39,719
is a this is definitely a conversation

2864
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:41,699
we'll take to the list

2865
02:00:41,699 --> 02:00:42,300
um

2866
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:45,179
and we'll welcome your feedback in that

2867
02:00:45,179 --> 02:00:48,119
list discussion we can also maybe make

2868
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:50,099
sure to allocate more time to this at

2869
02:00:50,099 --> 02:00:52,619
the 116 meeting in Yokohama since you're

2870
02:00:52,619 --> 02:00:54,780
not able to totally read it right now of

2871
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:56,520
course I understand

2872
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:59,940
um but I think the goal would just be to

2873
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:02,280
take on some of the feedback that was

2874
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,320
delivered here today even about our

2875
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:05,639
ability to do

2876
02:01:05,639 --> 02:01:07,619
um reviews

2877
02:01:07,619 --> 02:01:10,679
um bring others along into this work

2878
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:13,020
mainstream it a bit more in the rest of

2879
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:15,000
the community and also be able to take

2880
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,580
on a bit maybe what more we're thinking

2881
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,619
in terms of policy discussions because

2882
02:01:19,619 --> 02:01:21,719
it's not a word that we typically use or

2883
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:23,880
it's not even present in the charter as

2884
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,980
currently but certainly something that

2885
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:28,560
we in fact are

2886
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:31,500
um are doing so to to make that and

2887
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,060
expose that make it more explicit and

2888
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:34,199
expose that

2889
02:01:34,199 --> 02:01:35,699
um I think might be actually be a useful

2890
02:01:35,699 --> 02:01:37,860
exercise those are just my personal

2891
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:39,780
thoughts as the chair

2892
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:43,560
um but Sophia and I will do our best to

2893
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,239
facilitate a conversation on the list

2894
02:01:45,239 --> 02:01:47,580
and then at the next meeting so I

2895
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:49,679
apologize that we ran out of time I

2896
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:51,179
really want to appreciate our speakers I

2897
02:01:51,179 --> 02:01:52,980
think it was worthwhile taking the time

2898
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:55,860
to hear them all out and especially just

2899
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,480
to take us back to the beginning I think

2900
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,599
it was really useful to have Tara talk

2901
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:03,300
about a lot of situation because you can

2902
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:06,659
turn on CNN and see it in the cycle

2903
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:08,940
um and it's just no knowing that there

2904
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:10,500
is actually a touchstone in our

2905
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,780
community to Allah and his case and it's

2906
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:14,639
not just an abstract human rights abuse

2907
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:15,480
case

2908
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:19,199
I hope has moved you as much as it um

2909
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,360
has been moving me to

2910
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,739
read about the situation all right

2911
02:02:22,739 --> 02:02:24,840
thanks everybody

2912
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,860
we're going to close now

2913
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:58,580
thank you

2914
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:05,540
very much
