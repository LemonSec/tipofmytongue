27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,600
to adopt after this meeting and then

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,759

model

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,060
there's been some progress recently

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,820
uh we need to finalize Shepherd right up

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,979
for KB registry

36
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,679
the outer

37
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,860
EVP and flood reduction is still in

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,000
progress

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Ive working on it we've got a new

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,080
individual draft on Leaf rings

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,540
and reef desire multicast is still on

42
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,360
kind of Border we do plan to work on the

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,060
doctor we update the chapter

44
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,260

00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,440
head uh just gonna provide an update on

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,140
how the rift spec is progressing as well

51
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,620
as several others following this next

52
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,160
slide please

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,400
uh so versions you know the draft was

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,580
pushed a couple of weeks after it f-114

55
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,700
following the most recent round of uh ad

56
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,480
review some of what I mentioned here it

57
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,700
was mentioned there but you know some of

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,920
the pairs are beating so overall the

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,260
document continuing to improve I won't

60
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,239
mention every detail but here's kind of

61
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,739
a rough outline of what we've been

62
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,599
working on so

63
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,459
um you know as the documents of all the

64
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,959
couple of Concepts need to be clarified

65
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,780
in text just you know as an example uh

66
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,840
how ties are serialized on wire you know

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,060
a couple of other readability components

68
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,500
like uh

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,540
adding pointers to the Reader's Digest

70
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,180
for like some security Concepts

71
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,080
um

72
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,080
beyond that uh svgs and ASCII art now

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,840
align properly and uh what I mean by

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,159
that is they basically tell the same

75
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,480
story and provide the same value

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,140
regardless of the uh format of the draft

77
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,180
that you're reading and kind of as as

78
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,860
was intended

79
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,420
um it's kind of worth noting we got some

80
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,180
pretty good feedback from

81
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,640
external readers as well so it's it's

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,780
good to know that those are actually

83
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,579
helping

84
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,680
um other SVG optimizations kind of

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,660
helped us get around a lot of the ietf

86
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,100
tooling challenges

87
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,880
um

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,860
you know there's a fair bit of work that

89
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,080
went into them uh you know I think they

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
provide a lot of value uh especially for

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the more complex topologies but uh it

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
was it's worth noting that it was it's

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,419
pretty difficult to actually get them to

94
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,100
work within the confines of the existing

95
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,540
ITF tools

96
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,100
um so it's something I'm following up

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,060
with

98
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,360
um some of the tooling folks and

99
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,220
you know a couple other avenues I

100
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,960
digress

101
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,820
um updates the Ianna consideration

102
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,620
section we had to actually push the new

103
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,160
version of the uh Fritz schema as well

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
as a couple of little uh

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
little phrasing fixes for for what

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
Ayanna had mentioned to us

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,440
um next slide please

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,900
and you know and then the usual kind of

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,580
you know editorial changes grammar

110
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,340
spelling flow references Etc and then

111
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,540
you know last but not least some

112
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,639
improved kind of uh inclusion diversity

113
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,040
sort language

114
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,639
um next slide

115
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,740
and as for what's next uh we're

116
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,139
continuing to work with Alvaro and AD

117
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,520
and you know we'll keep applying as soon

118
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,500
as we can and kind of keep keep

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,680
everything moving forward uh I also owe

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,539
avaro and and the chairs and the

121
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,120
shepherd uh brief thread to kind of

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,860
rework The Shepherd of you so we can get

123
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,419
myself named uh

124
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,479
we're officially tied in as a co-author

125
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,740
um

126
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,380
but no that's it next slide comments

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,560
questions concerns

128
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,220
foreign

129
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,780
okay

130
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,960
um brief update on the KV registry next

131
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,440
slide please

132
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,759
I think Jeff recovered a lot of this

133
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,639
um but essentially we've got the you

134
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,440
know there's nothing terribly exciting

135
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,900
in new versions it's mostly

136
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,919
edits due to Shepherd review things like

137
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,400
uh you know references boilerplate Etc

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,818
uh next slide

139
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,120
and kind of Beyond you know just uh

140
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
waiting for the write-up Ayanna actually

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
reached out a couple of days ago and

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,280
pointed out that you know we need to

143
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,740
specify a couple of ambiguous things

144
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,120
basically

145
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,580
because

146
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,080
uh specify upper bounds for some of the

147
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,300
values and things like that so we'll get

148
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,280
that adjusted you know along with the

149
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,160
shepherd feedback in the next version

150
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,819
next slide

151
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,860
and that's it uh questions

152
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,860
okay

153
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,780
okay last but not least uh for me um so

154
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,160
flood reflection got some updates as

155
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,199
well this time

156
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,220
um next slide please

157
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,180
okay

158
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,639
um basically we've added a role for

159
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,680
spine nodes which is just a way of

160
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,919
saying a way to specify spines as a

161
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,300
specific entity

162
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,979
um or you know non-flood reflector

163
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,099
client or non-flood reflector nodes uh

164
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,220
participating in Auto FR so this lets us

165
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,319
you know advertise some kind of generic

166
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,639
State about the spine that might be

167
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,620
important to the overall picture of the

168
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,259
flood reflection topology and you know

169
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,179
beyond that it it kind of lays the

170
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,740
groundwork or you know adds the

171
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,419
capability for any spine specific

172
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,059
variable derivation uh should it be

173
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,380
needed in the future

174
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,659
uh we added a bit more

175
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,680
to the um Telemetry key value ties

176
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,360
um so basically we can now uh carry and

177
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
describe State uh for you know kind of

178
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,940
the regular or internal level one Isis

179
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,860
adjacency

180
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,779
um within the fabric next slide

181
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,000
uh slightly more detailed view so

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,800
basically

183
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,260
the items in bold are what's new

184
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,720
um so it's kind of as an example if we

185
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,339
were advertising

186
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,500
um KVs from a flood reflector client you

187
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,540
know a leaf node at the top of the

188
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,640
fabric we'd be able to see the state of

189
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
you know functional versus total level

190
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,399
two flood reflector adjacencies to the

191
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,740
actual flood reflectors themselves

192
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,240
um functional versus total level one

193
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,279
shortcuts between Leaf nodes for any

194
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,380
deployments that uh that leverage them

195
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,600
and then you know as I mentioned the new

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,779
one uh you know functional versus total

197
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,920
level one you know air quotes regular

198
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,959
Isis adjacencies that describe more of

199
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,380
the uh underlying Isis topology so

200
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,760
you know the operator really benefits

201
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,640
and that they can see the entire fabric

202
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,580
from the leaf and spine's point of view

203
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,820
but all from you know a single top node

204
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,839
next slide

205
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,459
some more SVG stuff

206
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,779
um for this one so the operational

207
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:07,980
section

208
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,980
had an SVG that sort of described how

209
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,440
the rift underlay you know the base Isis

210
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,940
topology and then the flood reflection

211
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,519
topology all fit together

212
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,339
um depending on location in the fabric

213
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,980
uh previously we only had it working in

214
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,500
the pdf version but kind of similar to

215
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,839
the base spec got things uh

216
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,360
compliant with the uh

217
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,980
draft upload tool and things like that

218
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,080
so now it's in the HTML version so I

219
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
think it keeps things kind of

220
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,680
nice and crisp

221
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,279
um

222
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,180
that slide

223
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,380
so Jeffrey mentioned this too

224
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,700
um

225
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,100
I know adoptions waiting on the

226
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,079
retardering discussion

227
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,040
um

228
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,660
so you know hoping to see things

229
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,060
progress on that front and as for future

230
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,640
updates uh right now we've there's more

231
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,980
KV stuff slated for the next version and

232
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,000
then

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
um we're still kind of

234
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,839
noodling around with a multi-plane flood

235
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,180
reflection stuff uh

236
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,459
and that's it for the for now that's it

237
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,279
for me any questions about Auto fr

238
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,279
o

239
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,640
I should have one question uh

240
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,959
so was this presented in the LSR at all

241
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,779
because my understanding is that this

242
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,959
will be used for ISS flattery

243
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,899
reduction right so what do the what does

244
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,260
Sr think of this

245
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,180
um the questions that kind of came up

246
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,640
there it was presented um I forget which

247
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,300
meeting it was a couple meetings ago

248
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,140
um basically their only question or

249
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,079
concern was does it overlap with any of

250
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
the other working groups like The Auto

251
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,220
configuration stuff for IDR Etc

252
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,240
um and

253
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,839
uh it doesn't right we're not

254
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,660
actually modifying this doesn't actually

255
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,300
modify Isis it we're just using a rift

256
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,800
to kind of uh

257
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,620
leverage some of the the we're

258
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,000
leveraging risk distributed nature to

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,040
basically build the configurations and

260
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,019
you know determine what things are where

261
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,459
so

262
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,319
um no actual Conflict for us

263
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,160
so if Isis implementation wants to make

264
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,660
use of this

265
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,500
do they need any uh specification in LSR

266
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,800
or not or do they need to interrupt

267
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,959
between other routers

268
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,720
things like that so for there is an LSR

269
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,000
spec for flood reflection itself

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,519
um this is just the auto configuration

271
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,680
portion so

272
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,779
um it depends how you want to do it

273
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:49,620
um if they don't need the auto

274
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,260
configuration pieces of it then they

275
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,820
don't need it um if they do and they

276
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,380
want to run risks then

277
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,980
yeah they you know follow this spec and

278
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,380
you know along with the lsr1 and you get

279
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,360
both uh looks like Tony wants to add

280
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
something

281
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,979
foreign

282
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,200
so uh we do not need any LSR specs uh if

283
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,120
you have this thing implemented with

284
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,620
Isis

285
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,500
um

286
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,959
then the only

287
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,940
interaction surface is really pulling

288
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,000
out the analytics right which is always

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
very vendor specific

290
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,260
um so the Isis has to expose with

291
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,060
already does in some form of fashion

292
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,760
right worst case you do CLI scraping if

293
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,260
you want to provide the analytics you

294
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,560
need the information out of Isis but the

295
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,320
analytics is completely optional so no

296
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,019
there is no

297
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,519
implications in terms of you know

298
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,260
scaling or implementation or

299
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,839
specification we need to extend here

300
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,519
um I mean so far nobody came up with any

301
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,680
ideas that would this thing would do

302
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,540
something you know stunning on Isis that

303
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,980
we have to add so no

304
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,459
is this applicable to ospf at all

305
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,180
20p again yeah well so I mean this idea

306
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,800
is hanging for a while

307
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,839
and it's a

308
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,480
very short road to fame and riches if

309
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,680
you're right you know flood reflection

310
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,899
for SPF which is pretty much a straight

311
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,480
knock off of a higher size stuff but

312
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,740
there's just simply not enough customer

313
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,480
demand those SPF networks are not big

314
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
enough and people aren't used that way

315
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,820
so it will be effort wasted yeah you

316
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,339
could add flavors to this stuff for

317
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,779
example

318
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,820
where you run configure the flood

319
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,300
reflection being L2 Isis and underneath

320
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,120
have OSP fsl1 which would work just as

321
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,399
fine but there's simply there's no

322
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,899
customer demand for it for the moment

323
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,519
and probably after every Charter and

324
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,399
decide whether we

325
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,860
proceed with this work as a courtesy we

326
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,540
will share it with the Lesser and ask

327
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,439
for the reactions

328
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,540
yeah and and for for what it's worth I I

329
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,560
have a

330
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,839
we'll say more detailed presentation

331
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,300
that kind of uh addresses some of that

332
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,399
stuff if if that needs to happen with

333
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,720
LSR again

334
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,740
so no problem

335
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,320
so probably will Target this in a San

336
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,500
Francisco time frame and

337
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,660
maybe presentational sir

338
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,319
yeah okay

339
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,860
um okay so Jordan uh you're going to

340
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,800
provide a quick update on other uvpn as

341
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,339
well right no slides but uh quick update

342
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,639
I think uh

343
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,680
there wasn't any actual drop that they

344
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,839
just go around and there is some stuff

345
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,000
slated for the next one it's uh Auto

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,519
frapping to just kind of take the take

347
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,480
priority

348
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,360
um there's still some uh multiplane and

349
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,579
data center interconnect Gateway stuff

350
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,360
that we're working as well as you know

351
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,579
you know as as the thing continuously

352
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,500
svgs and making the operational section

353
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,699
A little

354
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,600
a little bit cleaner um so

355
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,380
that's for next time

356
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,480
uh 20p again to fill in a little bit

357
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,779
more detail so basically

358
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,600
uh the as far as I remember the schema

359
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,820
version and coding six added something

360
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,759
what where we know that we needed in

361
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,980
games in case of multiplying fabric to

362
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,279
run a proper Auto VPN Auto FR election

363
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,920
so we can actually distribute the FRS or

364
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,980
the RRS across multiple planes simply

365
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,420
for uh what you call it uh resiliency

366
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,540
reasons and but the election in itself

367
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,339
has not been modified yet the algorithm

368
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,800
to take that into account that's pretty

369
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,799
much the the thing outstanding there is

370
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,359
a little bit of work so the schema

371
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,980
everything is here in coding it's just

372
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,720
you know I need to add this little bit

373
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,699
of to the algorithm we will talk it

374
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,079
through we know how it would work but

375
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,540
it's just right now it is not taking the

376
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,959
plane into consideration yet because the

377
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,339
plane itself uh adds a little bit to

378
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,199
what Rift has to advertise so the scheme

379
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,760
elements are here they're optional but

380
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,919
if you run a multi-plane implementation

381
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,440
you would have to advertise the stuff on

382
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,500
the Note uh tie so other people can

383
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,880
figure out which plane they are in and

384
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,980
you know who what is the plane ID and

385
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,240
there are multiple planes and then you

386
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,740
have to take it into election

387
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,340
yeah so you would also need to enforce

388
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,400
at least one instance per plane right

389
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,080
you're right so the algorithm will do

390
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,820
take care of it right so it will

391
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,520
basically just like we have

392
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,380
um preference and we have then we have

393
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,380
system ID ordering we will basically the

394
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,820
same way we would take the highest

395
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,919
system ID lower system ID second highest

396
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,200
system ID second lowest will have the

397
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,240
plane ID in front of the plane ID is

398
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,980
basically nothing else but the highest

399
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,820
system ID within a plane and that's why

400
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,440
everybody in a plane starts to advertise

401
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,000
those are all the guys in the planes and

402
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,380
you know okay the eye with this higher

403
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,600
system ID is actually the plane ID and

404
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,100
then the other guys who don't

405
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,480
necessarily see all the guys in the

406
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,539
plane know what is the plane ID and

407
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,880
based having all the plane IDs that can

408
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,720
actually

409
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,840
running consistent election where the

410
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,660
FRS or RRS will be basically spread

411
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,059
across the planes right so first you

412
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,679
take the plane into consideration they

413
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,240
continue to take a priority within the

414
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,640
plane and then you go the high ID low ID

415
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,440
so if one crashes you don't get

416
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,059
immediately you know like flip over so

417
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,799
you don't get so you basically get for

418
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,740
free bdr Behavior you know SPF that was

419
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,240
a lot of acronyms I hope somebody could

420
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
follow that

421
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,620
uh

422
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,860
I think we're down to the last one yeah

423
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,000
so Cindy you have 40 minutes

424
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,900
hello do you hear me

425
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,820
yeah

426
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,700
okay thank you a lot of time

427
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,840
very fortunately

428
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,480
uh hi everyone and I'm sending song from

429
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,780
ZTE this presentation is for uh

430
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,679
supporting leaves without not among the

431
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,179
neighbors connecting to a factory

432
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,660
network using Rift we have called a real

433
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,460
heart number Zone next please

434
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,299
uh though the draft has been presented

435
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,600
before but I let me explain it again and

436
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,179
in case somebody listens at the first

437
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,260
time

438
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,340
in the example Metro Network the spine

439
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,860
Leaf topology can be deployed to replace

440
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,919
the traditional topology Rift can be

441
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,039
used as the dynamic routing protocol to

442
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,780
build the network

443
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,020
the access network May connect to the

444
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,960
core Network by lymph nodes by ring or

445
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,480
chain topologic for example everyone

446
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,640
Network next please

447
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,840
this figure is the Leaf part of the

448
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,260
network we know in typical Rift protocol

449
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,380
every leaf node has not found the

450
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,740
connection with Final in case I leave

451
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,380
node lost all the North Bank the

452
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,780
connection and can still access the

453
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,020
network by Southwestern labor lifted but

454
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,740
in this deployment some Leaf nodes never

455
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,220
have Northbound the connection even if

456
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,919
there is the best neighbors haven't not

457
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,020
bounded connection also

458
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,200
looks like they can access the Active

459
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,320
network by the East West connection but

460
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,039
according to the typical Rift protocol

461
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,640
flooding and SPF algorithm the leaves

462
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,900
cannot advertise their prefix not tied

463
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,020
to the network and the leaves cannot

464
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,220
receive the prefix Source type from the

465
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
defaulted route to

466
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,980
for example in this figure there are six

467
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,600
if notes but only L1 L2 and L3 have not

468
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,020
found the connection with spine nodes L4

469
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,159
and L6 can access the network by L1 and

470
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,179
L3 but L5 cannot access the network

471
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,360
because it and its neighbors haven't not

472
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,980
found a connection

473
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,360
next piece

474
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,120
in order to solve the problem the key is

475
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,600
let the leaf node without not found the

476
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,419
connection receive the prefix sort type

477
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,080
from for defaulted World from the East

478
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,960
West neighbors understanding the prefix

479
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,960
not tied to reach to the div node which

480
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,500
has northbounder connection this is a

481
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,200
change for the flooding the leaf node

482
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,480
without Northbound neighbors must

483
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,360
transfer the prefix Source type received

484
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,940
from an Easter with the neighbor to the

485
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,980
other is the best neighbor which also

486
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,580
has no Northbound connection and the

487
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,940
leaf node without not found labors must

488
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,559
transfer prefix not Pi received from a

489
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,720
Easter Western neighbor which has no

490
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,700
Northbound connection to the other

491
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,440
Easter with the neighbor

492
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,780
other

493
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,580
flooding function and the SPF algorithm

494
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,559
are not changed so in this figure L4 and

495
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,480
L6 must transfer the prefix Source type

496
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,500
received from L1 and L3 to L5 we

497
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,059
increase the metric and L4 and L6 must

498
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,360
transfer the prefix North type received

499
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,280
from L5 to L1 and L3 with increase the

500
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,360
metric

501
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,740
and so if I received the prefixes both

502
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,320
type and find the way to access the

503
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,120
network by L4 or L6

504
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,539
L1 and L3 receive the prefix note type

505
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:44,400
and the pushes the title spinal and the

506
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
nodes in other side of the network can

507
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,980
send the flow to L5 and L5 can send the

508
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,220
flow to the other nodes in the network

509
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,100
a new link capability is defined

510
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,059
underneath is if transport it can be set

511
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,299
in line and node type and this

512
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:07,260
capability won't affect the line FSM

513
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,280
next please

514
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,900
and this chapter has been presented in

515
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,380
itf11 and has been discussed in the

516
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,860
mailing list in the update of version

517
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,059
zero one according to the subjection a

518
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,760
suggestion from last meeting we added

519
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,820
the description of external prefix not

520
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,900
type transference and that is the reef

521
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,419
node without not found Neighbors which

522
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,059
supports the leaf transfer capability

523
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:45,720
must transfer the external prefix not

524
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,539
tied received received from and used

525
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,120
with neighbor which has no Nerf boundary

526
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,760
connection to the other is the Western

527
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,260
neighborhood

528
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,440
and so that's all we are looking for

529
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,799
more comments and suggestions I'm not

530
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,460
too much sure if this extension will be

531
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,980
considered in the new Charter but it's

532
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,260
great if working group can consider

533
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,379
about it thank you any comments

534
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,780
hey Cindy Tony p uh Juniper

535
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,120
uh right can we flip back to the

536
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,260
topology picture please

537
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,159
foreign

538
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,080
so

539
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,720
first observation I don't know whether I

540
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,179
made it already last time

541
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,659
um you kind of

542
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,059
generate a corner case of a corner case

543
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:47,039
and solve it because if you don't force

544
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,659
this topology the L notes the beliefs

545
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:53,580
then Rift automatically solves the

546
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,059
problem as it stands today

547
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:59,940
imagine that a low 405lo 6 are not

548
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,520
forced to leave right so the l05 by ztp

549
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,580
will automatically end up a level below

550
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,559
so it will start to look like a sink

551
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,799
below right so it's a very degenerate

552
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,640
Claw lo4 is only single home lo6 is only

553
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,600
single homed and lo5 is dual homed but

554
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,480
based on normal D4 route advertisement

555
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,419
the whole thing will work the rift will

556
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,100
support the stuff today

557
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,140
now if you tell me that you're

558
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,580
interested in the corner corner case

559
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,980
where you force all these notes on being

560
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,260
a leaf

561
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,620
then yes what you're suggesting I have

562
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,380
to think about this new addition through

563
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,260
um whether that can possibly Loop but

564
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,840
what you're suggesting

565
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,600
um will work

566
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
right over the horizontal link support

567
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,500
will basically give you so I think the

568
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,120
stuff that you're extending as the

569
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,320
flooding is already in the spec

570
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,439
um

571
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:08,100
the only thing I would strongly object

572
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,960
is can you flip uh one uh forward with

573
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,520
the procedures please

574
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,760
um all right so

575
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,919
you never

576
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,460
flood on a southbound tie

577
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,700
so if you really want

578
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,220
this prefix South tie transferring

579
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,320
support right nothing wrong with that

580
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,360
but basically what you have to say you

581
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,120
have to take the prefixes you received

582
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
southbound and you have to regenerate

583
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,140
your own southbound tie

584
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,020
otherwise things won't work properly if

585
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,799
you start to propagate

586
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,500
ties southbound ties multiple hops

587
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,679
you will end up in trouble plus it

588
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,299
breaks the whole architecture completely

589
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,779
so

590
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:05,279
one suggestion how you solve it

591
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,559
implementation wise is that you support

592
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,760
the policy or you can take a prefix that

593
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,039
you got from southbound and you

594
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,640
redistribute it into re inside basically

595
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,620
you say okay whatever came

596
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,820
from the north in the South Thai

597
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,080
re-advertise its southbound so it's

598
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,820
basically a prefix redistribution within

599
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,520
the protocol which will work fine

600
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,500
from experience

601
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,900
so to Observation first you're solving a

602
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,299
corner corner case that you kind of call

603
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,240
upon yourself if you if you if you force

604
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,220
those things being leaves

605
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,260
which I don't see a reason for but may

606
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,580
you may have one

607
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,760
and the second one is that you cannot

608
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,820
reflaught the southbound tie you have to

609
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,400
regenerate it because the original

610
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,620
originator has to be one level away

611
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,220
okay otherwise like I said corner corner

612
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,810
case

613
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,080
[Music]

614
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,900
um

615
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,679
okay let's see um because we think every

616
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,500
group to want to be used in in many

617
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,480
deployment uh maybe this honor case will

618
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,320
occur so we think that it may be a use

619
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,000
case for Rift but the SEO side

620
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,960
we use the dtp uh latep function of Rift

621
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,380
we can generate the level automatically

622
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,220
and so some leaves will not be leaves

623
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,940
and it will be spine that's a way to

624
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,700
solve it but we know that in some

625
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,539
Network the the leaves may be not stable

626
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,820
so and in case there is some

627
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,760
breaking or something other

628
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,220
there are something other have happened

629
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,940
maybe and the the

630
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,679
devil will be broken and it will be

631
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,220
generated at the end so that's why we

632
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,360
don't want to use 80 people here

633
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,220
and in our side if we use the new link

634
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,940
capability that can be a strictly

635
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,620
configured in limited nodes so it may

636
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,899
avoid the wrong flooding of the uh the

637
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:31,620
tie that can avoid the looping but it's

638
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,880
just another size for now and maybe in

639
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,940
some cases it will still cause the loop

640
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,919
as your size no

641
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,320
yeah nope uh because the flooding on the

642
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,320
in multi-plane case on the Rings

643
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,620
read the section on the

644
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,799
the flooding procedures or rather the

645
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,960
flooding Scope when you have a ring at

646
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,299
the top of the fabric you try to

647
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,700
introduce exactly the same Flooding at

648
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,140
the bottom of the fabric that's what

649
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,480
you're doing here you're ringing the

650
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,220
bottom of the fabric just like we

651
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,980
ringing in my multi-plane case the top

652
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,620
of the fabric and the same flooding

653
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,779
Scopes will apply that's why I told you

654
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,700
stuff will work but you you cannot

655
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,279
regenerate the South tie so read this

656
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,340
section think through it and

657
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,299
uh

658
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,360
you are not solving any looping problems

659
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,399
the only

660
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,159
valid reason to do what you do here is

661
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,659
to say that I do never want those leaves

662
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,059
to be transits but actually you already

663
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,659
violating it ll6 is a Transit here

664
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,580
and think about the failure of link

665
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,840
between lo1 and lo4 yeah lo5 will become

666
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,640
Transit anyway otherwise you're black

667
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,460
hole ink so

668
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,679
even the corner corner case you think

669
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,720
you're solving you're not solving if you

670
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,000
just leave those things

671
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,480
not being forced to believe you achieve

672
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,460
exactly the same behavior

673
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,919
that you get with all the changes that

674
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,500
you try to introduce additionally here

675
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,899
so I mean brutally speaking I think this

676
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,899
is largely Superfluous it could be done

677
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,299
right at the top of the fabric we had no

678
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,100
choice we had to rank those things and

679
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,620
we had to get the flooding Scopes if you

680
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,840
want to do that yeah okay we just repeat

681
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,120
the extensions for the top of the fabric

682
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,700
rings

683
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,440
um so you can basically read that and

684
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,360
compare with what you try to extend and

685
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,380
you'll find that you're pretty much

686
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,600
doing the same thing

687
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,620
um

688
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,059
but

689
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,840
I really don't see the value

690
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,200
could be done but I don't see the use

691
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,419
case that you ultimately ultimately are

692
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,220
solving

693
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,980
unless you're willing to for example

694
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,820
black hole l04 if lo1 lo4 links dies and

695
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,220
then lo5 really because it behaves like

696
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,020
a leaf and never forwards through it

697
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,880
it's never Transit but then you will

698
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,080
black hole that low forward and

699
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,179
basically you don't have ring resiliency

700
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,520
anymore and you have ring resiliency

701
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,159
anymore if you just leave Rift as it is

702
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,159
you will get it by yourself by itself

703
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,279
okay just you need to so if we keep it

704
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,120
as is we actually logically build seven

705
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,120
stage right hello five is going to have

706
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,779
parent relationship or yeah four and six

707
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:37,080
however on breakage of L1 to L4 you'll

708
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,320
have to re-elect and change well then

709
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,539
you will have

710
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:43,399
lo605lo4

711
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,460
into L5 nl5 and that's how it will work

712
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,799
which is exactly what you can get out of

713
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,360
the ring protection here nothing more

714
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,120
and Rift will solve it for you by yes

715
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,059
behaving counter-intuitively because it

716
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,460
will build a chain downwards but the

717
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,500
forwarding Behavior resiliency will be

718
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,179
the same so I'm trying to understand the

719
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,419
Behavior now L4 is

720
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,359
very very bottom yes so now L5 is very

721
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,820
bottom right at this point in time the

722
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,159
lo5 is very bottom

723
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,659
dual home yeah so when uh link between

724
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,879
L1 and L4 breaks you change the

725
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,399
relationship right well the ztp will

726
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,159
basically the lo5 will look at the

727
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,619
offers it got it will got l06 and l04

728
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,379
lo4 will withdraw it offer lo5 will say

729
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,839
I'm still good I got from lo6

730
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,260
whatever level I'm one below the lo4 or

731
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,179
you realize it has no value offers

732
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,179
because the only valid offer to for for

733
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,560
for level was from l01 the offer is gone

734
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,480
convergence sorry there's no GTP there's

735
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,879
convergence on breakage of the link

736
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,679
no but you also have the ztp because

737
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,560
they have to change levels yeah right so

738
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,960
the ztp it will all run at the same time

739
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,180
right the lo4 will basically start to

740
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,859
change its Level under lo5

741
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,859
the best offer it has right now which

742
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:12,000
level it's at is from lo1 right so

743
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,740
the problem is if you set all these

744
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,119
things to leave they're all at level

745
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,300
zero see what happens so if links break

746
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,359
they yeah that's right so you need all

747
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,400
these special flooding Scopes just like

748
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,380
the top of fabric cannot become lower on

749
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,760
top of fabric that's why we need the

750
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,920
ring flooding so now the zero becomes

751
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,540
like top of fabric you have to do all

752
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,700
the ring flooding which

753
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,339
if we take the top flooding rules Scopes

754
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:36,780
which is kind of what they suggest

755
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,660
here's extension it will work but it's

756
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,240
just overly complicated because Normal

757
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,460
riffs by changing the levels and

758
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,940
ordering those guys will provide you all

759
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,040
the correct forwarding behaviors no the

760
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,140
link breakages here yeah

761
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,619
so that's so that's kind of my point if

762
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,420
you really want to force those guys all

763
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,320
on the leaf and zero okay then you need

764
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,960
this but why why you do that the only

765
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,700
reason would be you don't you don't want

766
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,160
it to ever be a transit for traffic but

767
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,440
then you cannot protect loanlo4 failure

768
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,780
because lo4 has only yellow five as

769
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,540
Transit if lo5 refuses to be Transit you

770
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,520
have no ring protection anymore

771
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,500
right so

772
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,740
I'm like yeah we can do that but I

773
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,619
simply do do not understand why it will

774
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,540
be necessary unless you really want to

775
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,220
prevent those guys being Transit which

776
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,920
breaks the ring protection so that's my

777
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,060
input here

778
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,800
San Diego what do you say

779
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,980
yes I think that dtp is not a good

780
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,460
choice for this

781
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,400
this situation so

782
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,800
I think that we should not use dtp here

783
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,500
but as Tony said uh

784
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,900
configured prefix redistribution may be

785
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,119
considered rich so

786
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,240
um I'm not uh I think much more about it

787
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,300
but I will so I think that if uh if we

788
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,900
think that the new link capability will

789
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,820
broke the algorithm of the drift

790
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,720
fundament fundamention so we we may not

791
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,900
use it but we have found another way to

792
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,079
solve it though it's a corner case but

793
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,859
uh but in my opinion or in our customer

794
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:36,060
they think uh it may be a deployment for

795
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:42,000
a it so so we think this maybe it's a

796
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,520
corner case but it still be needed to be

797
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,140
stored but we can try another way like

798
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,420
Tony site the prefix retribution

799
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,000
first just switch off Leaf flags on L

800
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,119
one two three four five six break links

801
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,800
and see how it behaves and you will see

802
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,160
that you get the ring protection

803
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,160
supported

804
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,940
yeah but during the level change

805
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,880
changing the convergency time may be

806
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,800
considered about it that is a pure

807
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,260
implementation consideration okay so

808
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,420
right if you start to become very

809
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,420
concerned about that and you say I do

810
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,700
not want to run the you know the

811
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,000
election of the level and you think that

812
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,660
will save you convergence

813
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,339
um yes it will because you just have to

814
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,220
disable the next top if you really need

815
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,579
yes so I give you that right I mean

816
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:58,500
frankly the ztp runs within

817
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,480
well-implemented finite State machines

818
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,720
my experience runs within milliseconds

819
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,460
so

820
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,280
at most tens of milliseconds right to

821
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,140
get all the accelerated hellos and Z

822
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,119
because we put the ztp on the hellos and

823
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,920
the hellos get accelerated on failures

824
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,520
my experience is it's you know

825
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,640
I can run on my implementation well on

826
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,040
the 50 Milli the whole thing now if

827
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,780
you're concerned about that and you just

828
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,300
want a fast path to disable what's so

829
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,480
let's say hello1 to lo4 fails and you

830
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,000
just want to kill from lo4 the next stop

831
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,079
but see the problem is

832
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,079
on on the Rings

833
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,180
you have to follow the shortest path

834
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,339
because you will Loop

835
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:47,280
so go look how the the ring flooding on

836
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,260
top works and how the computation is

837
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,900
done because you cannot install now in

838
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,079
in the forwarding table something on lo4

839
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,800
so let's assume it'll default right so

840
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,560
you cannot install in lo4 D4 entry that

841
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,920
has next stop lo1 and lo5 because that

842
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,320
may lead to looping behaviors okay

843
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,320
because you are not on the claw the the

844
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,000
whole you you're not in valley free

845
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,320
routing anymore

846
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,980
the whole Rift trick of being able to

847
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,720
take any path is because it's completely

848
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,359
value free this is not value free this

849
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,660
is flat you can go up and down so if you

850
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,240
basically naively install lo4

851
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,060
default route with l01 and lo5 Next Top

852
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,060
these regarding the distance here

853
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,700
if people start to build weird stuff and

854
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,359
shortcut it okay it will start to Loop

855
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,000
which means that you're forced anyway in

856
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,160
such a scenario to install default on

857
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,339
lo4 that has only next.lo1 which means

858
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,079
if the link fails

859
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,660
you still need to download

860
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,740
into lo4 with the lo5 next top

861
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,760
where okay so you won't be able to

862
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,099
accelerate convergence in the generic

863
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,200
case on this little little thingy that

864
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,540
you show here

865
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,500
depending how you treat the 020503 links

866
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,079
um if you follow Rift today you will not

867
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,700
loop with your extensions I cannot tell

868
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,700
but in the generic case if you start to

869
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,560
introduce this flag you can only install

870
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,660
shortest path because you're not invalid

871
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,980
free routing anymore you're not

872
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,339
guaranteeing that okay so I don't think

873
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,760
you can accelerate convergence either

874
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,500
practically speaking depending on a

875
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,119
million things right you can pre-compute

876
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,640
stuff and accelerate but practically

877
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,640
speaking I don't think

878
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,599
you'll be gaining much

879
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,940
okay so that's that's my input to the

880
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,400
whole thing the Sunday uh so I'm

881
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,079
completely with Tony here look in the

882
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,520
implementation you cannot use faster

883
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,160
hash because uh no endpoint is the

884
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,720
network is a key distance they cannot

885
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,760
have array of next hubs you would have

886
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,380
to compute something like look free

887
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,140
alternative which Rift not suitable for

888
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,740
where L1 would be primary and L5 backup

889
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,140
to switching Hardware otherwise you

890
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,940
still need to invalidate next stop in

891
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,400
rips and re-download the routes which

892
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,540
kind of defeats the point

893
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,359
milliseconds at least

894
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,660
um yes I think from our experience on

895
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,060
the IDP protocol we think that the

896
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,940
protocol converges time will larger than

897
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,520
the uh

898
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,060
backup table or convergence so we think

899
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,480
about the solution but it's great if the

900
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,380
dtp is changing will still consume so

901
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,220
little time so it's great but we have

902
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,760
not tested on it we think we can we can

903
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,740
do more workouts about it

904
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,579
Cindy so I liked it but why don't you

905
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,359
you know implement this I mean that's

906
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,579
not the massive change I I advise you to

907
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:19,859
look at the ring flooding on top so you

908
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,240
verify what you're doing here because

909
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,859
you're changing flooding Scopes which is

910
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,180
cool but it's basically the same problem

911
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,020
so you can Implement a variant of it and

912
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,599
then a run a rift just doing the

913
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,020
election in your case and run this and

914
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,000
see what is the difference I mean you

915
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,680
don't have to bring absolute numbers but

916
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,540
show that in our implementation with 3

917
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,740
we see 3x Improvement and then we chat

918
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,359
but I think you'll be a little bit

919
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,819
disappointed and like I said don't

920
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,680
forget unless you compute Loop free

921
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,980
Alternatives like Jeff said you really

922
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,079
go into igp Loop free Alternatives

923
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,520
that's literally what you're going into

924
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,160
you cannot just naively install the

925
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,260
other one lo5 next stop so you have

926
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,960
somehow either extend the whole Solution

927
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,680
by LFA

928
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,020
Ah that's that's a heavy thing

929
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,819
or

930
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,500
and don't forget because you're flooding

931
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,060
southbound you will not see the topology

932
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,859
so I don't think you can even compute

933
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,560
LFA okay you cannot understand you don't

934
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,680
have the full topology LFA is very very

935
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,440
reliable you know uh reliant on the fact

936
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,660
that you see full topology

937
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,240
so see what happens if you switch a rift

938
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,060
and just let it do the ztp and rebuild

939
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,280
the adjacency reload and what you can

940
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,740
get out of your extension if you lose

941
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,359
the stuff and you just redistribute the

942
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,280
prefixes and you recompute the prefix to

943
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,500
the neighbor without losing adjacency I

944
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,119
will see how much you can get out of it

945
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,579
because right now it's you know

946
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,400
bit handwave you can get your point but

947
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,220
it will I I would be far more interested

948
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,780
in the solution if you show me very

949
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,280
significant you know

950
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,099
uh half order of magnitude gain in terms

951
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,500
of you know failover protection

952
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,760
okay

953
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,240
I can only imagine static configuration

954
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,460
of backup paths but

955
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,560
again it's kind of very implementation

956
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,160
specific

957
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,700
so I think

958
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,339
let's be um don't consider the solution

959
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,640
we just consider the situation is this

960
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,880
situation or the deployment need to be

961
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,839
considered or or this situation makes

962
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,099
sense

963
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,940
uh how do you think about it and despite

964
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,800
of the solution

965
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,020
oh I think that what you're showing here

966
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,579
is deployment is stuff that I've already

967
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,680
seen and people were talking to me the

968
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,180
ring deployment at the bottom is

969
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,280
absolutely valid no discussion

970
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,960
so the topology you're showing is

971
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,280
reality

972
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,440
and I saw the stuff like this I saw it

973
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,180
double ringed I saw already all this

974
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,460
stuff yeah yeah the the topology is

975
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,060
absolutely of value no discussion

976
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,819
okay okay

977
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:05,040
uh we can't consider about it and maybe

978
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,339
uh this will not be an extension for

979
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,700
rifter or just list some solution and

980
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,520
compare it and we can do some concluding

981
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,079
about the drift fast convergency or

982
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,660
other somethings

983
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,660
so

984
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,319
um

985
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,980
huh

986
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,200
so if we're really looking for work okay

987
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,399
and relevant work

988
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:41,720
these rings are mostly uh

989
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,480
lambdas from what I've seen okay and

990
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,339
this lambdas are building

991
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,079
either at the bottom or the top of the

992
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,220
fabric

993
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,040
and they are content rotating

994
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,619
and actually when you cut the link you

995
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,420
only lose half the lump does

996
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,380
so it's very very weird thing and

997
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,079
we have an extension for Rift that deals

998
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,300
with the stuff

999
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,420
um

1000
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:12,720
if we want to go into this direction on

1001
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,700
the charter we can have a chat with

1002
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,099
problems that poses and what kind of

1003
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,839
solution that needs so we could start to

1004
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,640
work on the stuff

1005
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,579
but let's let me be honest

1006
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,859
um the customers that we had that got

1007
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,420
extremely interested wanted the stuff

1008
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,700
built basically pulled out so we never

1009
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,800
built the stuff at the end but the

1010
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,720
problem is valid when you as when you

1011
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,680
start to deal with rodents

1012
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,540
and counter rotating rodents doing

1013
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,940
Special reuse on lamptas

1014
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,520
probably to cryptic you know but yes the

1015
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,099
ring topologies is they present unique

1016
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:50,040
problems yes that you can do funky stuff

1017
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,720
not in this case but at the top

1018
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,800
especially

1019
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,380
Tony when you say we you mean you're a

1020
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,520
player

1021
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,579
my own the guys who settle my check you

1022
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,980
know every month very great is it

1023
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,200
something that you would be willing to

1024
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,880
bring into ATF you

1025
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,460
we could I like we actually have IPR on

1026
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,440
that stuff we worked all the stuff out

1027
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,720
you know we we've kind of had it

1028
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,599
conceptually all all you know shown and

1029
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,760
then basically you know the the the the

1030
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,740
the guy who was supposed to sign a big

1031
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,599
check for the staff didn't didn't come

1032
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,000
through with the whole thing but

1033
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,319
if we want to go into this direction in

1034
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,119
ITF you know and you guys want to put in

1035
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,460
a charter work on yeah absolutely and

1036
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,900
then I explained the problem and it's

1037
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,480
it's it's it's very very weird but an

1038
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,040
extremely valid problem for the optical

1039
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,240
guys

1040
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,440
okay

1041
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,060
because now we talk about the ring stuff

1042
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,460
so the ring shows up in this situation

1043
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,900
it's kind of simple just let the

1044
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,460
restaurant it will work at the top of

1045
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,140
the fabric with the losing half the lamp

1046
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,760
does is actually far more interesting

1047
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,599
stuff

1048
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,579
so I think if there's demand we will be

1049
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,160
happily willing to entertain Rift and

1050
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,800
rings work right I mean there isn't

1051
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,660
there is no demand I mean I don't have

1052
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,280
the customer signing the very big check

1053
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,740
that's why the the work is dormant yeah

1054
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,720
I mean since Sandy is working and

1055
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,839
there's Demand right hopefully

1056
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,520
um yeah but it's a different case like I

1057
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,980
say it's mostly top of the fabric when a

1058
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,740
lot of fabrics are being hooked up on a

1059
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,500
on a big counter rotating rod and ring

1060
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,420
that is the real stuff because there you

1061
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,339
really need the lamb dust right

1062
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:26,339
and the rodent Behavior starts to matter

1063
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,440
um but in Access cases actually at the

1064
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,720
bottom right and yeah but then you just

1065
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,460
let the restaurant as it is you don't

1066
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,020
need anything

1067
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,400
what happens if your ink is larger

1068
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,780
do you just more and more levels that's

1069
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,880
why I have so many levels in Rift

1070
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,920
and the ztp is so fast it really doesn't

1071
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,660
matter see the whole GTP has been

1072
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:50,420
optimized so when you uh

1073
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,339
the whole GTP is built asymmetric for

1074
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,740
for the failure case right so it comes

1075
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,240
up it's slower when it goes down it's

1076
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,520
really really fast imagine there's a

1077
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,040
knot between four and five

1078
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,160
so when it initiates one is upstream and

1079
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,160
another one is parallel is horizontal

1080
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,200
right yeah correct so you either have to

1081
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,640
allow horizontal links or otherwise

1082
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,160
you'll be single home yes yeah correct

1083
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,420
yeah

1084
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,599
so I think it would be so dead very good

1085
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,480
if you already have more interesting

1086
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,000
case we could talk about yes yeah I mean

1087
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,099
this one is easy because of odd number

1088
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,020
of knots right so you've got here clear

1089
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,520
structure yeah

1090
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,839
yeah I mean it's at least I mean even if

1091
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,599
we don't do so those extensions it

1092
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,359
already merits a draft just to talk

1093
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,280
people through okay how do you deploy

1094
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,780
these rings and what are the operational

1095
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,579
considerations right so you want an

1096
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,900
implementation for example with

1097
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,599
horizontal links yes for that reason and

1098
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:51,000
then it's absolutely valid operational

1099
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,680
consideration what will be the

1100
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,660
convergence times right if because

1101
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,819
imagine this ring is really big right

1102
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,040
and a lot of the ztp has to converge 10

1103
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,140
levels and it's an operational

1104
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,240
consideration now

1105
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,160
because there you will have all you lose

1106
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,160
all the just Genesis FSM today the

1107
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,660
moment you kind of go oh I have to

1108
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,400
change the level drop suggestions is

1109
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,380
because it's you know the the offers are

1110
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,880
not valid anymore right on the level

1111
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,339
change with dropping adjacency so

1112
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,380
if you go all the way to the extreme you

1113
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,480
could actually in the leaf case change

1114
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,160
the FSM

1115
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,319
right like Do not drop keep on

1116
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,660
forwarding and so on but your relief

1117
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,040
life will be good you you readjust so

1118
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,660
those are efficiency improvements for

1119
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,880
ring deployments but yeah those are

1120
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,619
valid consideration or discussion you

1121
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:39,780
know can we start some exchange of

1122
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,480
emails on the list I think it's a valid

1123
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,920
problem and actually interesting

1124
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,079
solution we know that convergence and

1125
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,660
Rings is horrible unless you use tuna

1126
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,780
link or some label stuff it's very

1127
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,119
painful so if we can solve it and given

1128
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,579
how fast drift is you know it could be a

1129
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,500
good solution

1130
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,380
okay so I mean I don't have customers

1131
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,119
pushing me right now with huge Rings

1132
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,240
right so yes in the interesting work

1133
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,059
topic will be like kind of

1134
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,980
forward-looking and you've send the you

1135
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,880
know that really pesters them

1136
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,119
okay I would still encourage first in

1137
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,960
operational draft and then seeing what

1138
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,760
numbers we have on the convergence then

1139
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,400
we start to consider like hacking more

1140
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,900
into the protocol which works fine

1141
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,300
without these extensions right now okay

1142
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,640
thank you let's start with you're

1143
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,920
describing your requirements and again

1144
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,140
half of Europe is this kind of rings

1145
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,200
right they all run like LGBT in both

1146
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,980
directions and it's really horrible yeah

1147
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,619
yeah okay so um

1148
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,540
up to the chairs to drive discussion

1149
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,700
more than happy to participate okay okay

1150
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,800
uh it's great if you can provide some

1151
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,160
tests uh test the number or analysis

1152
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,559
about the converging time about the dtp

1153
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,559
because we can test of audience of

1154
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,260
device in the ring so we can see the

1155
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,839
convergence time what's the number of it

1156
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,720
could you please do some tests on it

1157
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,740
we can do it also yeah I don't have

1158
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,559
cycles for that you may get someone like

1159
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,420
Jordan who may have to burn some Cycles

1160
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,800
you want to play I simply don't have

1161
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,480
Cycles to give you those numbers I don't

1162
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,180
have customers pushing me on the stuff

1163
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,460
uh I have I have converged number

1164
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,460
internal numbers obviously but I cannot

1165
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,380
disclose those and for that case we

1166
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,020
could do something and show it but I

1167
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,079
don't have the cycles for it

1168
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,619
okay

1169
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,720
okay okay

1170
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:56,040
I understand uh uh basically that it's

1171
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,000
uh I mean what I can tell you is that

1172
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
yeah so the loss of adjacency is a very

1173
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,380
complex thing because it depends whether

1174
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,140
you lost the light or the BFD went down

1175
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,780
or whether the hello is timed out right

1176
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,760
so that's an extremely different

1177
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,099
Behavior so so you'll first have to say

1178
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:16,680
what we talk about when we plug in the

1179
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,720
Optics

1180
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,660
um the adjacency is fully up within

1181
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,700
somewhere between 20 to 100 millisec but

1182
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,380
that does not mean anything because you

1183
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,300
have to flood out first sorry for

1184
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,520
my French right so until you flooded

1185
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,020
stuff out you don't have anything anyway

1186
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,319
so the adjacency bring up time

1187
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,020
is actually not even that interesting

1188
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,700
what is far more important do you have

1189
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,020
the database

1190
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,940
all right and then we start to talk

1191
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,319
about

1192
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,599
Healthcare fast can you flood and the

1193
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,700
discussion becomes incredibly

1194
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,440
complicated very fast because it depends

1195
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,359
on how big is your fan out how much CPU

1196
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,579
do you have blah blah blah right how big

1197
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:01,940
is the database the the space is

1198
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:06,059
n-dimensional and then you best way to

1199
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:08,280
actually start to quantify that and the

1200
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,500
Qatar guys did the paper right and I've

1201
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,540
shown you roughly

1202
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,359
it becomes far more interesting how far

1203
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,160
you flood before the whole thing is

1204
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,099
converged rather than how fast can you

1205
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:21,660
flood across a single Lane because what

1206
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,160
you see then with bgp on the failures

1207
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,780
that goes to the whole fabric back and

1208
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,579
forth and that makes the total

1209
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:28,800
convergence much slower than something

1210
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,740
that only flots one hole right on on the

1211
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,020
Prevail and failure but the Katara guys

1212
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,420
did the work so

1213
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,480
here flipping on bgp and then failing a

1214
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,980
link and starting to quantify

1215
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,380
convergence you know the Qatar guys may

1216
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,480
get very interested in the stuff because

1217
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,339
they have the full framework for them to

1218
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:48,720
bring the stuff and play with the stuff

1219
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,520
they have our implementation you know

1220
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,579
they have access to it so they can

1221
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:56,460
actually convert no compare python is of

1222
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,680
course slow-ish all right but you they

1223
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,940
can play with the python they can play

1224
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,319
with our stuff they can play it with

1225
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,660
Isis bgp just basically doing just like

1226
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,480
this right so Katara guys poke them they

1227
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,160
love this kind of thing you know who

1228
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,260
Tony means right

1229
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,079
we have a presentation in 114 and

1230
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,640
routing

1231
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,000
Italians so reach out I think you'll be

1232
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
more than happy for use case and their

1233
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,220
software is really good I think tommaso

1234
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,839
and those guys will be more than happy

1235
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,420
you know there's a bunch of phds going

1236
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,579
on and they have a superb primary that

1237
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:32,099
can very quickly bring the stuff up okay

1238
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:34,500
and frankly I'm doing most of my like

1239
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,260
you know hammering the stuff now you

1240
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,760
know around containers in their

1241
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,099
framework not even using you know like

1242
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:42,839
large amount of machines or anything

1243
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,300
like that so that that that will be a

1244
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,460
great idea let's involve Tomaso let's

1245
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,619
start to talk through this issue we're

1246
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:51,900
in quantify the ring Behavior versus bgp

1247
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,579
or whatever normal Rift with these

1248
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:54,839
extensions

1249
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:56,880
I think that will be a very productive

1250
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,339
thing to do and quantify not in terms of

1251
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:00,960
like five milliseconds versus seven

1252
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,760
milliseconds it's like okay

1253
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,140
what is the total load message wise and

1254
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,720
processing wise and you know a failure

1255
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,640
scope that you put on the network on a

1256
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,160
failure in each of those scenarios

1257
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,260
because this is then what tends to

1258
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,599
behave better right we will start to

1259
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,040
talk about these implementation is a

1260
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,480
little bit faster CPU and so on will

1261
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,099
never finish because it's just basically

1262
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:27,420
watching a lava lamp but the way they

1263
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,700
pull the metrics the metrics are very

1264
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,740
objective you know they basically

1265
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,559
discount a lot of these variables which

1266
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,359
are very hard to quantify

1267
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,160
okay long discussion very productive

1268
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,200
thanks

1269
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,559
so we are thinking about chartering the

1270
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:46,859
by Yokohama potentially so let's start

1271
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:49,319
this discussion after this ATF and see

1272
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,359
how we converge uh we just because

1273
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,059
Jeffrey will be more than willing to

1274
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:58,740
include uh rings in a new Charter

1275
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,260
thank you thank you Jeff thank you

1276
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,200
Connie very useful for suggestion thank

1277
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,480
you all

1278
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,599
very good job Cindy and Tony you only

1279
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,240
spared us two minutes

1280
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,839
foreign

1281
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:23,720
and we hope to see you at ATF 116.

1282
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,059
yeah and big shout out to Jordan thanks

1283
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:29,640
for picking up all the work man tons of

1284
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,559
stuff SVG and the document share parting

1285
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,180
and so on thank you man yeah thanks

1286
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,220
Jordan we received so many compliments

1287
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,160
for PDFs it's just you know

1288
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,680
great work no no worries appreciate it

1289
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,220
foreign

1290
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,700
PDF editor

1291
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,720
foreign

1292
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,359
so I was hoping to come to California

1293
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,099
last week

1294
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,859
but um

1295
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:43,020
and they even had an agent schedule with

1296
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,319
our CTO

1297
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:49,099
internal meeting no trouble

1298
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,680
thanks

1299
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,260
um

1300
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,059
cell phone

1301
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,440
um

1302
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,520
okay

1303
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,520
um

1304
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,819
is different

1305
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:37,020
different

1306
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,319
yeah

1307
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,160
the message

1308
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,339
foreign
