00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
should make sure that Sergio's here

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,619
since he's kind of the show

17
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,600
there he is

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,439
um

19
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,659
we got about six people in the room some

20
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,600
of the usual suspects so that's good

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,380
um

22
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,020

23
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,240

27
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,119
session

28
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,560
um I'm one of the chairs Sean

29
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,540
Niels you want to are you able to come

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,040
off

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,879
okay hi Niels and the other co-chair all

32
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,959
right

33
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,239
let's move on to the good stuff

34
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,700
this is some meeting tips uh please use

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,400
the medeco tool to be able to log in

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,920
that's how we're going to do attendance

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,660
so next time we can make sure we get the

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,760
biggest possible room that we can get

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,340
there are about seven or eight people in

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,440
here so we won't get the biggest room

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,940
but that's also how we're going to use

42
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,680
the queue to manage the queue to get

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,420
people in and out to make sure that the

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,360
remote presenters are and participants

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,580
are actually equally

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,459
um supported

47
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,620
all right so next we got the ITF nope

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,940
well it's Thursday hopefully you've seen

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,700
this before this is primarily

50
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,640
um if you know about IPR say something

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,140
um if you if you can't say anything

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,959
that's all right just don't say anything

53
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,060
um and some other things about

54
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,739
anti-harassment code of conduct Etc

55
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,180
but we'll go into that a little bit more

56
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,560
now

57
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
this is kind of the code of conduct

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,220
guidelines this work group has not had

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,319
any of these problems which is nice to

60
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,580
basically cheat everybody with respect

61
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,980
you know kind of use your head find the

62
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,120
best solution for the whole the internet

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,980
you know I'll let you read this

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,260
um

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,420
so the next slide I think we'll show it

66
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,819
is the mass policy everyone in here is

67
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,680
massed up if you're remote do what you

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,239
want but when you're here you need to

69
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,220
have a mask on

70
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,440
um unless you're you do actually get up

71
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,879
here to talk and you're six feet awake

72
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,500
no need but

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,599
um I think we're good

74
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,340
all right the agenda pretty

75
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,780
straightforward the only thing that

76
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,000
we're really going to pause here for is

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,519
we need a note taker

78
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,560
anybody want to do me a favor and take

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,819
notes

80
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,580
we don't need a play-by-play

81
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,260
but we do need some notes

82
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,299
[Music]

83
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,480
foreign

84
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,459
we're basically just going to note the

85
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,680
actual action items

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,800
um

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,060
basically we got one sorry

88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,979
sounds good yep I will try to take some

89
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,080
notes from you yeah we can we can figure

90
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,220
it out between two of us I don't think

91
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,919
it's going to be that much discussion

92
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,780
hopefully we really got

93
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,340
um one thing on tap which is our working

94
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,280
group uh draft which is wish whip

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
um we're gonna let Sergio go through I

96
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,580
think like one issue we still got about

97
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,560
10 minutes to sign for that and then we

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,080
have 20 minutes to talk about WEP and uh

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,580
the rest of the time is kind of to talk

100
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,040
about the future and the way forward

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,479
um and to note if you were a dispatch

102
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,979
you've probably seen some of the slides

103
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,139
of Sergio's going to talk about but you

104
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,759
know again we're we're here doing our

105
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,740
thing so we're kind of kind of maybe

106
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,259
doing some of the dispatch process

107
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,419
um Sergio I will do you want to run the

108
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,280
slides or do you want me to do it and

109
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,940
you just say next

110
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,660
I mean whatever you want I mean I'm

111
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,660
happy both ways all right let me let me

112
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,160
try to see if I can get them loaded up

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
here and

114
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,660
make this work

115
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,080
of course it's slow is

116
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,219
closed deck see if that works

117
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,360
change deck

118
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,900
come on computer

119
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
is that right it's doing something now

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,820
unable to connect to server not great

121
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,740
all right maybe it's better if you try

122
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,840
to run them

123
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,280
because I'm having some network

124
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,960
connections

125
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,739
issues

126
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,859
so I'm hoping

127
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,720
if you do that because they're loaded up

128
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,220
you ought to be able to load them I

129
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,660
don't know meals if there's any way you

130
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,979
can uh

131
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,600
come to the rescue here but I'm

132
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,039
unfortunately not able to connect

133
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,419
I have them here locally available there

134
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,280
we go great

135
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,139
all right over to you sir Joe

136
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,000
yeah I think that I have been the one

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,160
that I'm sharing so this is new for me

138
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,639
that has this great so this is the

139
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,100
we will first start with the with the

140
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,280
latest version of the with draft

141
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,639
that this is the the five version

142
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,100
so the change between the title is wrong

143
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,500
should be the changes from zero four to

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,580
zero five

145
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,440
uh mainly we'll say about a some minor

146
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,539
field that I have received and some of

147
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,360
the some additional changes one some of

148
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,460
them that are maybe Brown

149
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,639
so we have added the asset the post

150
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,720
header in the in the option responses so

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,699
we can

152
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,100
notify that we allow

153
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,759
a receiving the application sdp in the

154
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,020
post request

155
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,199
we have added owns also that the asset

156
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
asset paths into 101 created responses

157
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,300
but I think that this is a this is brown

158
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,580
I have sent an email yesterday to the to

159
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,139
the mailing list

160
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,960
because I think that the way that the

161
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,039
draft is playing a

162
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,699
is a breeding right now we say that in

163
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:42,860
the 201

164
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,419
response we are going to put the asset

165
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,979
patch with the sap fragment and a mime

166
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,460
type but this

167
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,580
if a death patch header is for the

168
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,539
for the URL for that the post was sent

169
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,520
and not for the warranty in the location

170
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,819
so I think that this is brown and has to

171
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,199
be reverted

172
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,139
but I will like to get some feedback

173
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,199
probably from from Adam that he's or

174
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,900
some STP http

175
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,599
also one with the deeper knowledge of

176
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,000
HTTP to see if this has to be reported

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,440
because is this incorrect or not

178
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,860
so there are changes is that mostly

179
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,139
their workplace clarification so if they

180
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,940
have the way they will resource that no

181
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,419
support the patch method at all either

182
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,559
for a is a restarts or verticalize you

183
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,679
should return a final one

184
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,660
um also we have another clarification on

185
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,300
when the attack was mandatory and when

186
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,019
it is optional

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,300
and also we when when the the s-canital

188
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,940
the ice candidates were of General in

189
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,660
the response on the of the 200 okay

190
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,380
response

191
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,540
um

192
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,700
we have also added a note about the

193
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,800
calling order of said local description

194
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,959
and and the on the HTTP boss the request

195
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
to avoid ice restarts

196
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,300
and also we have added that they prefer

197
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,860
options to to configure Ice is to use

198
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,620
the information return in a 2001

199
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,600
response and not to rely on the options

200
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,700
on making an option request today

201
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,060
to the to the web server if it is not

202
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,160
really mandatory for the client for the

203
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,779
client because it does not support to

204
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,760
updated configuration the ISO

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,459
reconfiguration one say after the third

206
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,700
local this return has been

207
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,940
it has been created and also there has

208
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,279
been fixes in the example

209
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,540
uh to make it uh so it was quite in

210
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,459
another document and also we have made

211
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,959
the data an opaque value So to avoid a

212
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,880
misinterpretation by implementers and

213
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,279
thinking that it has to have some value

214
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,160
when it is not meant to to

215
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,980
be to have any sense

216
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,500
also I have added the Ayana registration

217
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,899
based on their feedback and also I've

218
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,360
done a lot main acknowledged many

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,940
section

220
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,060
so this is the all the changes that has

221
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,580
been done in the in the in the latest

222
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,920
draft I think that all of there has been

223
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,899
already

224
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,060
reviewed and and agreed only either did

225
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,300
you have for or the mailing list but I

226
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,339
mean if there is any issue with any of

227
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,500
these changes I mean just let me know

228
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,260
just say pressure I comment in the

229
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,240
either in YouTube or when we do the

230
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,920
working group last call

231
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,320
so the

232
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,500
the last slide is about the NS steps

233
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,320
that we only have to check the

234
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,779
correctness of the asset pads response

235
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,600
and if it is not correct just revert the

236
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,240
changes so it is removed from the graph

237
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,640
and there are appending minor editorial

238
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,399
fixed in in the g-hub in the vehicle

239
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,079
drop that are not in the zero five

240
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,000
drop because I have noticed it after

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,380
policing it

242
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,820
so when we have checked the theft parts

243
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,480
and we I will just

244
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,360
submit a zero six version and then I

245
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,560
think that we should do the working

246
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,380
group Last Call on on it

247
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,720
I hope that if we can have the asset

248
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,940
patch check either during the in this

249
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,920
meeting or today or tomorrow I can do

250
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,180
the and I can submit the new pen draft

251
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,519
during this next week so we can have the

252
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,200
working group let's call as soon as

253
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,500
possible

254
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,300
yeah you beat me to it I was going to

255
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,740
ask you when we were going to get that

256
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,560
so um hey if we're gonna get in the next

257
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,240
couple days I would love to be able to

258
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,860
go ahead and work last call this

259
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,220
starting next week I might give it uh a

260
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,899
little extra longer than two week

261
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,839
working group last call because of some

262
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,700
major American holidays which most

263
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,940
people will be Mia on but um definitely

264
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,560
I would like to try to if you if you can

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,880
literally if you can promise me that

266
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,899
you'll get it done we can get the

267
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,220
working group last call started next

268
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,079
week and we can end it sometime in early

269
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,040
December I think that would be fantastic

270
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
is there are there any objections to

271
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,700
that uh path

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,959
of course can't see the job room or

273
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:46,980
anything because my network connection

274
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,720
is shot so

275
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,579
um unless we see anything we're gonna go

276
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,920
okay let's uh let's proceed with that

277
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,399
that path Sergio and um okay we can we

278
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,019
can switch over to

279
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,240
web

280
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,740
okay let me see

281
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,339
and again so we're we're kind of begging

282
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,740
uh begging forgiveness from the working

283
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,779
group because technically this is an in

284
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,579
scope but since we have you here and we

285
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,720
have been talking about this a little

286
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,339
bit we're hoping you're willing to

287
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,920
indulge the overstepping of the bounds

288
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,180
of the charter while we have this

289
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,740
discussion

290
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,620
I'm trying to police it again no

291
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,600
seriously

292
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,579
that's nice

293
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,779
oh now it's back

294
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,300
I know and I think I need to go into

295
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,220
I have asked for them to be able to

296
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,560
present again but I don't see the end

297
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,219
okay

298
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,480
good thank you Adam I expect a thorough

299
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,339
review of Dash 06 when it comes out

300
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,480
during working group last call

301
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,139
appreciate it

302
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,420
excellent

303
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,399
Okay so

304
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,240
I want to well I wanted to do on last

305
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,399
meeting but we didn't have time for it

306
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,300
so I'm just mostly

307
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,100
uh going to present the same slides that

308
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,279
I did let's say I presented for last

309
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,760
last meeting but with minute updates

310
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
first I know that the grace is

311
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,779
explicitly out of its scope of the

312
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,160
working group

313
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,980
but also

314
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,500
uh right now the equivalent graph of a

315
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,959
web is a reuse most of the mechanics

316
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,300
that has been put in place for Whip and

317
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,220
the first drop was mostly mainly yes

318
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,019
replacing whip by web and that's all

319
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,380
that I I did for work with the first

320
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,600
wrap and

321
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
so why why do we need web why do we need

322
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
to handle the the play by side or the of

323
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,639
the streaming with the webrtc

324
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,399
uh first because we are seeing that at

325
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,160
least in my side I seen that quite a lot

326
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,320
of friends lately to be able to

327
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,980
be able to have internet ability between

328
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,800
webrtc services and product and mostly I

329
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,680
see also a

330
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,680
trend that is mostly about having backup

331
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,899
solutions that for example being able to

332
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,019
switch from webrtc provider to another

333
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,880
if and there are there is any downtime

334
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,779
in any of them and also to avoid the

335
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,860
service login

336
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,440
so you can have multiple or you can rely

337
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,860
on multiple webrtc services or providers

338
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,399
without having to be logged in

339
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,459
so this is say well this was not the the

340
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,199
one of the the initial goals for the

341
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,320
um when I pressed when I brought a web

342
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,079
since I have that graphene I see a lot

343
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,019
of attraction in in that regular

344
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,079
also there are other benefits like for

345
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,019
example we can reduce the player server

346
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,720
the name that can be integrated easily I

347
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,279
mean there is for example with them epic

348
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,139
that sound I feel like that you don't

349
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,180
have to write your own player you just

350
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,880
use whatever player is available and

351
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,980
there is a quite a lot of my versions

352
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,279
either open source of of closures that

353
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,060
allows to have a much better a user

354
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,940
experience that if you build your own

355
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,720
and also this protocol will allow

356
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,300
integrating with the impacted us for

357
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,600
example this has been a report and when

358
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
we there has been a joint effort or what

359
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,720
they went in the name impact as if to be

360
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
able to have like a common player that

361
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,780
could use both mpegdas and webrtc when

362
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,059
you will use webrtc for the live version

363
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,640
of the of the stream and you can use it

364
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,439
that's version to use the timesheet

365
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,380
version of the of the of the screen so

366
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,720
you can start watching the one event in

367
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,140
in life but you can go back in time and

368
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,040
connect to the to the impact Das stream

369
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,700
and that it is has when you can just

370
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,700
select from what time you want to watch

371
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,700
the the screen and with seamless in the

372
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,440
same player

373
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,260
and also and there is also one very

374
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,260
important case that it is a while in

375
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,299
traditional in webrtc Services we are

376
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,160
running the all the services in either

377
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,080
in a native application or in a full

378
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,880
browsers

379
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,160
there are some devices that don't

380
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,440
support

381
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,780
webrtc very well for example and like

382
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,280
the smart TVs

383
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,100
when it is going to be much easier to to

384
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,520
try to get the TV vendors to support uh

385
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,879
yesterday

386
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,240
by just having to provide to be able to

387
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,900
play a web streams and not have to

388
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,240
provide the full flavor apis that it is

389
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,360
much difficult to maintain and

390
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,179
and and there's some megabyte levels in

391
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,620
their apis

392
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,860
so now the last thing is that a weapon

393
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,720
web could be used together for service

394
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,940
in the operating so you can have you

395
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,160
have a web service and a web service you

396
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,320
can try to to just create a gate with

397
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,840
that post do the interoperative it in

398
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,460
both

399
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,620
so the question is is if we should

400
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,380
restart this working groups to uh to

401
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,039
include also egress as a scene has said

402
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,940
I presented it in this part so Monday

403
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,500
um and I think that the construction was

404
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,340
that

405
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,799
um we should or the work in the with

406
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,600
working groups should be able to decide

407
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,200
if we want to recharge the the

408
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,840
the working group or not and we don't

409
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
have to go back to this patch and to try

410
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,299
to find a way so whatever we decide we

411
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,260
are free to to decide if we want to the

412
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,320
uh to change the scope of the of the

413
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,340
charter and out of the the web

414
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,460
the protocol as a working group item

415
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,500
so so Adam let me just jump in here real

416
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,120
quick so I guess I would I just want to

417
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,860
say that I I completely agree with the

418
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,200
way Sergio characterized we went to

419
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,700
dispatch and they were like why are you

420
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,799
coming to us you're already a working

421
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,960
group you can just recharge her but they

422
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,520
I think in other instances they might

423
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,440
have said why didn't why didn't you come

424
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,419
to us if you so we kind of got

425
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,280
a free pass essentially if the working

426
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
group decides that we we would like to

427
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,700
recharger I think then we just basically

428
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,440
have to convince the ad that's the right

429
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,260
thing to do and present good text so I

430
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,520
think that was a fair characterization

431
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,380
of what actually happened earlier so

432
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,799
Adam

433
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,520
get mute

434
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,299
unfortunately I can be of no help

435
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,379
because I'm off the network again

436
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,640
and I can turn on Adam's microphone

437
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,240
remotely either so yeah actually well on

438
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,480
there

439
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,600
oh

440
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,760
all right well maybe we'll um try to

441
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,340
loop back to Adam and uh Jonathan's in

442
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,780
the room and so is Harold so maybe we

443
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,100
can give him a little bit of time

444
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,740
well Adam are you audible now or should

445
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,640
I go ahead

446
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,400
okay can you hear me now yes yeah we can

447
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,559
great all right I think it did not

448
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,200
survive a device earlier in the

449
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,360
conference um sorry about that so I'm

450
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,280
gonna do a full 180 from what I said

451
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,440
last time we had this discussion and and

452
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,200
say that I now support although somewhat

453
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,320
reluctantly the notion of retartering um

454
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,500
to do the web work uh I still have the

455
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,200
same concerns last time about

456
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,820
um the number of people that it looks

457
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,320
like we're going to be able to attract

458
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,299
to actually work on this

459
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,880
um I'm not going to have more Cycles

460
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
than I did this first time around

461
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,760
um

462
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,580
to help move the work along um and it

463
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,760
the volume of discussion on the list is

464
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,880
still rather slow but I am definitely

465
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,620
seeing a lot of interest in the industry

466
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,840
for this and people are moving forward

467
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,620
with the protocol uh as specified I see

468
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,299
like major service providers already

469
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,940
deploying this in like beta trials

470
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,320
um and I think it would be far far

471
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,900
better to have uh you know a written

472
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,380
down and actually gratified version of

473
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,820
the protocol as opposed to just having

474
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,039
things based on a draft and I can't

475
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,659
imagine the better place to do that than

476
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,000
this working group um so again it's like

477
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,740
I I would love if we could somehow bring

478
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,860
these folks into the ietf to help move

479
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,440
this work forward so if folks have ideas

480
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,940
about how to make that happen it would

481
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,140
be great

482
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,919
um but yeah it's like I said I I now

483
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,919
support adding this to the wish Charter

484
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,220
okay great Jonathan

485
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,919
yeah Jonathan Lennox I mean I think your

486
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,679
analogy was Dash as somewhat convinced

487
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,179
me I was sort of dubious before but I

488
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,039
think sort of the idea that in browsers

489
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,299
this is just implemented in JavaScript

490
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,500
though there could be libraries for it

491
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,020
but for embedded things

492
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,760
it needs to be it can be implemented for

493
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,679
real which is easier than letting them

494
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,780
run arbitrary JavaScript that seems

495
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,940
reasonable my concern I mean and I think

496
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,059
the cert the your regular expression at

497
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,559
the second bullet is certainly a very

498
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,539
easy thing to do

499
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,120
um My worry is how much more do we need

500
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,000
in particular if we need to be

501
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
you know Feature Feature equivalent to

502
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,919
Dash and basically have let you know

503
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,720
that people say well in dash I if I'm

504
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
doing it over Dash I can do you know

505
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,980
subtitles I need to be able to do

506
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,980
subtitles in web well that's just one

507
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,120
example off the top of my head I don't

508
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,140
know why everything that's in dash

509
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,020
that's my worry if we end up having to

510
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,059
shovel everything in there to get in on

511
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,860
how much more work that's going to be I

512
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,440
think if this is just the your regular

513
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,059
expression this is very easy and it's

514
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,039
sort of a no-brainer and I see the

515
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,020
benefit to it but I'm worried about how

516
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,760
much the scope is going to increase

517
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,260
okay

518
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,900
yeah the in fact this is in one of my

519
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,840
last my latest slides about what is the

520
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,940
the

521
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,919
Delta that we have to

522
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,340
to add from uh from web to week because

523
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,440
as you have said there are some some

524
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
functionalities that are specific to to

525
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,360
playback that we have not worried yet in

526
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,000
in in just size so this is already

527
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,860
covered also in the slides later on

528
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
foreign

529
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,059
um this seems to be a simple

530
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,500
specification for doing a simple job

531
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,080
we have other groups like mock who are

532
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,740
trying to build the the grand total

533
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,020
solution of changing everything so that

534
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,059
so that we can achieve things we cannot

535
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,980
do but

536
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,140
a simple tool for a simple job we should

537
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,840
simple tools need specifications we

538
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,480
should specify it go ahead

539
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,840
okay

540
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,539
all right Timothy

541
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,659
yeah 10 pounds in here yeah um I'm in

542
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:04,919
favor of us doing this I think

543
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,900
particularly the embedded stuff makes

544
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,780
makes sense I have a slight preference

545
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,440
for us doing it after we've got

546
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,140
got uh whip out the way

547
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,200
I kind of can we is there a is a problem

548
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,820
with sequencing it so that we don't

549
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,860
change the charter until we get whip out

550
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,120
the door

551
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,760
and by out the door do you mean like RFC

552
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,320
number and published or do you mean like

553
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,279
through the isg

554
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,220
prepared to negotiate on that but I just

555
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,500
feel like if we we're short of Cycles

556
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,179
then trying to do two things at once

557
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,100
seems suicidal

558
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,440
okay so I'm so here's what I'm hoping to

559
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,779
happen is that Sergio is going to pump

560
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,700
out a draft here in the next couple days

561
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,140
we're going to run a working group last

562
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,120
call when that working group last call

563
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,799
completes Niels and I are going to put

564
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,080
our head together and flip a coin and

565
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,279
figure out who's going to be the

566
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,200
shepherd and we're going to push it

567
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
forward out of the working group and at

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,700
that point we can start to do

569
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,799
um Charter revisions to look at that

570
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,480
because it'll take weeks for that to

571
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,960
happen as well so if that is kind of the

572
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,779
if we do it at that kind of pace is that

573
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,100
kind of work

574
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,159
Sean Sean I I have to uh I've done the

575
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,140
or started the shepherding for for the

576
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,240
wish draft parade so oh so that takes

577
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,820
one step out of the way exactly so like

578
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,440
I'm waiting basically To Go version 06

579
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,659
and then we're gonna do it shouldn't be

580
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,940
done quickly I mean I'm I'm thinking

581
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,039
like in the new year

582
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,860
we'll we will start uh we'll put up a

583
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,320
GitHub repo we'll put in the original

584
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,179
charter and then people can start

585
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,240
walking away at making changes

586
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,460
um so I'm hoping that

587
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,400
the changes that we would get via the

588
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,620
director reviews and through the isg

589
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,080
wouldn't won't be earth-shattering to

590
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,820
this so I'm hoping that we won't have a

591
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,000
cycle problem but I I do acknowledge

592
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,380
that we don't want to do too many things

593
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,299
at once here because we're just running

594
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,039
out of Cycles from people so let's try

595
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,179
to

596
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,500
um what we'll do is we'll start the

597
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,360
retarding process after we get the

598
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,580
document out the door

599
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,440
um but nothing to say that Sergio can't

600
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,600
we can't keep talking about this uh

601
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
actually on the list if people do have

602
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,080
Cycles Pierce

603
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:21,600
uh yeah it seems uh like the integration

604
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,059
with Dash can potentially get to

605
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,279
fairly complicated as mentioned some of

606
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,659
the um

607
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,240
issues around it's all timestamps in

608
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
media and how you do

609
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,100
uh subtitles and everything in some ways

610
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,740
it seems as potentially a

611
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,120
more

612
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,220
a nasty sort of uh

613
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,140
part to it whether it be pulled apart

614
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,760
and at it as a separate thing I don't

615
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,559
know but

616
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,659
not quite sure how we separate out but

617
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,059
it might get because I would

618
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,940
um we're involved in that uh

619
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,460
Dash if report that started to try to

620
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,120
tackle some of these issues but then um

621
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,740
it seemed like there was quite a few

622
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,059
things to deal with uh

623
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,959
I don't know what you think uh Sergio

624
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,400
yeah I mean

625
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,480
I would like to have the like the basic

626
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,419
um media flows established with web and

627
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,020
at least I probably on the first draft

628
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,059
just because mainly we have already make

629
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,340
most of the working whip so yes a happy

630
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,980
meeting webpage seems like a very

631
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,659
easy leaf then a is bet when we are able

632
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,400
to have like a first version of web we

633
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,380
can go for example to the back to the

634
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,980
Sif and see if adding support for for

635
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,799
example subtitles or changes a different

636
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,620
or or having multiple audio languages

637
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,020
and be able to switch between them makes

638
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,140
sense to be done like within the web

639
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,020
specification or we will have to or it

640
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,740
would if it would be better to to to

641
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,080
be a production of the impact does stuff

642
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,240
for example the MTD and try to integrate

643
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,539
both protocols together so we can reduce

644
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,460
some of them so I don't know yet but

645
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,020
this is the best of them

646
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,320
but I think that if we try to we get

647
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,820
some momentum having the the web

648
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,460
protocol in in the in draft they are

649
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,700
specified it will be much easier to to

650
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,980
to

651
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,080
get Advanced on those topics so I will

652
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,720
try to or what my proposal would be not

653
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,760
to uh

654
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,860
the same thing that we have done with

655
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,419
beep uh don't make the these other

656
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,779
features be a blocker about having a

657
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:46,080
first version of web or for example

658
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,260
early drafts and try to see if we can

659
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,539
for example add that add them later on

660
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,279
with the essentials either if it is a

661
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,580
HTTP res interface or it is by adding

662
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,740
data challenge support for web

663
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,200
but I think that it is also that they

664
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,120
are going to be like allowance that we

665
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,460
can negotiate and it is not really

666
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,899
a

667
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,779
like a Blog stopper to have them in the

668
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,059
web standard to be able to to use them

669
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:16,639
and and it to be adopted by the industry

670
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,740
okay yeah yeah I think it sounds

671
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,460
reasonable I guess because you've got

672
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,440
sort of media type description so you've

673
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,440
got STP trying to map that to the media

674
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,779
descriptions within Dash and also then

675
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:30,779
you've got the time frame aspects around

676
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,600
the dash MPD that doesn't really have a

677
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,120
kind of an analogy in uh

678
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,899
in the uh webrtc world I think in terms

679
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,179
of description

680
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,260
okay yeah

681
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,460
all right

682
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,080
um I think it's probably not a good use

683
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
of our time to actually slap up the

684
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,620
charter and start to edit it I think

685
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,240
that's kind of maybe kind of a complete

686
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,140
waste of time so I think the um we

687
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,059
should set everyone free here give them

688
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,279
30 minutes back of their lives unless

689
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,299
there's something else to discuss

690
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,919
are there

691
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,230
yeah I mean

692
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,940
[Laughter]

693
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,860
I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off I

694
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,020
actually hadn't looked so there are more

695
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,580
we could proceed for because we have 30

696
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,919
more minutes of time so let's make sure

697
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,559
I mean I think that most of the

698
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,720
discussion has been already covered in

699
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,299
some parts of the of the slides but I

700
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,860
mean yes I think that it would be great

701
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,500
if we can

702
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,760
go through them because I think that we

703
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,440
can spend this time to to discuss some

704
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,559
of the items so absolutely go ahead Yeah

705
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,860
so basically the the web protocol is

706
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,500
basically the same thing that uh as whip

707
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,740
so we have the the web players and an

708
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,140
HTTP post with sap offer then the

709
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,360
endpoint return on a DP answer with the

710
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,600
the 200 or 201 response and then

711
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,500
everything the the request and the ice

712
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,960
and the details is established with the

713
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
media server and the rtcb float start to

714
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,039
go from the media server to the web

715
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,460
player

716
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,640
in the

717
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,039
there has been some discussion that I

718
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,440
don't know if this is a the best thing

719
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,419
to do or not because we don't want to

720
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,820
have two different ways of operating in

721
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,720
the

722
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,679
in the draft so this and the the current

723
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,960
graph also covers it but I don't know if

724
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,840
we want to remove it or not that they

725
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,380
will say that there was a also like an

726
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,039
interest of having

727
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,779
the service

728
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,799
to be able to provide the sdp offer so

729
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,020
and then the player does not need to

730
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,580
know for example you want to establish

731
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,340
an audio video session or only audio

732
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,700
and also and there was some claim that

733
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,320
some implementation don't support great

734
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,440
offers so and also this will allow

735
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,100
weapon weapon to probability

736
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,640
the there are some pros with this for

737
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,799
this approach that it is the for example

738
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,779
the term server configuration would be

739
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,480
solved because you will be able to get

740
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,880
the eye service before they having to

741
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,539
send the the sap answer

742
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,440
but there is a big con at least from my

743
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,419
side that it is the media server does

744
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,779
not actually know what codecs may be

745
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,240
um maybe

746
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,380
used by the

747
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,480
by the stream when it is established

748
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,980
because for example at least in in

749
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,899
miligas we allow the players to connect

750
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,240
before the Apple stream is started

751
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,220
and the publication can choose whatever

752
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,220
codecs they use so we are able to switch

753
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,260
between dynamically between the Codex so

754
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,140
if the if the

755
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,059
it is difficult for us at least to

756
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,419
provide an sdp offer with the to the

757
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,340
player because we will just have to to

758
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,260
provide a list of all the potential

759
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,519
corrected and that may that assist in

760
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,640
fact

761
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,879
so this is one of them one point that if

762
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,179
we that we will need to to decide if we

763
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,179
want to support it or not just none so

764
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,418
a in this one

765
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,000
no yep

766
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,280
so what's missing us Jonathan I think it

767
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
was younger than the one that said that

768
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,339
so uh as Jonathan said that web has more

769
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,780
requirements internal functionality than

770
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,418
with for example within the

771
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,699
and I think that the whole thing is that

772
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,520
we have a good

773
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
um

774
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,580
we can check what are the the

775
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,320
misinfusion ideas by taking what does

776
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,619
provide because we should try to be like

777
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,740
a a

778
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,780
future uh we should have should be able

779
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,160
to provide the same functionality as

780
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,619
does provide that for example would be

781
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,320
would be about having multi languages in

782
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,320
in audio to be able to do remote PESA

783
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,180
and mutant avoid having Western

784
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,020
resources if they pay the the

785
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,020
if if the if the player is supposed to

786
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,220
support subtitles and legations

787
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,900
supporting metadata specifically for

788
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,300
example the for time stamping and and

789
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,680
having a

790
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,660
like the smtpa and the timestamps and

791
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,300
also how to do client-side resolution

792
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,760
and quality selection for example to be

793
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,440
able to have

794
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,339
um even if the service is doing a layer

795
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,800
switching between supercars or SBC to be

796
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,780
able to allow the client to say to

797
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,240
specify to to know which layers are

798
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,540
available and for example to yes and say

799
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,060
that and send me a lower resolution even

800
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,578
if there is a if I am able to do a

801
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,540
um a Higher One

802
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,940
so the

803
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,680
I don't I think that this can be

804
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,260
implemented as add-ons today

805
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,740
to the to the web specifications and

806
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,740
they don't change the what we are going

807
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,440
to to implement so we can add it on top

808
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,260
and probably as a optional and feature

809
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,040
that we can negotiate

810
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,579
uh yeah Dartmouth I think

811
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,320
um sorry I should have put myself in the

812
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,760
queue I apologize

813
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,300
um uh I I think now the I think sort of

814
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,180
the big picture consequence of this is a

815
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,280
lot of these things possibly everything

816
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,920
but subtitles is going to require fresh

817
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,859
offer answers so we're going to need

818
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:48,300
General fresh offer answers in a bunch

819
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,040
of places not just

820
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,740
offer answers for ice restart so that's

821
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,420
going to be

822
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,520
you know a fairly

823
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,920
notable

824
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,060
um

825
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,160
change to the protocol I think that's

826
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,000
something that's something we're going

827
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,140
to need to think about

828
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,880
and I guess the question is are you

829
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,740
going to support are can we do this

830
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,720
entirely with client

831
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,960
initiated offer answer or does it have

832
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,040
to be

833
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,300
or is there some place where they're you

834
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,680
know where the server decides hey we

835
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,880
need a fresh offer answer because that's

836
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,920
going to be even more complicated does

837
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,420
he need to have some sort of polling to

838
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,680
notify of that

839
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,260
well we can use data channels

840
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,359
yeah and then I think that's probably

841
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,680
for subtitles you'd probably want

842
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,780
somebody something over data Channel

843
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,880
um but I don't know the details

844
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,320
um and we need to let somebody's on the

845
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,960
chat commented that there's you know the

846
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,300
MP4 container does

847
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,420
you know everything you ever amazing

848
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,680
quad number of different things the

849
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,700
question is which one of those things

850
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,140
how many of those things do we actually

851
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,440
need so

852
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,400
thanks Niels

853
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,099
individual

854
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,380
um just clarification on the on the

855
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,940
slide where you said like whether we

856
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,940
should support uh reversing the um the

857
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,740
offer answer

858
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,339
um uh roles uh if you connect the

859
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,160
players first

860
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,880
um

861
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,800
don't you run into the problem that if

862
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,839
the if the if the whip client then later

863
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,940
connects you might still run into the

864
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,500
problem that like you have codec in this

865
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,160
match

866
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,140
or you're like how are you going to

867
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,760
enforce from the server side that

868
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,680
basically the one codec which would get

869
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,880
set

870
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,820
I mean but if the if the player sends

871
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,859
the zp offer and data for example the

872
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:33,960
unit super ab1

873
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,460
I mean

874
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,940
I cannot do much at least you know I

875
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,980
mean I can I can try to even do trust

876
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,320
coding in the server side but I mean the

877
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,480
server will the player will send me all

878
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,020
that it supports

879
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,240
is so it is if I run into this yeah

880
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,280
let's say like if you if you connect to

881
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,099
the web players and you have negotiated

882
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,320
something with them uh there's no

883
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,579
guarantee that whatever you have

884
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,359
negotiated with them will uh match with

885
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,060
the with the which player what if it

886
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,740
connects later basically or

887
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,020
yeah but I'm what I'm trying to say like

888
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,280
basically switching the rules doesn't

889
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,680
take away that problem as if I maybe I'm

890
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,000
misunderstanding something yeah yeah

891
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,040
yeah yeah yeah I mean we have the same

892
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,380
problem if regardless of who sends for

893
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,660
the the answer they offer first

894
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,740
okay

895
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,578
that was up

896
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,020
yeah um Tim Hanson couple of things uh I

897
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,320
don't like the switching of the answer I

898
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,740
don't see that I don't believe that

899
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,260
purported benefits like you're never

900
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,000
going to be able to connect a whip to a

901
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,079
whip

902
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,700
uh without something in the middle

903
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,000
anyway and so saying that it makes it

904
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,859
easier I think is kind of

905
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,200
artificial to be honest

906
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,960
um I think it complicates the the things

907
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,079
somewhat unnecessarily so I'm I'm kind

908
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,480
of not uh I don't buy that and it adds a

909
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,280
round trip of course

910
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,800
um so I don't buy that and I think the

911
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,280
second thing here that kind of the

912
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,900
additional features I think those

913
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,000
channels are the way to go and even if

914
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,300
you end up needing to renegotiate

915
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,520
um you can renegotiate over the day's

916
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,320
channel

917
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,300
so and it's worth I mean we've done a

918
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,880
ton of stuff where we use the label of

919
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,619
the data channel to indicate what the

920
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,599
purpose of that channel is so you don't

921
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,960
have to like you know it's sort of you

922
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,240
don't have to agree it in the STP you

923
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,280
can just say there will be data channels

924
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,800
and then those data channels arrive and

925
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,680
they have meanings based on their um you

926
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,980
know web subtitle Dash en it might be

927
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,599
the title of the the label of the

928
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,880
channel and then you know what it is

929
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,520
um so I think we can I I think we can

930
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,260
get a long way towards these sorts of

931
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,480
features without needing to do another

932
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,400
round of offer answer and even if we

933
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,020
have to do another round of offer answer

934
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,300
to add a track or something you can do

935
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,960
that negotiation over a spare and

936
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,300
negotiating data channel so you can

937
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,859
create today's channel for doing offer

938
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,020
answer over and you do offer answer over

939
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,220
that and um and keep your uh keep your

940
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,500
your HTTP server out of the loop because

941
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,579
it doesn't need to be in it

942
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,280
thanks

943
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,520
foreign just

944
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,079
encouraging

945
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,960
scope limiting

946
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,060
I don't think we need to specify every

947
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,500
feature of Dash as a feature of web

948
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,160
that will just lead to

949
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,200
well kissing contest

950
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,380
but uh

951
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,359
there are a number of things that we

952
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,598
could

953
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,480
write specs for that would be applicable

954
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,960
in any webrtc context

955
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,339
subtitles especially

956
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,200
yep and the client-side resolution

957
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,119
called The Selection thing but they

958
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,339
don't need to be in web

959
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,579
so let's I I would encourage you to go

960
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:22,500
for a very simple web and let's add

961
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,040
features when we need them and

962
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,520
if possible use them in all contexts to

963
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,560
a webrtc are applicable

964
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,200
yeah yeah I agree with that for example

965
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,880
a

966
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,280
I already have been working for example

967
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,940
in a solution for subtitles a for whip

968
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,820
that obviously and this will have to be

969
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,220
done somewhere else probably maybe Decor

970
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,839
or a music

971
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:51,540
and then we can we could reuse then they

972
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,359
were here so that's what that was also

973
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:57,740
my goal so I think that uh

974
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,119
having a full set of functionality is

975
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,400
like a like the goal for me for my

976
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,160
service but it they don't need to be all

977
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,720
done in web

978
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,940
okay

979
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,599
uh John Athletics again yeah I think the

980
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,339
sort of

981
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,619
subtlety here is there's

982
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,780
I mean we have you know a number of

983
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,420
layers of indirection here right I mean

984
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,079
you know web users webrtc webrtc uses

985
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,319
sdp offer answer STP offer answer uses

986
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:30,480
sdp and you know and I think it'll for a

987
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,160
lot of these things Yes somewhere in the

988
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,380
30-year history of sdp there have been

989
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,940
solutions to find for these are they

990
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,980
good I don't know are they implemented

991
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,020
in browsers no could they build under

992
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,119
browsers probably will they be ask

993
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,280
Harold but um

994
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,040
I mean if if you say if you say hey if

995
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,660
we add this to webrtc so it might just

996
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,119
be a matter of not even defining new

997
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,980
Solutions but finding like Adam

998
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,140
mentioned there is an RTP payload for

999
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,819
ttml

1000
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,920
um I don't know if it's quite solves our

1001
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,020
problem but probably roughly does so

1002
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,780
maybe if you can maybe just say hey

1003
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,700
browsers add this ttml to your webrtc

1004
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,900
stacks and

1005
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,520
you know and that will

1006
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,380
and there's an actual use case for this

1007
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,819
because we want to be able to do this

1008
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,040
for you know live Dash and I think

1009
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,119
that's a use case the brothers are

1010
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,819
actually interested in so

1011
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:20,040
um but yeah I think this might just be a

1012
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,079
matter of scouring the web the RFC

1013
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,579
archive rather than defining new work

1014
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,960
um

1015
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,720
yeah uh just got what I was going to say

1016
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,460
something around

1017
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,540
um

1018
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,099
yeah okay uh

1019
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,960
I can't quite think what I was going to

1020
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,680
say

1021
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,940
um

1022
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,319
ah

1023
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,480
yeah the data Channel thing so I just

1024
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,240
sort of um

1025
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,099
webrtc whether whether you whether you

1026
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,800
want to sort of stay with just using the

1027
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,960
webrtc data Channel whether you want to

1028
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,560
be kind of um open to using just

1029
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,500
websockets so in some senses maybe a

1030
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,020
higher level abstraction when one talks

1031
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,819
about using it again it's something that

1032
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:14,160
kind of came out of the um

1033
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,660
uh

1034
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,079
out of the work that the dash if thing I

1035
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:20,280
mean I guess

1036
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,720
because well I guess with the sort of

1037
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,579
these types of approaches we're using

1038
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,500
Dash typically

1039
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,119
the data Channel approach doesn't

1040
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,280
necessarily isn't necessarily kind of

1041
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,560
needed because it's often not a

1042
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,660
peer-to-peer type of um

1043
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,500
communication but uh I guess it doesn't

1044
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,839
have to be but uh

1045
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,760
just a thought really as to whether or

1046
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,980
wants to sort of allow that flexibility

1047
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,319
as opposed to just stipulating just use

1048
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,200
the data channel in web ITC

1049
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,060
hmm

1050
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,680
yeah I mean I don't have a I I have not

1051
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,540
started to work on a solution and so

1052
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,000
then I don't have to check how this

1053
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,220
implemented with them and back does but

1054
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,619
I can there is no limitation about

1055
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,780
producing where was socket over data

1056
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,520
challenge at the moment probably when we

1057
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,099
start to check it we will see that it

1058
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,720
makes more sense to use one on another

1059
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,060
or maybe probably with web it is Maximus

1060
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,400
and to use

1061
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,740
but if we are integrated with thus maybe

1062
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,740
it's easier to have like a separate web

1063
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,800
socket and a web connections that are

1064
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,040
not I don't know yet so but yes I mean I

1065
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,480
think the other thing that we should

1066
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,119
just say close ourselves to just a

1067
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,200
single set of solutions

1068
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,900
so coming back on the today's Channel

1069
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,920
thing

1070
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,839
um yeah we turns out uh the this channel

1071
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,140
uh API looks very like the websocket API

1072
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,140
in the browser so actually we've done a

1073
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,880
few things where you consume one on top

1074
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,040
of the other and the the

1075
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,980
so JavaScript author actually doesn't

1076
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,619
know which it is and doesn't care

1077
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,540
um because semantics are pretty similar

1078
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,339
the open semantics are different but

1079
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,319
once it's open it's pretty

1080
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,060
indistinguishable to be honest so you

1081
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,700
can you can fake one with the other so

1082
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,980
you might not actually need to

1083
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,819
um

1084
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:20,160
kind of enforce that at the client side

1085
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,420
obviously at the server side it's

1086
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,040
completely different

1087
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,599
um and I think that's where you're going

1088
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,700
to come up against it's like where does

1089
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,060
this metadata arrive uh get generated

1090
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,520
does it get generated kind of close to

1091
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,020
the media server where your media is

1092
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,000
coming from is it tied to that in which

1093
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,460
case data channels is the right path

1094
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,859
whereas if it's coming from you know

1095
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,740
where your HTTP request went then

1096
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,780
websockets is the right path and so I

1097
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,099
think that you're going to fight because

1098
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,960
the media server is probably a long way

1099
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,720
back behind some that whereas your your

1100
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,119
web server is is out the front so I

1101
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,339
think like which you end up choosing is

1102
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:57,900
going to be almost an architectural

1103
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,119
decision rather than

1104
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,460
um anything else but yeah I mean our

1105
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,859
experiences that from the client side

1106
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,540
you almost can't tell the difference

1107
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,200
between them

1108
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,460
we seem to have drained the queue yeah

1109
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,880
all right do we want to ask now for uh I

1110
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,740
think we had on the agenda the the

1111
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,260
question whether uh regarding the

1112
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,240
rechartering

1113
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,359
um

1114
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,720
lots of lots of support for it but

1115
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,300
is there anyone that would like to uh

1116
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,700
not not does not want us to try to

1117
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,440
recharter

1118
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,180
um that I would be interested in in why

1119
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,980
foreign

1120
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,819
so I think what we're going to do is

1121
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:13,680
we're going to proceed forward with the

1122
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,540
whip draft to get it out the door get a

1123
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,160
working group last call going

1124
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,800
then the chairs will set up a repo we

1125
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,180
will throw in the charter and we'll

1126
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,220
start editing it and we'll invite

1127
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,780
everyone to provide

1128
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,680
um

1129
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,540
issues and pull requests on the charter

1130
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,400
and then we will proceed forward

1131
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,099
and with that I think we'll draw this

1132
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,420
meeting to a close unless there's

1133
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,099
anybody else that has any other business

1134
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,420
that they would like to add at the last

1135
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,900
second here

1136
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,520
going once

1137
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,500
going twice

1138
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,900
sold as the Techno music starts to pound

1139
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,460
in the background

1140
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,619
everyone have a good night thank you

1141
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,260
very much

1142
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,200
thank you very much Sergio

1143
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,560
hey

1144
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,520
and thanks Niels for um helping me out

1145
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,900
with my network connection problems

1146
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
foreign

1147
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,400
thank you
