2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,780
least the honored we can also join the

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,420
full version if you want um so we have a

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,460
record that you've been here which is

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,400
important for this organization to work

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,820
um we do require a mask except you are

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,580
actively speaking at the mic or um in

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,580
front here and we do require to be nice

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,840
it's on the slide once again because

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,119
it's so important

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,540
this session will be recorded and will

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,399
be live streamed so we're exciting

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,520
foreign

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,700
this is a good opportunity for us the IB

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,739
to tell you what we're doing but it's

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,420
also a great opportunity to get input

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,640
from you on our work so that's the main

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,120
point here

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,500
um if you if you're just shy to go to my

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,879
clan today and tell us what we're doing

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,399
around you can also send us email

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,780
um there are different ways to reach us

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,360
you can reach um each of us individually

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,939
you can reach me at the IB chair but you

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,439
can also send us email to the IAB

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,299
mailing list but be aware it's not only

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,760
the IB on that list a few more people so

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,920
that's listed here if you want a more

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,420
public discussion especially on

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,740
architectural

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,299
um considerations we have the

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,180
architecture discuss list

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,159
um and we have lists for each program

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,320
which is only one at this point um that

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
you can engage with and if especially

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,100
one important role we're having is

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,259
liaison coordination so if you have a

38
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,240
question about liaison's um they have a

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,979
special mailing list for that so feel

40
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,259
free to reach us on any of these ways

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,680
okay before we start um the exciting

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,720
part of the meeting we have a few

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
updates that in order to keep you up to

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,220
date with what we're doing and one thing

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,899
we are doing is we do happen to publish

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,119
documents from time to time and we

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,100
happen and we published just two

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,159
documents which are both reports to um

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,500
recent workshops

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,479
so one is for the eight Workshop that we

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,740
had last year

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,199
and the other one is the workshop for

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,120
measuring Network quality for end users

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,980
we reported in both of these workshops

55
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,599
really nice workshops a lot of good

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,099
contributions and now you have to report

57
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,200
the final version of it out there as

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,599
obviously

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
um we're working also on documents that

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,319
are supposed to provide architecture

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,780
guidance and we have two documents that

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,660
are basically ready for publication

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,260
um

64
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,660
the past English collaboration document

65
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,540
already got a round of last round of

66
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,980
community feedback so this one is

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,080
actually ready to go and you will soon

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,519
see an RFC

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
and the protocol maintenance we will do

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,620
another round or like a final round of

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,480
community feedback but there was a lot

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,519
of work on this document lately so the

73
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,319
IB thinks this document is in very good

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,700
shape

75
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,140
um and you will see an email about this

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,940
soon or maybe it's already out I'm not

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,860
sure

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,379
and um just where we click quickly we

79
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,360
also have um two documents that we're

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,480
considering to adopt in the IAB

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
um one document we uh we already uh had

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
a presentation last iob open meeting so

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,099
you should be aware of this is the

84
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,260
minimization document we've got very

85
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,120
good feedback after the session there

86
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,519
has been a vision and mainly we're also

87
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,800
clarifying what the difference to the

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,440
system privacy considerations

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,420
because that also talks about data

90
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,159
minimization but we believe there's more

91
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,420
to say here

92
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,459
um so that's the status of that document

93
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,260
and the other one is brand new and I

94
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,519
will not tell you much about it because

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,840
we have a short presentation later

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,360
okay

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,000
um besides documents um we also have

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,940
this tool of technical programs that we

99
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,379
use to do work and engage with the

100
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,400
community

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,180
and currently we we just closed recently

102
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,560
and that was also discussed at the last

103
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,019
IB open meeting we closed Model T

104
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,819
working group

105
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,440
um it doesn't mean there's no work to be

106
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,200
done and we just think the work needs to

107
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,780
be done in the ITF but you can still use

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,000
the architecture discuss mainly if you

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,319
have anything to discuss in that

110
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,619
relation

111
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,139
and one active program we have is the

112
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,639
EDM program

113
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,260
um that program didn't have a meeting

114
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,418
since the last ITF meeting and but

115
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,400
there's the progress and mainly their

116
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,979
focus was on this protocol that I was

117
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,540
just talking on this document I was just

118
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,340
talking about about protocol maintenance

119
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,919
so that's the main focus

120
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,300
um but you can also see the current

121
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,759
status about other things that that will

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
be or our scope for this program and

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
based on GitHub issues so if you're

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,940
interested in in these things please

125
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,680
look at the issues please comment please

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,560
subscribe to the mailing list or talk to

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,199
the chairs you know we call them leads

128
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,199
which is David and Tommy David was just

129
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,680
waving

130
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,300
okay

131
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,020
um

132
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,600
liaison updates uh we will have a

133
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,580
slightly longer update coming up next

134
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,120
from Russ about uh IEEE this is

135
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,380
something we started the last meeting

136
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,300
that we actually asked one of our lizard

137
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,620
coordinators to talk about the

138
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,040
respective organization because we hope

139
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,620
that is helpful to the community

140
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,120
um and then just like one little news

141
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,580
here uh we one of our tasks is also to

142
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,460
maintain and these are managers so we

143
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,620
had Alison Menken who served us as a

144
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,800
lizard manager for a very long time

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,020
um and great thanks for that and she

146
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,940
asked us to step down and so we had to

147
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,639
find a replacement and so um Warren is

148
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,039
happily taking this up thank you thank

149
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,300
you to both Ellison Edward

150
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,560
okay the other thing we're doing is

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,020
workshops and we actually have something

152
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,500
coming up

153
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,000
um the next Workshop we are I'm going to

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,259
take you just missed the deadline

155
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,020
yesterday but if you actually want to

156
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,600
contribute maybe they're still intense I

157
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,479
don't know talk to to Yari and the other

158
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,759
program committee members

159
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,139
um but this Workshop is definitely

160
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,660
coming up uh beginning of December first

161
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,759
week of December and this will be an

162
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
online Workshop um so the the sessions

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,020
are not fixed yeah it depends on the

164
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,720
participants and the focus is really on

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
the environmental impact of the internet

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,979
to try to get an assessment or a better

167
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,539
understanding like how to even measure

168
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,940
that and what that means in very short

169
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,720
okay that was the quick update

170
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,720
um and we will next go to Russ except

171
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,520
somebody has an agenda badge that would

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,299
be your opportunity

173
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,539
got my slides oh yes

174
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,020
foreign

175
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,580
hi I'm here to talk about the

176
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,580
relationship between uh ITF and IEEE 802

177
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,419
next slide please

178
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,280
so this relationship

179
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
um is has been going on for a long long

180
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,500
time obviously but uh it got written

181
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,419
down uh in RFC 7241 which is actually an

182
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,419
update to an earlier RFC but it

183
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,400
describes the way that the two

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,819
organizations by Triple E project 802

185
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,220
and the ITF

186
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,539
um choose to cooperate

187
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,280
the document was collaboratively

188
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,180
developed from both people in the IEEE

189
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,639
802 leadership and from the iitf

190
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,240
leadership and it guides the way that we

191
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,639
do coordination today

192
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,419
next slide

193
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,340
so each uh

194
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,440
meeting cycle both the ITF and the IEEE

195
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,800
802 each meet three times a year

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
and so between each of the meetings so

197
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,479
roughly February June and October we

198
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,500
will have

199
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,960
kind of a coordination call to find out

200
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,379
what's going on with the other uh group

201
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,039
so 802 will present the things that they

202
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,559
are considering beginning work on these

203
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,899
are called project approval requests in

204
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,520
their terminology

205
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,700
and we will talk about the boff sessions

206
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,140
that are coming up

207
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,959
just basically to make sure that each of

208
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
us is aware of what's going on in the

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,320
other and not surprise each other

210
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
um and then we have a list of things

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
that are of mutual interest where we

212
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,720
want to collaborate so each time a

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,200
working group is formed or each time

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,640
um a uh project is begun on the 802 side

215
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,980
we ask the question is this a thing

216
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,800
where there's coordination needed

217
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,100
the further from the layer to layer

218
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,440
three boundary you are the less likely

219
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,480
they'll be coordination so if you're

220
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,160
down at the physical layer we're

221
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,019
probably not going to be talking about

222
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,660
this if you're at the application layer

223
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,160
it's probably not going to be on the

224
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,380
coordination list but the closer you get

225
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,300
to where the groups rub against each

226
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,660
other that's where where we talk

227
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,440
um

228
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,240
it's also

229
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,580
um when new projects get started they're

230
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,920
shared on the new work mail list

231
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,279
and we basically solicit reviews on

232
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,500
these calls as well

233
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,740
um hey this Topic's coming up make sure

234
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,839
that you take a look at that Charter

235
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,420
this documents become

236
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,660
um stable and we think you have an

237
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,720
interest in it please review

238
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,540
um and historically much of the

239
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,240
collaboration has actually fallen on

240
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,279
individuals who participate in both

241
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,120
groups I don't think that's unnatural

242
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,459
um and I think it's actually very

243
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,680
valuable and right now we have a couple

244
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,560
groups that straddle that line like the

245
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,800
detnet group has some dependencies on

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,040
the time sensitive networking work that

247
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,060
is going on in 802 and there are people

248
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,220
who are participating in both groups and

249
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,740
making sure that the information about

250
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,019
what one is doing is Flowing to the

251
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,279
other next slide please

252
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,019
so uh the liaison managers we have

253
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,180
several

254
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,360
I provide the liaison management from

255
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,180
the iitf to the IEEE standards

256
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,279
Association

257
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,700
uh Dorothy Stanley is uh who's actually

258
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,240
the chair of 802.11 was named as the

259
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,540
liaison uh from the full project 802

260
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,860
back to the ITF and Peter Yee um for the

261
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,680
just the Wi-Fi part

262
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,880
the guidance regarding these uh when to

263
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,339
do formal Liaisons as opposed to just

264
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,220
informal coordination

265
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,660
um from the ietf is is in BCP 103 and

266
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,200
there's a similar uh policy level

267
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,240
document in 802 at that URL

268
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,140
um

269
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,360
and there's two URLs if you want to

270
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,060
learn more about the way that the

271
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,700
collaboration is done and the minutes

272
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,300
from those collaboration calls and so on

273
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,899
next slide

274
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,079
so

275
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,399
um

276
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,920
protocol parameter out parameter

277
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,560
allocation goes on differently in the

278
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,600
two groups

279
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,079
Ayanna has to do with uh the way that we

280
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,820
would allocate a parameter and the um uh

281
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,220
Tripoli side they have the IEEE

282
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,100
registration Authority which has a

283
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,839
committee that oversees it called the

284
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,420
rack and I always think of that and

285
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,300
think about here in London the rack but

286
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,560
anyway

287
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,860
um the uh

288
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,720
they have an oversight group that does

289
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,260
the the technical side and

290
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,820
um we

291
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,680
um

292
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,339
have various Ianna parameter allocation

293
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,459
policies whenever it's a scarce resource

294
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,339
of course we require a standards action

295
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,019
when it's a bigger code space we have

296
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:58,500
less stringent rules and there are some

297
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,120
rules about there is an oui the top 24

298
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,899
bits of a MAC address assigned

299
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,420
and Diana has special rules for if you

300
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,079
need one of those how to get one

301
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,940
um there are a few Registries that are

302
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,220
are joint use

303
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,480
um

304
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,660
basically when a document it's

305
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,480
progressing through one of the two

306
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,160
bodies or the other needs a code point

307
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
from the other uh that's where we

308
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,660
coordinate to make sure an assignment

309
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,980
happens that makes sense next slide

310
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,100
so in summary the the two groups have a

311
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,160
great working relationship

312
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,660
informal Communications between the

313
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,180
leaders uh is really important because

314
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,459
then they know each other so whenever

315
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,540
some friction occurs basically they know

316
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,040
each other they can talk to each other

317
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,980
it helps a lot as opposed to the cold

318
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,360
call

319
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,300
um and these coordination sessions that

320
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,579
happen three times a year really do help

321
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,579
identify potential areas of uh

322
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,459
collaboration or friction the point just

323
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,040
to identify the both as early as

324
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,420
possible and when we do identify a place

325
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,540
where there is friction we have held

326
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,100
face-to-face meetings

327
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,740
um either a breakfast session at an ITF

328
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,260
or a session at the an 802 meeting and

329
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,940
occasionally we have meetings in the

330
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,459
same place in back-to-back weeks and

331
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,100
when that happens we make sure the

332
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,620
leadership gets to spend a little bit of

333
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,079
time together so again that they end

334
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,600
know each other

335
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,199
Juan Carlos go ahead yes hi Russ sorry I

336
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,500
was trying to get on the cue but yeah

337
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,779
but now you're talking already by eight

338
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,820
or two at 11 connection was fake

339
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,820
uh just just want to make a comment

340
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,440
about an example of one of those

341
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,240
coordinations because we've been talking

342
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,519
through this week with the rack with

343
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,100
Roger and Glenn about a specific point

344
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,680
of coordination regarding the the IEEE

345
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,139
802 numbering okay and we will have some

346
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,260
discussions uh at the interior this week

347
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,180
so for people that are interested and

348
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,399
seeing a real life example of one of

349
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,740
these coordinations we will Lively

350
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,199
discuss uh exactly how to best

351
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
coordinate this Ayanna registry with the

352
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,399
highee 802 registry and solving

353
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,680
incoherences that we are finding out and

354
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,240
some opportunities to make it work

355
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,660
better okay so if anyone is interested

356
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,880
in major types another topic where

357
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,920
there's been a lot of collaboration of

358
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,440
late is on Yang modules correct making

359
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,680
sure that uh when 802 develops one that

360
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,579
the Yang doctors review it and so on so

361
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,459
it's I'm glad it's working Barry hearing

362
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,440
Cube

363
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,260
yeah this is Barry Leiber just to give

364
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,199
people an idea of how how mature this is

365
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,240
and how long it's been going on how long

366
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,459
have the coordination meetings been

367
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,819
happening

368
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,660
uh there's been 30 some of them that's

369
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,660
all I could remember so at roughly uh

370
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,160
quite quite some years yeah exactly

371
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,720
I did close the queue because we don't

372
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,420
have a lot of time but we take we take

373
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,820
you food okay yeah yeah uh well

374
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,440
coordination's good

375
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,040
but

376
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,120
I remember

377
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,860
the first uh Wi-Fi security holes

378
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,019
being identified

379
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,680
and then it was like five years before

380
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,660
those were fixed

381
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,740
and then another 15 years before they

382
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,100
were really fixed

383
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,279
and I'm still trying to connect up to my

384
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,480
manage my Wi-Fi devices in the house

385
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,119
and I'm still not seeing Solutions out

386
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,179
of Wi-Fi world

387
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,780
and I think that we should not be too

388
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,939
deferential

389
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,140
if a group is not delivering for the end

390
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,500
users of the internet

391
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,799
and not providing a specification that

392
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,620
is actually usable

393
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,360
then at some point we've got to say

394
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,940
we're just going to do it ourselves

395
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,460
and if we don't say it here somebody

396
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,780
else will

397
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,299
so there are some examples where we have

398
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,559
done that

399
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,660
um after coordination

400
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,660
um like uh Warren had the captive portal

401
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,260
uh Group which was uh

402
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,840
intended to solve a small piece of that

403
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,799
problem

404
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,280
and and certainly I think we have other

405
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,860
examples but uh

406
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,580
I would discourage just grabbing a space

407
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,400
without talking so that you know you're

408
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,080
grabbing a particular piece of the

409
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,200
problem uh when we surprise each other

410
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,880
is when things get most ugly

411
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,740
yeah thank you that's a very good last

412
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,419
sentence if you have more questions

413
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,640
about IEEE talk to Russ or if you have

414
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,140
questions about liaison talk to us the

415
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,000
IB

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,860
um and we're rushing towards giving us a

417
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,780
report about one of our latest workshops

418
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,760
yep so we just held a workshop this will

419
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,380
be really short uh because you should go

420
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,820
watch the Youtube videos rather than

421
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,220
listen to me try and summarize it but we

422
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,380
had a workshop on managing encrypted

423
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,940
networks uh I think it went off

424
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,500
fantastically it was sort of three days

425
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,400
long

426
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,080
the purpose of the workshop you know is

427
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,340
there on the slide that's sort of the

428
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,960
most important sentence that says this

429
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,240
Workshop was to discuss how do we

430
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,220
improve Network management as encryption

431
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,960
kind of keeps ramping and ramping up on

432
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,580
the Internet which is both good for end

433
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,799
users but it does make some things like

434
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,480
traffic prioritization and other

435
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,700
management techniques difficult

436
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,280
so we divided the workshop into three

437
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,720
different two-hour sessions they were

438
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,100
two hours each day from a Monday to

439
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,320
Wednesday the first one was you know

440
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,600
where do we go where are we now how does

441
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,860
the world exist

442
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,480
um what are the requirements and passive

443
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,760
observations uh the second one is where

444
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,380
do we want to go right what do we want

445
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,660
where do we want to get to uh what are

446
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,160
the collaboration principles and then

447
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,260
the final uh day was on how do we get

448
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,460
there what are what are like the future

449
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,140
thinking how do we how do we actually

450
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,740
make progress next

451
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,380
so the result was uh an excellent three

452
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,360
days as I said there was roughly 35

453
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
participants every day roughly I think

454
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
it was a little bit less on each day but

455
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,900
it rolled a little bit and the topics

456
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,640
and presentations included you know a

457
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,140
lot of things I listed sort of four

458
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,360
bullets out of a bunch of stuff there

459
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,820
was um a number of talks that were given

460
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,860
and a lot of discussion and they're all

461
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,360
available on YouTube as I said that'll

462
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,940
be on the next slide um but how do we

463
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,640
you know manage encrypted traffic

464
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,419
um

465
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,400
sorry

466
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,260
um you know how do we do this in a data

467
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,400
center kind of world there was actually

468
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,960
a good talk about how it actually is

469
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,360
being done in a data center World

470
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,980
um what are the benefits and motivation

471
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,660
for collaboration and I think to me

472
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,400
that's one of the biggest takeaways how

473
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,380
can we get end users to actually tell

474
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,059
their isps what they need when they're

475
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,919
encrypting their traffic in a way that's

476
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,679
safe for them so that's actually

477
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,640
um so there was there was a bunch of

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,020
good proposals for doing that all right

479
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,559
now you can go on

480
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,960
uh so this is sort of the final list I

481
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,640
should say the one thing that I forgot

482
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,620
to put on these list is uh thank you to

483
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,120
the program committee so I will do that

484
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,220
now the program committee you know

485
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,539
consisted of mattering notable and

486
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,120
amiria kudwin uh Tommy Paulie Russ white

487
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,160
and and Chi Wu

488
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,140
um so thank you to all of those members

489
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,700
and then the YouTube recordings are

490
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,500
there they're only two hours each so you

491
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,760
can put them on fast forward if you want

492
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,559
and uh you'll learn a lot from them so I

493
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,240
suggest you look at them

494
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,919
thanks Luis thanks to all the

495
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,539
participants for that Workshop

496
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,940
and thanks in advance for those people

497
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,679
who will be writing the report so

498
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,720
hopefully that's coming up soon

499
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,020
okay next presentation we have told me I

500
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,139
believe

501
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,860
yeah and somehow this is not working

502
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,840
all right hello uh yeah if you could

503
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,480
approve the slide sharing

504
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,120
yeah

505
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,239
thank you

506
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,660
Tommy I can't answer can you try to

507
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,360
share to request sharing

508
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,760
I I am requesting

509
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,340
I am requesting I think you just need to

510
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,419
hit

511
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,480
oh it says you're offline now

512
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,720
that's great

513
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,860
about the queue then was the secret

514
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,860
perfect

515
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,500
all right

516
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,700
hey everyone

517
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,480
um

518
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,640
I'll just give a five minute rundown on

519
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,980
a new document we have published we

520
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,539
haven't discussed it much on list yet

521
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,179
but this is a early preview of it

522
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,240
and it's talking about partitioning as

523
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,820
an emerging architecture we see uh in

524
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,679
the space of uh protocols that are

525
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,140
trying to enhance privacy

526
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,580
and so I've been working on this with

527
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,220
miria as well as Chris Wood who has been

528
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,320
contributing as a non-hiab member

529
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
so overall

530
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,580
we observed that many generally newer

531
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,820
groups within ietf are trying to improve

532
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,640
user privacy based on separating data

533
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,760
out between different entities

534
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,960
uh this is kind of core to what Ojai is

535
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,679
doing for oblivious HTTP it's uh one of

536
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,500
the reasons that motivates mask which is

537
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,100
doing uh HTTP based proxies that can

538
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,460
proxy UDP and IP traffic

539
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,980
it's very fundamental to PPM which is a

540
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,299
meeting going on right now about

541
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,100
collecting metrics and splitting them up

542
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,480
between different entities before

543
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,220
rejoining data

544
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,900
and it's also fundamental to privacy

545
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,919
pass

546
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,940
which is all about being able to

547
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,480
uh authenticate or prove some property

548
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,900
about a client using uh information and

549
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,419
attestation from a different path or a

550
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,960
different entity

551
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,640
so these have many different use cases

552
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,520
but they all benefit in a privacy aspect

553
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,220
from partitioning so this can be about

554
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,500
separating out client IP addresses from

555
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,260
the user data you can be separating user

556
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,900
authorization from actual content access

557
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,179
like in privacy pass

558
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,159
or it can be separating the client

559
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,900
identities from metrics

560
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,840
so partitioning for privacy is an

561
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,340
emerging architecture pattern that we

562
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,080
see so we think it's something that we

563
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,780
should comment on and help explain

564
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,000
because you know collectively as a ITF

565
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Community we need to work on ways to

566
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,080
discuss analyze and evaluate these

567
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,600
protocols and what they have in common

568
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,740
because we don't think this is a pattern

569
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,480
that's going to go away but it's

570
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,919
something that we don't have a lot of

571
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,500
language for already

572
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,080
so you can read the document as a high

573
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,059
level it's talking about privacy

574
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,460
contexts as the things that are

575
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,559
partitioned where a context is a group

576
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,480
of entities that share

577
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,740
us a common view of data and metadata

578
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,080
and So within a context the data and

579
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,020
identifiers are all correlatable and all

580
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,100
shared

581
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,840
and so in order to partition data you

582
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,539
need to split contexts and that happens

583
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,000
either through encryption or through

584
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,380
literally just having separate

585
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,900
connections over space or time

586
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,059
and those two building blocks are what

587
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,159
go into making all of those different

588
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,419
protocols that we mentioned before

589
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,360
so for example in oblivious HTTP uh you

590
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,340
end up with various different contexts

591
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,400
of uh who can see what based on

592
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,140
different encryption boundaries

593
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,880
this is just one of the examples we go

594
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,280
through in the document

595
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
and so out of this we think there are a

596
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
lot of interesting observations we can

597
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,980
make that

598
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,100
um you know first partitioning is just a

599
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,659
tool it's a building block that we see

600
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,640
it's not a Panacea it doesn't mean that

601
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,760
you're private by default there's a lot

602
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,039
of Reliance on non-collusion and you

603
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,480
have to make sure that you're selecting

604
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,820
the boundaries of what is in your

605
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,799
context and who is in your context very

606
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,500
carefully to have a good effect

607
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,059
um we talk a bit about the impacts on

608
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,640
manageability of data

609
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,679
um we mentioned that it's important to

610
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,840
think about performance and also the

611
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,580
fact that

612
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,539
um

613
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,159
there are still attacks that you can do

614
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,380
by looking at traffic analysis and other

615
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,059
patterns to understand what data is

616
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,620
going on so this is only part of the

617
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,918
puzzle

618
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,900
so in conclusion please read the

619
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,720
document provide input this is early but

620
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,480
uh we think it's going to be a important

621
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,240
contribution to future work in the ITF

622
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,220
thank you

623
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,200
foreign and if there are any questions

624
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,080
right now happy to hear them

625
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,179
yeah thanks

626
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,380
stop two seconds

627
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,279
anybody wants to jump in

628
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,720
we have one

629
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,880
can I

630
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,679
okay

631
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,640
exchange I think you know what I'm going

632
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,980
to say but yeah I think that well this

633
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,260
is an important discussion but then I

634
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,880
mean depending on how this is deployed

635
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,440
and designed on the economic incentives

636
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,620
on the policies and so on Technical and

637
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,600
not technical parts of it this might

638
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,700
actually provoke more centralization and

639
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,100
less privacy than actually distribute

640
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,600
and create more privacy so it depends

641
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,460
whether you build this architecture in a

642
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,900
way so that you have one Million Parts

643
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,900
through which you can choose I mean but

644
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,400
if you're just creating something which

645
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,620
is so hard to deploy that only three

646
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,000
companies on the plant will actually

647
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,460
provide this intermediate service or

648
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,020
whatever then the result will be

649
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,720
centralization and less privacy so I'm I

650
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,100
think we'll have the discussion but I

651
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,840
just wanted to flag the issue that it

652
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,880
really depends on how you design and how

653
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,440
you deployed it in terms of incentives

654
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,940
not just technical ones but also

655
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,700
economic and policy ones yeah thank you

656
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,520
and I think that's exactly the type of

657
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,799
uh commentary and discussion that

658
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,360
belongs in this document so it can say

659
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,700
Hey you know just because your

660
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,679
partitioning data doesn't mean that it's

661
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,360
always the right thing to do or you need

662
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,620
to be careful in how you do it

663
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,140
okay perfect this document was just a

664
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,840
zero zero version posted um and if you

665
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,460
want to provide more comments uh you

666
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,500
will see a call for feedback

667
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,659
or a call yeah that's kind of how we

668
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,620
call it we call it differently it

669
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,360
doesn't matter you can comment on the

670
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,580
architect to discuss list okay let's

671
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,500

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,760
come on we've got your

682
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,980

yeah happy too

687
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,400
so can you can you request sharing and

688
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,659
select your slides because then you can

689
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,039
control them yourself I requested

690
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,100
uh I uh

691
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,299
that's better

692
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,580
okay I just did

693
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,299
okay

694
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,820
so

695
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,620
I don't see any change in the UI though

696
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,620
uh

697
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,340
you can do a request or we can progress

698
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,860
them for you

699
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,740

actually is uh uh yeah now now my own

702
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,179
presentation that's cool okay uh so

703
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,299
let's start thanks for inviting me here

704
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,720
uh I'm Simone I work at Uni uh here what

705
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,659
I'm going to provide you is a bird view

706
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:31,919
of this report that we wrote about a

707
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,320
surgeon censorship in Iran

708
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,380
um during the first weeks of the Maza

709
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,539
amini protests

710
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:43,740
um so uh let's see okay I can also

711
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,140
progress slides fantastic okay I will

712
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,500
first to tell you what we are so we are

713
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,240
a free software product who needs a free

714
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,960
software project we started in 2012 and

715
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,539
um what we do basically is to provide

716
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,640
people with tools that they can install

717
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,059
on their phones or or on their desktops

718
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,179
or command line tools with which it can

719
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,539
run tasks from the address from their

720
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,539
own tools from their own computers uh to

721
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,140
measure censorship and then those data

722
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,600
is submitted to us and we publish it and

723
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,960
since 2012 we um covered more than 200

724
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,940
countries and published more than a

725
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,899
billion measurements and yeah the the

726
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,820
way in which many users interacts with

727
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,120
the tool is that it's a mobile app or a

728
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,640
desktop where you can choose categories

729
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,000
of tasks to run so for example in this

730
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,320
presentation I'm going to show you

731
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,659
results from the websites

732
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,360
um kind of tasks where there is a set

733
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,500
fuels that we choose and that we um

734
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,740
basically we track four when the task is

735
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,360
running but we also test instant

736
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,820
messaging apps by tracking services that

737
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,500
are relevant to them so those are the

738
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,260
two most important uh group of tasks

739
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,620
that we uh we are going to discuss

740
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,860
um then like what happens is that users

741
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,340
runs the uniprobe tool and then submit

742
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,620
measurements to our backend which is the

743
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,140
gray thing in there and then eventually

744
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,940
we have an API to access the

745
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,640
measurements and

746
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,380
the uh there is a website called uni

747
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,720
Explorer which allows to see individual

748
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
measurements or to group measurements

749
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,059
together produce charts Etc and that

750
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,340
creates value for researchers including

751
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,620
us and users that want to explore all of

752
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,380
that in particular we have this tool

753
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,299
called map management aggregation

754
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,620
toolkit which is allows anyone to

755
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,020
produce charts and those charts

756
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,360
basically are the charts that I'm going

757
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,279
to use that we used in the original

758
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,340
reports so uh that's the tool and and

759
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,399
yeah you can uh basically reproduce the

760
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,260
charts that I'm going to show for

761
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,460
yourself using this tool so now that I

762
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,320
have set this stage let's uh so let's

763
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,659
enter into the report itself

764
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,059
slash reports on our website is the

765
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,860
directory where we publish all our

766
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,440
reports the specific one that I'm going

767
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,919
to tell you the high level results of is

768
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,620
this uh one on uh like on Iran after the

769
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,299
um a few weeks after the beginning of

770
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,640
the protest we actually finished it on

771
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,419
the 25th of September and

772
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:37,919
um so let's uh uh before before I I show

773
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,740
you some of our results let's say that

774
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,100
uh as you probably already know uh there

775
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,380
was lots of censorship in Iran before

776
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,880
and there were a few a few services that

777
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,059
were available and the I like the tldr

778
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:57,000
of this report is that the situation

779
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,620
um

780
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,260
became worst uh quite worst but but

781
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,059
still it's important to remember the

782
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,940
starting point was not good at all

783
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,500
um so let's for example uh start to to

784
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,720
see one of the charts that we included

785
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,419
into the report this is about DNS over

786
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,880
https and

787
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,940
there are rows in this chart each row is

788
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,140
a service that you can use to Doh and

789
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,880
then uh each bar is a uh the the height

790
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,019
of each bar is the number of

791
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,720
measurements we collected in a single

792
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,539
day in Iran and then there are those

793
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,059
colors it's a stock plot so basically

794
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,820
the um the amount of a color that you

795
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,039
see is the percentage of that color on

796
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,340
that day uh okay green is obvious so

797
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,679
nothing to say here then we have these

798
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,580
two

799
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,519
um colors that are red and yellow and

800
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,640
red is confirmed what this means is that

801
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,059
there are signatures we and other people

802
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,620
doing research on this field as

803
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,440
collected over time that you can find

804
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,679
for example in HTTP bodies or in the DNS

805
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,399
replies that are

806
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,760
a clear indication of censorship and

807
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,260
when we see those signatures uh the

808
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,839
measurement is flagged as confirmed now

809
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,099
in the case of Iran where all like Iran

810
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,980
is many many are private IP addresses

811
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,199
inside the country and there are a few

812
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,020
of them a few of those bobans that are

813
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,000
well known to be associated with

814
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
censoring

815
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,379
um so when when we in this specific case

816
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,599
when we found those backgrounds we said

817
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,800
right okay this measurement really uh

818
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,619
direct attempt of sensory uh then yellow

819
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,520
is mostly unexpected network errors so

820
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,660
uh cases that you uh will see in Iran

821
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,900
are most often uh you perform at the

822
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,880
last hand track but you time out during

823
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,640
the entry and there is some filtering

824
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,359
that depends on the client to know uh or

825
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,720
the endpoints that that will use that

826
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,660
cause the handshake to timeout or in

827
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,520
other case that is frequent in Iran is

828
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,980
that utcp conduct but you come out

829
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,079
because the connect never turned it so

830
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,660
those are the yellow cases that we see

831
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,820
here

832
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,099
um like without going too much in depth

833
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,320
but just to say that

834
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,940
um we know by inspecting the

835
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,060
measurements that what we had was a

836
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,940
superimposition of uh anomalies and

837
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,880
confirmed so for example uh you see that

838
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,200
there that there are these three

839
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,480
services that were already filling with

840
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,980
anomalies and those anomalies were

841
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,500
mostly tell us and traits now

842
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,119
um

843
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:53,339
it turned rather turned to confirmed on

844
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,800
the 21st and this is basically the

845
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,960
pattern so uh we can see the same

846
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,200
pattern across other kind of services so

847
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,260
WhatsApp was working before and this is

848
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,660
notable because uh signal for example

849
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,720
was tampered with in Iran before and

850
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,000
also telegram was and WhatsApp installed

851
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,980
was working and there we have a bunch of

852
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,540
services that are relevant to WhatsApp

853
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,200
and they on the 21st again turn the allo

854
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,660
starting and anomalies

855
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,300
um the same open for Instagram which was

856
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,160
one of the few social networks that was

857
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,140
still working in the country and again

858
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,800
on the 21st uh those many services that

859
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,740
are useful uh to Instagram they became

860
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,760
basically uh anomalies so mostly

861
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,040
tls-centric timing out

862
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,300
um so about stores uh the stores like

863
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,520
for book apple and

864
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,160
Google's Play Store what happened is

865
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,339
that I it started not working a few days

866
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,920
later and what what happened is that

867
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,579
they the censorship was mainly targeting

868
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,320
the services that are useful to install

869
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,900
applications but the rest was working so

870
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,240
for example here for India um for the

871
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,599
App Store after a certain hour of the 20

872
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,320
second all tasks start failing and

873
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,680
providing these confirmed results and

874
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,420
the same happened for the Play Store

875
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,940
where play.googleapps.com seems to be

876
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,800
very important for installing new

877
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,780
applications and yeah the rest was

878
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,540
mostly working but yeah this prevented

879
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,119
people from installing applications and

880
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,040
finally LinkedIn

881
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,920
similar story but shifted a little bit

882
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,680
in time after a certain moment in time

883
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,520
it starts not working so to summarize on

884
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,680
top of an already a big uh like uh

885
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,680
censorship condition uh people from Iran

886
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,680
started not being able to use DNS server

887
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,200
https which reduced their opportunities

888
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,160
to that good IP addresses and then the

889
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,520
instant messaging tool that was working

890
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,800
started having issues and then social

891
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
networks such as uh LinkedIn and

892
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,800
Instagram were not working anymore and

893
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,680
stores from which you can install tools

894
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,700
like siphon or Lantern or Tor to

895
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,099
circumvent circumvention they were not

896
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,920
working anymore so basically yeah this

897
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,320
is what we observed at the beginning of

898
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,780
the process thank you

899
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,000
thanks a lot Simona

900
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,760
um so we're going to wait until the end

901
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,160
of our invited talks are finished for

902
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,320
questions and so we'll go ahead and

903
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,140
invite Masa up so Masa works at the um

904
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,420
Article 19 which is

905
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,820
um I just for disclosure purposes I used

906
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,980
to work there as well um she's also a

907
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,440
senior researcher in the Mina region at

908
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,619
um at the University of Oxford as a PhD

909
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,720
candidate so we're really excited to

910
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,619
have her come up to talk more about what

911
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:04,980
activists are seeing on the ground as

912
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,660
um you know folks are actually dealing

913
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,599
with these shutdowns and we also have

914
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,880
her slide so we're going to give you

915
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,980
we've given you a little bit of a more

916
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,960
technical view of what the shutdowns are

917
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,640
looking like and this is just more of

918
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,920
the the real human side of things as

919
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,640
well

920
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,460
um and so I'll yeah let Masa go ahead

921
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,180
and you can just let us know what to

922
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,160
change yeah sure

923
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,700
um hi everyone uh

924
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,320
okay yeah like uh Mallory said I work at

925
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,839
Article 19 I'm a senior researcher

926
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,480
focusing on the Mina region

927
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,140
and um for the past seven weeks

928
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,780
um I guess uh our teams working on Iran

929
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,440
have been full on working on this issue

930
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,000
um some people call this a revolution

931
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,440
because

932
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,140
um things have changed drastically and

933
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,880
you know it's a bit unprecedented to see

934
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,579
a protest movement like this uh continue

935
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,339
on for such a long period of time and

936
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,920
Technology obviously plays a really big

937
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,540
role

938
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,060
um so the last time we saw something on

939
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,520
this scale was back during November of

940
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,560
2019 in Iran

941
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,300
um of course uh protests have been

942
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,619
continuous

943
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,359
um they I mean even before this round

944
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,579
there were protests in different

945
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,640
provinces over different issues like

946
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,339
um you know water crises food crises and

947
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,380
things like that

948
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,460
um and

949
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,320
every time there are internet

950
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,839
disruptions and there is some sort of

951
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,300
restrictions on access

952
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,040
um online

953
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,180
um so the largest scale of shutdowns we

954
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,700
saw was during November 2019 and so for

955
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,820
a period of over a week

956
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,980
the entire country kind of

957
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,640
um

958
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,680
essentially went offline from the

959
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,020
international internet there was access

960
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,520
to

961
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,579
um you know National internet services

962
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,020
um and so you know some of you might

963
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,240
have heard of November 2019 in terms of

964
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,220
what they did

965
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,099
um clearly the digital repression was

966
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,280
accompanied by you know offline severe

967
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
brutality

968
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,920
um uh

969
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,859
the difficulty in documenting um how

970
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,140
many people were killed in the darkness

971
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,760
of the shutdowns

972
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,480
um has been uh obviously has meant that

973
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,760
we don't know the exact figures Amnesty

974
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,900
International has verified something

975
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,540
around 300 people who have died but

976
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,820
estimates say they're actually closer to

977
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,160
1500 people were killed by authorities

978
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,099
while protesting

979
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:45,300
um and you know there's been a lot of

980
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,700
research by Article 19 and Amnesty

981
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,200
International to show that you know

982
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,320
these crimes against life uh were

983
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,300
largely facilitated by internet shutdown

984
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,440
so

985
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
um these technical discussions uh have

986
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,200
very real uh impact on you know just the

987
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,820
right to life and the right to protest

988
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,720
in Iran so um at Article 19 we did

989
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,460
really in-depth research to kind of look

990
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,140
at the anatomy of what happened during

991
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,760
2019.

992
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,560
um even though there was a kind of

993
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,200
international shutdown there wasn't kind

994
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,000
of an off switch

995
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,520
um and so there's a map behind me of

996
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,280
what the internet looked like in 2019 in

997
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,119
terms of how isps uh were organized

998
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,119
um so basically what we see is there

999
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,160
wasn't necessarily A centralization on

1000
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,800
how the internet was shut off but there

1001
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,320
has been a centralization in terms of

1002
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,140
how isps are organized and so most

1003
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,359
civilian connections if you can see up

1004
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,940
there in the blue originate from the

1005
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,440
Telecommunications infrastructure

1006
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,440
company of Iran and so there is you know

1007
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,300
a communication regulatory Authority

1008
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,900
that tells the various isps what kind of

1009
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,540
restrictions they have to place

1010
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,240
um on their users and so

1011
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,160
um you know the level of shutdowns

1012
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,800
occurred really at the ISP levels

1013
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,140
um uh in that way

1014
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,819
um and so you know our research did

1015
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,380
indicate that despite you know the

1016
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,119
centralization and governance there

1017
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,740
hasn't necessarily been a centralization

1018
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,220
an infrastructure after 2019 there were

1019
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,900
continued growth in you know internet

1020
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,599
exchange points facilitating more

1021
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,560
connections to the international

1022
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,200
internet so despite the fact that you

1023
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,579
know there has been a lot of talk about

1024
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,920
how Iran is trying to nationalize its

1025
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,680
internet or move towards a kind of North

1026
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,760
Korean national internet infrastructure

1027
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,740
um it is still you know investing in

1028
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,300
international connections so that's

1029
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,240
interesting so this brings me to what's

1030
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,480
happening now next slide

1031
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,220
um so there were a lot of lessons

1032
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,740
learned from 2019

1033
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,260
um in terms of what these shutdowns did

1034
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,020
for the Iranian economy clearly there

1035
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,060
were billions of dollars lost to the

1036
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,760
Iranian economy in 2019 when there was a

1037
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,160
week like week-long shut down from the

1038
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,500
international internet and so

1039
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,540
um like every kind of protest crisis

1040
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,900
that has occurred in this uh country

1041
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,180
um there has been a period of very deep

1042
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,160
thought and development by authorities

1043
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,640
in terms of Lessons Learned and 2019 was

1044
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,460
one of these periods and so one of the

1045
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,920
reflections was how to make

1046
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,440
uh digital repression essentially more

1047
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,020
efficient and less costly for the

1048
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,579
government and one of the means that

1049
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,760
really was developed was the policies

1050
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,800
and Technical

1051
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,079
um underpinnings of this particular bill

1052
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,180
that's called the user protection bill

1053
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,060
or in Persian it's called tadhesionette

1054
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,359
and of course the user protection bill

1055
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:47,400
is not necessarily to protect Iranian

1056
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,680
users it's more to protect Iranian

1057
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,200
authorities and really leave Iranian

1058
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,060
users vulnerable

1059
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,980
um and so there are a number of

1060
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,800
different you know Draconian articles

1061
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,260
within this bill this bill is so

1062
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,420
unpopular that even really conservative

1063
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,000
Hardline elements in Iran like Iran's

1064
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,900
you know student besiege forces have

1065
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,480
um you know protested this bill and you

1066
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,040
know student besiege are some of the

1067
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,619
most Hardline

1068
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:18,480
authoritarian groups in Iran um and so

1069
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,640
there's deep unpopularity about the bill

1070
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,500
because it's going to severely hurt the

1071
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,619
economy however this hasn't stopped the

1072
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:27,960
fact that there has been a silent

1073
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,760
implementation of a lot of the policies

1074
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,480
in the bill and one of the I mean

1075
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,040
there's a lot of different elements from

1076
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,540
the fact that they want to centralize

1077
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,520
internet exchange points into the hands

1078
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,339
of the Armed Forces but one of the

1079
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,839
points in the bill that has been

1080
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,640
particularly significant and you know

1081
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,319
our colleagues at Uni also pointed out

1082
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,960
to is this element where they want to

1083
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,480
criminalize the sale of vpns and

1084
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,119
essentially disable technically disable

1085
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,359
the use of vpns and they want to build a

1086
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,079
kind of model of legal vpns where the

1087
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,660
government facilitates different kind

1088
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,579
different tiers of access to different

1089
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,040
individuals in Iran based on their

1090
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,839
profession based on their Identity or

1091
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,599
connections to have these legal vpns

1092
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,920
that essentially gives you know

1093
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,500
whitelists for internet access as

1094
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,240
opposed to You Know The Blacklist that

1095
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,720
currently exists and so how does the

1096
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,099
government go about technically

1097
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,579
disabling access to vpns and so at

1098
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,260
Article 19 we had been trying to

1099
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,720
understand how this is happening and so

1100
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,020
as far back as October 2021 we started

1101
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,940
seeing evidence of you know very

1102
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,420
sophisticated development of this kind

1103
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,880
of technology so during October 2021

1104
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,040
there wasn't necessarily any protests in

1105
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,079
Iran there wasn't necessarily any events

1106
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,720
but there was severe disruptions

1107
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,839
occurring on the Iranian Network and so

1108
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,700
when we did a deep dive into it and

1109
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,800
talked to network Engineers inside Iran

1110
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,339
it seemed like there was

1111
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:01,740
you know a specific focus on tampering

1112
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,680
and disconnecting VPN protocols and so

1113
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,480
there's actually

1114
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,520
um you know a testimony from a network

1115
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,440
engineer we spoke to

1116
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,619
where he was saying that basically the

1117
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:15,359
health of the network was severely

1118
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,400
deteriorating at that point as they were

1119
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,440
testing these different

1120
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,180
um forms of what seemed like the packet

1121
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,359
inspection against the circumvention

1122
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,400
methods so

1123
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,319
um it did seem like they were really

1124
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,900
working on this effort if you go to the

1125
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,920
next slide

1126
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,500
and of course this now brings us to

1127
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,619
right now so since September 16 when

1128
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,160
Masa or Gina amini died after being in

1129
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,619
custody with the morality police we

1130
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,140
immediately saw protests they started at

1131
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,240
her Hospital in Tehran on the 16th and

1132
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,760
they spread to be National protests by

1133
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,040
the 17th and they've basically continued

1134
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,260
on until right this very minute

1135
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,680
and so this is pretty historic and

1136
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,660
unprecedented in terms of the length of

1137
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,060
protests and the various different

1138
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,839
techniques we have seen are very new and

1139
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,760
I think talk to the fact that

1140
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,859
authorities had been planning for a

1141
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:12,540
moment like this and planning on these

1142
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,000
different methods to try to reduce the

1143
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,020
kind of costs to the economy to how the

1144
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,660
nation functions and so there's been

1145
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,000
really four techniques we've been

1146
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,940
noticing mobile curfews Iran like a lot

1147
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,400
of countries internet access is mostly

1148
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,000
facilitated through mobile internet data

1149
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,099
and so it's very significant and

1150
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:38,280
protests typically surge around 4 P.M

1151
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,180
between 4 P.M and 1 am and so the major

1152
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,180
um if you go to the next slide some of

1153
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,119
the major mobile carriers in Iran up

1154
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,540
here we have Iran cell reitel and Hamra

1155
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,280
Ava these are the most used mobile

1156
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,520
carriers in Iran and you can see by

1157
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,319
um this period of time during these

1158
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,380
protests we have clear moments where um

1159
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,240
you know there's mobile curfews and you

1160
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,760
know after the mobile curfews and we can

1161
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,579
see a surge in Mobile use

1162
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,140
um next slide

1163
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,599
and so another uh thing we've been

1164
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,160
seeing although we haven't been seeing

1165
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,859
National shutdowns we've been seeing you

1166
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:21,660
know select days where internet is shut

1167
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,540
down in specific regions where there's

1168
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,540
the highest protest brutality this is a

1169
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,180
snippet from one day uh from October 8th

1170
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,339
to the 9th in the province of Kurdistan

1171
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:35,099
Masa amini was from Kurdistan so there's

1172
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,900
been a lot of days like this where the

1173
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,660
internet is shut and you know others

1174
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,640
other provinces where historically

1175
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,800
marginalized groups like The baluchis

1176
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,319
the avazis and the Kurds are have been

1177
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,440
seeing a lot of days like this

1178
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,859
um and accompanied usually by massacres

1179
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,720
um so like I mentioned I think the

1180
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,960
biggest and most concerning aspect we're

1181
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,119
seeing is how they are attacking

1182
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:01,920
circumvention technology at the moment

1183
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,900
and of course this is really important

1184
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,819
because

1185
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,740
um you know within the first few days of

1186
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,500
the protests most remaining and most

1187
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,700
popular

1188
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,079
um foreign

1189
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:15,660
internet services were blocked so

1190
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,940
Instagram was the most used social media

1191
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,920
in Iran it was blocked within a few days

1192
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,900
of the protests

1193
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,460
um WhatsApp was blocked within the first

1194
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,380
few days of the protest and slowly most

1195
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,140
as our colleagues at Uni said most

1196
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,260
foreign services or really any kind of

1197
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,900
Foreign Service where communication or

1198
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,940
coordination could occur has been

1199
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,440
blocked

1200
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,079
um and so this also is part of the

1201
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,420
overall plans that were in place for the

1202
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,680
bill

1203
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,420
um and not only did they do this but

1204
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,339
they blocked the App Store so when they

1205
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:49,440
blocked app stores like Google Play

1206
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,260
Store and Apple App Store this means

1207
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,500
that when you know the existing vpns are

1208
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,960
disabled it's very hard there's a new

1209
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,780
hurdle in getting new functional and

1210
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,140
secure vpns Iran is well known for

1211
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,839
having you know National vpns that are

1212
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,700
well known to be operated by authorities

1213
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,000
who monitor or you know pick up data

1214
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,359
from the vpns that they make themselves

1215
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,900
so secure vpns is a major issue and we

1216
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,180
have noted that there's a large majority

1217
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,980
of Iranians are using kind of national

1218
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,660
vpns where the security is very shady

1219
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,900
um and so uh like I mentioned and like

1220
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,240
um our uni colleagues also alluded to

1221
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,819
there has been different kind of

1222
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:37,740
um evidences of what they're doing to

1223
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,800
make circumvention really difficult

1224
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,240
um so you know we're guessing there's

1225
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,700
very sophisticated the packet inspection

1226
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,740
we've also seen increased blocking of

1227
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,859
encrypted DNS and you know complete

1228
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:53,220
blocking of HTTP 3 and quick traffic

1229
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,680
um I'm not a particularly you know um

1230
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,960
technical person into the fine-graining

1231
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,420
of this but I'm sure a lot of people in

1232
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,760
this room are aware of this so

1233
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,900
um these are some of the things that

1234
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,940
we've been seeing

1235
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,700
um next slide so this essentially brings

1236
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,460
us to what can be done

1237
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,220
um I mean you might have been following

1238
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,000
the most I guess headline grabbing a

1239
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,680
solution to what's been happening in

1240
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,079
Iran which is you know Elon Musk saying

1241
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,780
he's going to send starlink to Iran

1242
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,720
um this you know seems like you know a

1243
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,140
perfect solution I guess an ideal

1244
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,059
um but it is a little bit unclear how

1245
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,400
the security and safety of that would

1246
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,800
work um in terms of how you know Uplink

1247
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,780
connections for satellite internet would

1248
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,480
be detected and would lead to you know

1249
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,000
severe offline repression of anyone with

1250
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,220
starlink in Iran

1251
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,380
um what I do think the focus should be

1252
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,980
is on circumvention technology so how do

1253
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,680
we develop tools to address what Iran is

1254
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,700
doing

1255
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,619
um you know there's been Mallory was

1256
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:00,900
noting she was reading a report about

1257
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,660
how there's been you know

1258
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,380
um

1259
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,140
uh Imports of this kind of Technology

1260
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,119
from China to really Advance what

1261
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,619
they're doing to attacks or convention

1262
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:14,180
tools and so how um should we be helping

1263
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,400
Iranians kind of join this

1264
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,619
um battle against very sophisticated

1265
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,119
attacks

1266
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,940
um sophisticated anti-censorship attacks

1267
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,220
and so there's I think a lot of

1268
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,380
different things that can be done

1269
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,140
um one of the things that we have been

1270
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,319
looking at is the opportunities that

1271
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,740
have been been made available with a

1272
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,440
particular

1273
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,220
law in the United States which is

1274
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,380
Tech sanctions have been loosened at the

1275
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,059
start of this protest so the U.S

1276
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:51,599
treasury basically added cloud computing

1277
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,660
and Cloud platforms to technologies that

1278
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,359
can legally now be made available to

1279
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,819
Iran so things like gcp Google Cloud

1280
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:03,599
platforms are at the moment blocked in

1281
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,300
Iran from the Google side and of course

1282
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,200
things like gcp can easily you know join

1283
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,220
the roster of tools met for fighting

1284
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,119
internet censorship and I mean

1285
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,000
one of the things I've noted is that you

1286
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,880
know Google well the jigsaw made outline

1287
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,480
VPN for example it relies on other

1288
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,260
servers to be hosted or used in Iran and

1289
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,020
so this Google VPN itself cannot even

1290
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,500
rely on gcp infrastructure has to rely

1291
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,660
on digital ocean infrastructure which

1292
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,619
consequently also was legally

1293
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,079
um you know because of the change in

1294
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,819
regulation it could legally be available

1295
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,640
in Iran technically gcp can be now

1296
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,040
legally made available in Iran but

1297
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,760
Google has been slow to make this change

1298
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,500
um so that's one of the things

1299
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,900
we have been focused on

1300
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,300
um in terms of ensuring that things like

1301
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,059
Google and Amazon and Microsoft can you

1302
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:08,579
know adjust to these new regulations and

1303
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,619
help um in this fight

1304
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,599
um of course all of these Cloud

1305
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:15,079
providers could have facilitated

1306
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,460
circumvention Tech through domain

1307
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,020
fronting

1308
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,240
um some of you might know in 2018 domain

1309
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,480
fronting was closed down there's a wide

1310
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,220
array of reasons I guess for why this

1311
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,500
was closed down but at the time there

1312
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,680
was a push to work with these companies

1313
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,079
so that they would basically stop

1314
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,700
complying with the sanctions that

1315
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,460
blocked their services in Iran

1316
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,740
um and make domain fun uh domain

1317
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,440
fronting functional most famously signal

1318
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,099
use the Google app engine for its

1319
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,260
um circumvention strategy but of course

1320
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,599
that was disbanded when domain fronting

1321
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,619
was um disabled by all three companies

1322
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:56,880
um and so these are some of the

1323
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,520
recommendations that we have I'm sure a

1324
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,079
group full of Engineers and

1325
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:03,480
technologists would have more

1326
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,119
recommendations and I hope all your

1327
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:09,359
expertise can help join this uh battle

1328
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,420
for internet freedom in Iran thank you

1329
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,680
thank you Masa

00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:21,119
so we do have a bit of time if folks

1331
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,680
want to get in the queue and share all

1332
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,359
of your ideas

1333
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:27,180
um for how to do for convention better

1334
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,680
um or other comments or questions you

1335
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,919
might have

1336
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,700
uh Phil Han Baker I'd like to listen

1337
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,839
um I want to know all your requirements

1338
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,940
in depth

1339
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,180
um as much information as possible

1340
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,300
I think in terms of the standards

1341
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,619
process

1342
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:53,220
we have to think in terms of two buckets

1343
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,400
in that anything we do is going to be

1344
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,119
subject to counter circumvention

1345
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,920
and you know there was the old thing of

1346
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,520
one war one rifle

1347
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,800
and so as soon as we had tour and the

1348
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,920
original uh democracy protests after the

1349
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,380
stolen election Iran you know they

1350
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,880
basically worked out how to get through

1351
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,020
tour

1352
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,880
and then we saw the attacks on did you

1353
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,119
notar and my company at the time Komodo

1354
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,480
uh that came out of that

1355
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,160
um I think that we need to think of two

1356
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,480
separate tracks

1357
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,000
one developing cryptographic security

1358
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,920
Technologies

1359
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,339
and the second of which is

1360
00:57:34,339 --> 00:57:36,839
steganographic Technologies

1361
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:38,819
in that we've got you're not going to be

1362
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,319
able to standardize the

1363
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,660
anti-circumvention technology that's

1364
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,740
going to have to be something that's

1365
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,800
agile and keeps changing and responding

1366
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,380
to the adversary

1367
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,839
however the cryptographic technology

1368
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,660
there we can provide you with some

1369
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,180
building blocks that should help go

1370
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,140
through

1371
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,099
the uh then the stagnography can operate

1372
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,020
on

1373
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,819
um and you know Quicks won't start on

1374
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,740
that uh I've got a

1375
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,960
slightly more hard-boiled

1376
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,240
um traffic analysis uh resistant

1377
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,760
approach

1378
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,520
um we can maybe go further but that

1379
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,200
might be how we can kind of like do a

1380
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,040
standards component that is reusable

1381
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,540
but there's always going to have to be

1382
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,819
some tactical development on the

1383
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:29,839
stagnographic front

1384
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:38,480
yep cheers go ahead

1385
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,220
uh I I just I think uh just mentioned

1386
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,079
just tour wasn't explicitly mentioned in

1387
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,540
these slides here but uh it seems

1388
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,339
traditionally being a place where tour

1389
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,440
is used and it's still used like right

1390
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,780
now I mean if you look in the on the

1391
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,339
Tour website there are there is this

1392
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:58,020
sort of a fair number of users who are

1393
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,819
still using there are certain

1394
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:01,980
kind of connection technique transports

1395
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,619
uh that have been blocked but not all of

1396
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,319
them have like Snowflake and uh OBS V4

1397
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:10,260
and all that are possible but as as you

1398
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,720
say it's like a continual battle so

1399
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,160
anyway yeah

1400
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,940
um last accurate so the first of those

1401
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,619
were two great talks thank you for

1402
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:23,880
inviting them and thank you for coming

1403
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,920
and talking to us

1404
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,940
um

1405
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,619
so Philip said some interesting things

1406
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:30,119
and I think so if there is a role for

1407
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:32,220
the iitf here but it's already irtf here

1408
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,540
but it's not necessarily like

1409
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,540
standardizing anything right but

1410
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,579
um there are people that that are sort

1411
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,859
of looking at machine generating

1412
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:42,660
circumvention techniques I think we

1413
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,220
might have even given them the applied

1414
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,599
networking research price a while ago

1415
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,420
right so those things were basically try

1416
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,839
to learn about weaknesses in this in in

1417
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,720
the inspection and blocking Technologies

1418
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,839
by creatively using our protocols and

1419
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,119
and you know basically playing with the

1420
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,480
headers playing with a packet traces

1421
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,760
um to to confuse those boxes right and

1422
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,559
it's an arms race so so the standard

1423
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:09,900
doesn't make sense but a forum for

1424
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,819
discussing this like bringing people

1425
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:14,460
together to build these and evasion

1426
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,540
techniques

1427
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,040
with the people that understand the

1428
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,900
protocols very deeply might be an

1429
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,640
interesting experiment to me

1430
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:24,660
another which is great because I got in

1431
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,099
the queue to talk a little bit about

1432
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:27,839
what

1433
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,480
um I've seen also to point people to a

1434
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,760
draft that is

1435
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,520
um in the Privacy research group on

1436
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,599
censorship techniques so that was also

1437
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,520
noted over the course of its development

1438
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,680
maybe seven years that it changes all

1439
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,540
the time

1440
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,280
um but it's useful to write it down it's

1441
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,000
useful to talk about it I think that we

1442
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,180
do have examples of work the ietf does

1443
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,599
on maybe standardizing Frameworks within

1444
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,180
which people work I don't know a lot

1445
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,040
about Yang but I get the idea that

1446
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,680
that's kind of what it's about and I

1447
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,240
would say that the work that the

1448
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,000
community has done so so

1449
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,799
um sort of the Civil Society Community

1450
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,200
the folks that are really trying to keep

1451
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,700
the internet on for everybody all over

1452
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,160
the world they're definitely two strong

1453
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,559
camps there are those that measure the

1454
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:21,660
censorship like uni and Simona and

1455
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,400
others and then there are the folks that

1456
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,440
are building tools or

1457
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,500
um tool Bridges or things like that to

1458
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,359
actually respond to exactly the thing

1459
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:32,760
that you've all identified which is that

1460
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,059
it's a moving Target and what some of

1461
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,559
those things are called it's a general

1462
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,119
bucket it doesn't necessarily mean any

1463
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,359
one specific tools plugable transports

1464
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,220
where you have things like you know tour

1465
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,200
Maybe doesn't work but something like

1466
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,780
snowflake is sitting on top of tour to

1467
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,640
help people get on it better and then

1468
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,020
once you're on the network then it's

1469
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,359
harder to be

1470
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:57,059
um it's harder for your traffic to to be

1471
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:59,339
seen and things like that so that work

1472
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:02,099
happens I think it would be great

1473
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:04,619
actually to have it happen in the ietf

1474
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:07,260
OR to figure out how to bring that

1475
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,119
Community here more often so that they

1476
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,000
can get the critical feedback from you

1477
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,640
all who are simultaneously developing

1478
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,119
whole protocols like quick but then also

1479
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:20,400
might be swept up in this problem where

1480
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,079
just the protocol itself is getting

1481
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,720
blocked something I think is fairly a

1482
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,500
new trend in censorship is to just block

1483
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,359
Things based on protocol that's new we

1484
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:32,880
don't want that to happen so how can we

1485
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,339
um how can we also mitigate that issue

1486
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,619
so yeah anyway thanks so much masa for

1487
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:38,460
coming

1488
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,559
um thanks everyone for your feedback and

1489
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,839
attendance and I think we're closing out

1490
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:47,420
the IAB meeting for this session thanks

1491
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:59,780
as well thank you for all your work

1492
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,680
I like

1493
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,720
