00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
agenda today

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,379
um and so we do have a little bit of

36
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,300
time for an open mic at the end

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,180

um

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,140
there is a notes page linked from the

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,020
agenda I will note that there's also a

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,180
chat room link from the agenda but we

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,640
have a tiny issue where the it's not

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,900
linked actually to the working group

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,080
chairs uh zulip it's linked to the emo

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,940
der Zulu so uh for today's meeting uh if

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,319
you're going to use the chat room online

48
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,140
it's going to be linked to emoder and

49
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,220
we'll get that fixed in the future

50
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,959
that's one of the things that we're kind

51
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,180
of aware of uh so with that I'd like to

52
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,580
go ahead and get started uh the first

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,500
item

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,080
uh I guess there I should allow a tiny

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,019
agenda bash agenda bashing anybody nope

56
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,599
nope okay excellent

57
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,319
um

58
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
so with the first we are going to

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
introduce our New Roc series Consulting

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,319
editor Alexis did you want to come

61
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,239
forward and

62
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,420
foreign

63
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,019
people I met at the social last night

64
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,940
um so I'm I'm new I've only been here

65
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,980
for about two months so my comprehension

66
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,420
level of everything you guys do at this

67
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,480
meeting about 30 percent I'd say so I'm

68
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,580
hoping uh at the next one it'll be at

69
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,159
least 80 percent so um if you have

70
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
anything that you would like to bring up

71
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,700
me the current things I'm working on are

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,200
a revamp of the RFC editor.org website

73
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,340
kind of getting all of our archiving

74
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,099
agreements up to date where we take full

75
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,260
sets of the rfcs and make sure they're

76
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,319
housed somewhere else for safe keeping

77
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,720
and also I just started working on

78
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,339
making sure that all of the outlinks

79
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,560
from rfcs get preserved the idea behind

80
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,600
that being

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,220
you put all this time into writing

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,380
something you want people to be able to

83
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,540
actually understand what your references

84
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,120
meant uh 10 or 20 years from now those

85
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
links will probably die so we're going

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,080
to get those archived and make sure that

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,500
those remain legible over time if you

88
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,240
have other things that you think I

89
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,479
should be looking at in the future or if

90
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,800
you just want to talk to me about any of

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,840
those things please come find me okay

um

94
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,040
so I guess there weren't any specific

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,540
questions for Alexis if there are you

96
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,000

role of legal support for the ITF for

115

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,520
foundation and we do still stay in touch

118
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,160

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,780
uh we have 15 minutes today

121
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,039
um which I don't know that we really

122
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,139
will need um I thought maybe we would

123
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,759
just spend a minute kind of giving a

124
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,080
little bit of background about ourselves

125
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
and and

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,560
um uh just really as an introduction so

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,840
you have names and faces and a general

128
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,300
sense of of who we are

129
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,400
um in terms of substantive things we

130
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,280
could potentially talk about the um uh

131
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Anti-Trust issue is one that's been up

132
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,860
lately we have a uh internet draft

133
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,139
that's in front of the Gen dispatch

134
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,600
group right now and one of the points of

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,919
feedback we've gotten about that has

136
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,220
related to working group chairs um so

137
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,660
maybe I'll Circle back to that and just

138
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,580
see if there's any uh you know give you

139
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,960
a little more sense of what we're doing

140
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
there and talk a little bit about the

141
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
potential for antitrust training if that

142
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,360
would be of interest to the working

143
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,740
group chairs

144
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,319
but um why don't we start just initially

145
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,660
with a little bit about uh us and our

146
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,940
our firm and so we're part of a small

147
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,880
law firm called bit of Law PC

148
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,819
um as I mentioned we took over the role

149
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,539
of supporting ITF back in 2018

150
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,919
generally what we do is for a boutique

151
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
law firm with three lawyers and we

152
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,340
supported several different standards

153
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,500
organizations in addition to in addition

154
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,240
to the ITF and that's really all we do

155
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
is support standards organizations

156
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,380
um the uh I my personal background is I

157
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,560
was a previously played a role at Intel

158
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,539
Corporation Called sigs and standards

159
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,280
led a group called sigs and standards

160
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,979
practice group and so uh intel was an

161
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,720
interesting place to learn standards

162
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,940
because it's um a company that's

163
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,440
involved in many many different

164
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,000
standards and open source organizations

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,960
and um prior to that I worked for a big

166
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,240
a big law firm in the Silicon Valley Law

167
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,639
Firm godward and also for a short

168
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,340
period was a general counsel of internet

169
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,099
music startup back in the heady days of

170
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,759
the first.com boom called mp3.com

171
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,319
so let me uh let me ask my colleague

172
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,759
bigness if she could do a quick intro

173
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,440
and then maybe we can Circle back to the

174
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,240
antitrust and any other topics you want

175
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,780
to hear about

176
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,360
so hi everyone my name is Victor bronder

177
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,180
and I work with Brad my background was

178
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,520
also at a large Law Firm where I started

179
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,800
out in Tech transactions and went

180
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,099
in-house in a tech uh

181
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,280
Council role and then moved out west in

182
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,500
search of a better life and found Brad

183
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
and uh he introduced me to the world of

184
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,940
standards and I've been dedicating my

185
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,640
practice to that since then so great to

186
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,059
meet you all

187
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,458
so yeah so let's maybe just spend a

188
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,958
minute I can give you some background on

189
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,880
this issue of antitrust because I do

190
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,320
think that is maybe the one current

191
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,480
topic that's uh that has some relevance

192
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,580
for for all of you

193
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,800
um the uh generally when we talk about

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
interest law we're talking also it's

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,100
like the terminology can also be

196
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,740
competition law and so that's the the

197
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,880
general issue in connection with

198
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,200
standards is anytime you know a set of

199
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,459
competitors potential competitors are

200
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,019
getting together and talking with each

201
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,080
other that can be really beneficial and

202
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,300
ultimately result in in consumer benefit

203
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,060
but there's always the kind of risk of

204
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,279
some kind of uh collusion among

205
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,440
commercial entities that that have some

206
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Market power and so it's it's a kind of

207
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,300
perennial uh issue for standards

208
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,040
organizations is how do you manage the

209
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,779
risk of antitrust uh you know law

210
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,420
problems or competition law problems

211
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,120
um the ITF is actually very cleverly

212
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
designed and I think very intentionally

213
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,100
designed in a way that uh that mitigates

214
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,959
antitrust risks and there's a whole

215
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,240
bunch of reasons why this is true we

216
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,779
have a blog post uh the the the uh ITF

217
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,180
LLC a while back did a blog post that

218
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,360
kind of walked through this analysis and

219
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,680
um it's something that's captured to

220
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,260
some degree in the uh in the ID that's

221
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,959
currently in front of gen dispatch so so

222
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,820
generally our our key message around

223
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,720
antitrust in connection with the iitf is

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,279
follow our policies you know our our

225
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,160
existing policies if they're implemented

226
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,100
you know correctly are are really

227
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,380
specifically designed to to mitigate

228
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,540
antitrust risks

229
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,300
we we do have this ID that's currently

230
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,700
uh as I mentioned in front of the of gen

231
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,000
dispatch and and it's not intended to be

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,300
a new policy it's really intended to say

233
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,760
Hey you know uh stakeholders who are

234
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,500
worried about Anti-Trust risks in

235
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,540
connection with iitf please understand

236
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,820
this is our approach our approach is you

237
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,620
know we do have these various elements

238
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,440
of how we're organized how the iotf is

239
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,019
designed that do mitigate these risks

240
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,600
and so the really key message is follow

241
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,640
these policies

242
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,240
um

243
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
it also makes the point that there are

244
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,160
some areas some topics that are kind of

245
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,320
potentially fraught with antitrust risk

246
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,260
that they're not off limits uh but but

247
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,779
potentially uh you know can can be a

248
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,160
little dicey and the specific issues

249
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,740
that are flagged are one when we're

250
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,540
trying to

251
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,000
compare the relative cost of different

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,640
implementations you know that's a that

253
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,339
that analysis can be can get tricky

254
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,240
sorry not yeah the microphone sorry

255
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,560
um the comparing the relative cost of uh

256
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,260
technical implementations can be a

257
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,300
tricky analysis to do because it starts

258
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,880
to get into issues like specific prices

259
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,740
and things like that which can be

260
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,940
problematic from an antitrust

261
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,920
perspective so relative costs issues

262
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,700
um are are is one one area of concern

263
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,140
another area of concern potentially is

264
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,040
around something that's perceived as

265
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,860
negotiating IPR terms and so this can be

266
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,079
a tricky one in the ITF context because

267
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,660
we do you know specifically go and ask

268
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,820
it's a requirement that people disclose

269
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,220
something about their relevant IPR where

270
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,720
it can get a little bit tricky is if we

271
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,579
get a

272
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,660
ambiguous or or potentially problematic

273
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,339
disclosure and there's some desire to go

274
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,399
and talk with that that discloser the

275
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,959
party that disclosed about their

276
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,480
disclosure that's that's a legitimate

277
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,920
thing to do

278
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,839
um the the area that gets a bit fraud is

279
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,760
if it starts to look like there's some

280
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,700
kind of collective negotiation with that

281
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,579
party about their IP terms so so that's

282
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,459
a point that's made in in the document

283
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,579
um that uh what we say there is hey

284
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,459
these aren't off limits but do talk to

285
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:37,740
ietf experts um about this before you

286
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,600
start doing these kinds of things I

287
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,399
think some of the input we got from the

288
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,440
working group chairs was well hey whoa

289
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,300
are we the people that are going to be

290
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,060
receiving these questions and if so like

291
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,579
we have concerns about that uh we we

292
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,920
hear you on that point and uh and I

293
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,600
think you know our message is you know

294
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,540
you we are here as resources for you so

295
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,339
if if at any point

296
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,339
there's any elements of uh you know

297
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,380
antitrust law or really any other issue

298
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,100
where you receive questions that feel

299
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,600
uncomfortable for any reason you can

300
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,700
escalate to us it's probably best to

301
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,040
escalate to us through Jay or through

302
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,839
the the legal at Intel legal at

303
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,360
idf.org mailing list but uh but we

304
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,220
really are here as a as a resource for

305
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,300
you

306
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,639
our intent is to come back to you at

307
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,639
some point in the future and do a round

308
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,620
of a little bit more formal training on

309
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,620
antitrust issues so um I hope this would

310
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,200
be of interest to you it's um not

311
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,940
required or anything like that it's uh

312
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,440
it's really designed to be something

313
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,720
that's educational

314
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,060
um and so we really you know we'll we'll

315
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,100
be interested to come back and and uh

316
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,420
and do that

317
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,219
I see uh Sean has a question

318
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,959
check

319
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,639
all right I'll eat it

320
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,200
um hey so Brad I guess the question

321
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,899
about the IPR thing you can I think the

322
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,639
tool actually allows you to submit an

323
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,120
IPR disclosure even third party with no

324
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,660
statement so you can go and ask so

325
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,160
should that be tweaked where they

326
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,600
actually have to put something to kind

327
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,660
of stop this nebulous like kind of not

328
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,000
clear clean

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
I I think my my instinct right now is

330
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,500
like nothing's really broken you know

331
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,680
the the uh that like we we have I mean

332
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,720
these issues are complex and there's

333
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,700
lots of moving parts and and what we

334
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,360
have just like works you know 99 of the

335
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,760
time so I'm I'm less inclined to go and

336
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,399
make changes for these sort of one-off

337
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,920
you know potential edge cases

338
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,899
um so I guess my answer is I don't

339
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,399
really have an equation to to change

340
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,959
anything right now it's more of just an

341
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,120
educational thing if you get that weird

342
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,980
situation where you feel compelled to go

343
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,320
and ask questions it's worth looping in

344
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,540
either just people who are experienced

345
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,639
in how we've done that in the past or

346
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,860
looping us but to get get some help for

347
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,480
those okay great thanks for the

348
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,839
clarification

349
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,820
Michael Richardson does it work oh you

350
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,560
have to really eat it you said

351
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,660
um so are there any um legal or

352
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,660
financial consequences to entities that

353
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,320
um

354
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,019
make useless pointless IPR claims

355
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,579
especially that are so vague that no one

356
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,740
can do anything with them

357
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,740
so so when somebody makes a claim like

358
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,260
you're saying when within the pattern

359
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,019
that I have not yet really disclosed uh

360
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,620
um you know uh is in affects the Fubar

361
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,300
working group and don't even tell us

362
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,500
what document or what section

363
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,959
yeah

364
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,940
and and it happens like seemingly on a

365
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,060
regular basis right from people I think

366
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,680
ought to know better but

367
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,240
there doesn't seem to be any consequence

368
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,339
to doing that

369
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,699
yeah it's probably like the exact facts

370
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,740
would matter in any particular case

371
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,279
um

372
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,740
I would say maybe would probably be

373
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,440
helpful to us is to really articulate

374
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,060
the problem statement you know like is

375
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,279
it is this Behavior causing a very

376
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,260
specific problem for you well yeah it's

377
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,120
causing causing a hundred people in the

378
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,740
working group to waste two hours of

379
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,300
their time figuring out what's going on

380
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,480
so I mean we have to decide if if we

381
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,820
care or not and we're not supposed to

382
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,980
really do this collectively so we

383
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,839
actually individually have to somehow

384
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,120
decide this is

385
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,860
um and then there's no consequence they

386
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,100
can just do it again yeah right

387
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,220
so yeah interesting feedback and useful

388
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,480
like I think that's the kind of thing

389
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,220
that would that I think we would say oh

390
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,199
is my theory that nothing really is

391
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,820
broken correct and if there is something

392
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,220
broken let's identify that and think

393
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,019
about a solution so I'm happy to have

394
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,240
more discussion about that

395
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,639
um

396
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,500
so uh so working group chair when should

397
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,759
I

398
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,740
um what should trigger me to come talk

399
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,079
to is there anything that any kind of

400
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,579
concrete advice that you can give me

401
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,099
like if you hear these sort of things

402
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,919
then you know that's when you give us a

403
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,059
ring yeah there's so in the current ID

404
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,339
and in the training that we will

405
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,160
eventually deliver to you we uh do have

406
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,540
some you know there's some things that

407
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,579
are kind of obvious red flags like if

408
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,140
you're if someone's talking about like

409
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,900
the price of specific products and you

410
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,640
know kind of like classic antitrust

411
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,919
problems like let's divide this Market

412
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,780
or or things like that so there's some

413
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,400
things that would just be like big red

414
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,140
flags I think those kinds of discussions

415
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,660
right were really happen here the the

416
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,580
trickier ones are probably the two that

417
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,020
I mentioned you know we're trying to do

418
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,240
some kind of comparative cost analysis

419
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,820
or we're trying to have a kind of a

420
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,520
nuanced uh IPR discussion so those would

421
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,740
be the general topics some but I do

422
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,960
think there's a lot of experience within

423
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,120
the ITF um about how to handle those

424
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,980
topics so it's not necessarily that like

425
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,260
we are the only resources for you but I

426
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,700
do think that those are the topics that

427
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,320
probably warrant self-care all right I

428
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,500
think

429
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,500
uh this is a point of order question are

430
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,860
we using the the uh online queue for

431
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,820
queuing

432
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,620
yes yes thank you

433
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,620
thank you

434
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,559
hi uh Juan Carlos uh

435
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,900
I I sure I would like to respond a

436
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,360
little bit to Michael's Point

437
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,240
um I know that uh most of us have very

438
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,660
little uh understanding of legal uh

439
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,780
language and it's hard for engineers to

440
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,500
understand and act upon legal text so

441
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,480
it's indeed something that is confusing

442
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,760
and hard to to follow whenever there's a

443
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,080
declaration that it's hard to understand

444
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,360
especially if we don't understand the

445
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,580
the claims what is what is exactly the

446
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,100
the uh the licensing terms that are

447
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,080
being disclosed what how will that

448
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,419
affect my business model respect to the

449
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,880
product Etc so all these little details

450
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
should be taken into account whenever we

451
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,919
act upon that and of course most people

452
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,220
here do not understand those details so

453
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,580
uh perhaps uh we should trying to to

454
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,400
make sure that the process flows educate

455
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,400
people on simple things like licensing

456
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,960
terms for instance whenever there's a

457
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,820
declaration what type of license is

458
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,640
being uh uh declared right is it a

459
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,100
friend is it a royalty-free uh uh how

460
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,620
would this affect the future of the

461
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,720
product that will implement this

462
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,799
specification those little rules could

463
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,140
help us understand and make sure that

464
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,480
the group understands how they should

465
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,720
act upon that uh declaration because

466
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,120
indeed I've seen multiple times that

467
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,460
people take a declaration there's a

468
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,700
patent oh yes no no I mean there's a lot

469
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,039
of things that we have to understand

470
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,020
Beyond whether the pattern applies to

471
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,059
that part of the specification if it's

472
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,299
an optional mandatory or not so so we

473
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,280
can go deeper and deeper but and we are

474
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,500
not going to have a legal discussion in

475
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,700
the working group because we are

476
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,980
technical people right but at least

477
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,440
maybe just to make things clearer to

478
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,059
people we should understand the type of

479
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,100
licenses the consequences

480
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,100
the implications and from there we say

481
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,200
okay if you need more information go

482
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,600
talk to your legal team because this

483
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,240
will potentially affect your company

484
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,820
your business model your interests and

485
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,460
not the working groups in general

486
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,020
got it okay yeah that's quite helpful

487
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,240
input so what I'm hearing is you know we

488
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,740
had some interest in coming back and

489
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,539
presenting training on antitrust issues

490
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,860
it sounds like there'd also potentially

491
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,200
be some interest in a practical issue

492
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,179
that you all have is you get an IPR

493
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,160
declaration it's confusing you're not

494
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,900
sure how to react to it and so giving

495
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,580
some suggestions for you about how to

496
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,140
interpret and potentially how to react

497
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,539
to IPR declarations could be something

498
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,280
that's useful so I've heard message

499
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,620
heard on that

500
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,520
hi uh Jim Fenton um

501
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,660
apologies if this is a little bit out of

502
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,860
order but

503
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,320
um to what extent are you advising us on

504
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,320
uh things like export controls and

505
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
sanctioned countries and things of that

506
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,679
sort or are we kind of on our own

507
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,740
because that's a country-specific issue

508
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,840
uh it's that's definitely a topic that's

509
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,240
within our preview and we provide advice

510
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,299
to you know the the LLC which is really

511
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,740
the legal entity that's that's

512
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,500
responsible for managing compliance with

513
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,960
uh you know with with all sorts of you

514
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,460
know with law and regulation around the

515
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,200
globe so that's yeah it's definitely in

516
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
our purview and if if there's like a

517
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,580
specific issue that uh that that you

518
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,440
need input on you know we'd be available

519
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,480
for that generally it's something that

520
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,100
we're we do feel like is being well

521
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,659
managed in a kind of top-down way

522
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,100
through the through the LLC

523
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,940
um can I just remind people when you

524
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,860
finished eating place to put masks on

all right well if there's no other

528
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,679
questions unless do you have any last

529
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:11,960
words I guess

530
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,059
the uh yeah we appreciate the discussion

531
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,880
um and uh yeah we're again real uh

532
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,320
really do appreciate the opportunity to

533
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
be here and um just we have I believe we

534
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,059
have a remote person in the queue so

535
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,919
just hold one sec sure James are you

536
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,640
there

537
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,860
thank you Karen uh sorry for the last

538
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,179
minute

539
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,520
um uh just to Echo the previous things

540
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,780
about IPR decorations being important uh

541
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,260
one thing to consider as well as

542
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,840
uh document Shepherds we have a step in

543
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,120
the process where we have to show that

544
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,780
we've uh sufficiently pestered people to

545
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,700
make their appropriate IPR declarations

546
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,780
and it's not clear how best to do that

547
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,039
um if you're you're going to be

548
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,280
providing guidance on to chairs thus

549
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,500
document Shepherds on IPR things it

550
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,880
would be good to consider that as well

551
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,860
got it yep understood that there that

552
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,299
one component if we're going to come

553
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,400
back with some suggestions on how to

554
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,980
manage IPR declarations a component of

555
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,700
that would be that that piece of you you

556
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,280
know going and asking about IPR and uh

557
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,780
and giving some guidance on that so

558
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,260
thank you

559
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,220
all right

560
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,820
so uh thank you both very much and uh as

561
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,840
you've heard they've offered to do

562
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,240
training so any things that any further

563
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,039
things that you think you might want

564
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
some additional training on uh you could

565
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,720
post that to the working group chairs

566
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,700
mailing list and we'll make sure that

567
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,440
they get a chance to see that

568
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,799
um

569
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,179
so next up is Ignacio

570
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,860
hello everybody can you hear me

571
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,439
um

572
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,039
okay uh well hello everybody uh I'm

573
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,360
gonna be telling you a little bit about

574
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,840
what I see that is going on the idea

575
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,400
file through some work that I've been

576
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,480
doing with colleagues from the

577
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,340
University of Glasgow some of which you

578
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,679
might know and most of the findings that

579
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,780
I'm presenting here are in some papers

580
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,400
that we have already published we

581
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
combine a little bit of social network

582
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,460
analysis and natural language processing

583
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,039
to analyze uh emails drops and

584
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,600
everything that is going on there uh

585
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,379
next slide please

586
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,740
on the basic key takeaways that we have

587
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,080
seen through this couple of years of

588
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,780
researching on the ITF data is that

589
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,179
conversation seems to be more complex uh

590
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:55,860
it seems to be harder to publish and it

591
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,020
seems that there is a minor influence

592
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,460
and minority that is becoming

593
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,640
increasingly relevant next slide please

594
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,140
thank you

595
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,600
and this seems to be interrelated next

596
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,400
please

597
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,580
uh so let me Focus quickly first on uh

598
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,980
whether it's harder to publish uh next

599
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,380
please

600
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,880
it's quite a few grabs so maybe don't

601
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,740
worry too much about reading into the

602
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,900
access but basically the key takeaways

603
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,340
that in the last 20 years uh it now we

604
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,440
triple the amount of time it takes for

605
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,600
under FC to be published from the time

606
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,460
the first uh draft appears uh next slide

607
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,760
uh it also takes a more than double the

608
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,159
number of drops uh for Nerf C to be

609
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,159
published uh next slide

610
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,200
and there are a few other findings like

611
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,760
there are more affiliations more areas

612
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
more offers for every single draft

613
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,279
pretty consistently uh and this seems to

614
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,020
point in the direction that it's harder

615
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,700
to publish of course this is all with

616
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,380
kavits because the numbers are numbers

617
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,559
but interpretation might be subtle uh

618
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,600
conversations also seem to be more

619
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,220
complex in Texas like this

620
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,940
next

621
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,460
uh

622
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,220
the idea is becoming quite chatty uh

623
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,840
there is a decreasing number of female

624
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,820
participants this is people who have

625
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,240
sent at least one email in one year uh

626
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,520
so if for one year you don't send

627
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,140
anything you would appear as not a

628
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,539
participant and in the next one you just

629
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,480
an email you could appear there uh and

630
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,919
Nexus live please

631
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,020
if you look at the red line that's the

632
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,640
number of emails and as you can see

633
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,500
there is an increase in Divergence which

634
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,120
is what I refer to as the idea of

635
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,120
becoming chatty basically less people on

636
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,919
similar amount of emails so pretty much

637
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,500
more emails per person uh next slide

638
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,000
please

639
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,220
and just for context I've also been

640
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,500
looking at the the Web Consortium and

641
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,659
the similar Dynamics happened there so

642
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,940
it's not unique to the idea of Nexus

643
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,559
live

644
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,720
uh there is also an increasing number of

645
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,720
mentions or two drops in the emails uh

646
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,640
this is normalized by the number of

647
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,640
active uh drafts at a given in a given

648
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,720
year

649
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,419
to me these points to increasing cross

650
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,220
references increasing number of things

651
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,559
that need to be taken into account and

652
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,360
that's what I refer to as conversations

653
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,640
becoming more complex so you need to be

654
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,140
on top of more emails you need to be on

655
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,380
top of more drops on Nexus slide please

656
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,600
and it

657
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,179
there is it seems to be that at the same

658
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,880
time uh there's an influential minority

659
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,700
that is gaining relevance and I have

660
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,220
more results on the papers pointing for

661
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,159
example to uh more uh Arias more topics

662
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,980
being discussed in the conversations uh

663
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,120
so next slide please

664
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,880
next

665
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,200
so

666
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,240
to get a better understanding on what's

667
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,400
going on in the inside of the mail is we

668
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,460
we graph we do a graph of the people in

669
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,200
the middle so basically each one of you

670
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,179
could be a note and if you reply to a

671
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,980
message of someone else that would be a

672
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,100
link and then we calculate between a

673
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,840
symmetric of influence which is

674
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
typically done social network analysis

675
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,580
and what you consider is uh people

676
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,100
plotted by the level of influence that

677
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,340
they have from more to less so on the

678
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,779
extreme left you have the more

679
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,700
influential people on the right less

680
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,320
influential people according to that

681
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,020
metric and what you can see is that on

682
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,720
one hand uh people are discussing more

683
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,059
areas over the years and these are

684
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,400
itfres

685
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,480
and on the other hand

686
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,480
this is mostly done by people who is

687
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,120
more influential so over the years more

688
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,799
areas are being discussed and influencer

689
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,500
people are particularly prominent in

690
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,900
discussing more areas and next slide

691
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,080
please

692
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,020
um and this influencing minority is also

693
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,980
dominating uh draft creation so more an

694
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,900
increasing number of drafts are offered

695
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,360
by these people of probably some of you

696
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,020
uh that are particularly critical in

697
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,120
terms of centrality on the graph of the

698
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,500
mail list next slide please

699
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,539
uh apparently it looks like it takes a

700
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,520
longer amount of time to uh gain

701
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,960
influence uh please

702
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,960
and to focus a little bit on you guys

703
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,200
this is a uh about working group chairs

704
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,059
so this is looking one year before

705
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,159
someone becomes a working group chair

706
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,020
and when you are looking after the

707
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,179
person becomes working group chair and

708
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,880
this is in the period 2000 2020 which

709
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,500
most of the analysis is because data

710
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,539
tracker is more reliable for that period

711
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,539
and um we also built a graph for

712
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,299
authorship pretty much similar to the

713
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,880
one of uh the males and we calculate

714
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,740
again between a symmetric of influence

715
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,779
so basically if you are in The

716
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,580
Crossroads of many drops you will have

717
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,039
high between us asymmetric of influence

718
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,380
next slide please

719
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,559
and there are I could say two key

720
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,440
takeaways here one is that the most of

721
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,000
the working chairs are pretty

722
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,220
influential both in the draft authorship

723
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,059
graph and on uh on the main list uh next

724
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:16,620
one

725
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,100
and there is a clear shift the 1gr uh

726
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,720
well two years because this is one year

727
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,279
before you become a working group chip

728
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,260
around one year after there is a clear

729
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,140
shift on how influential you are in both

730
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,580
of these graphs

731
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,520
uh next is like this

732
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,700
and this is very high level I'm very

733
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,039
quickly uh the research that you can

734
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,679
find those papers and my impression is

735
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,100
that I it is harder to publish and the

736
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,720
conversations are more complex and this

737
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,419
is pretty much interrelated the space is

738
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,460
smaller many things are becoming a

739
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,140
community many things are not novel

740
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,299
developments but uh frequently patching

741
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,860
so there is increasing dependence

742
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,140
between drops between Technologies and

743
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,120
as a result of this conversations are

744
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,679
quite complicated you need to be on top

745
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,240
of many things you need to be on top of

746
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,419
multiple areas and as a result of this I

747
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,940
hypothesize that some of these people

748
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,799
that appear to be influential are

749
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,659
somehow a little bit of our share pass

750
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,940
or shepherding other people that might

751
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,419
have a less knowledge of multiple areas

752
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:21,299
Dynamics on the idea for and are maybe

753
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,460
helping them to go through the

754
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,919
standardization process some of our

755
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,140
preliminary results suggest that this

756
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,399
could be the case we are looking at a

757
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,020
psycholinguistic traits in the language

758
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,840
used by people on those with higher

759
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,419
influence seem to be using uh categories

760
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,919
of language that are more associated

761
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,220
with the collaboration and supportive

762
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,140
roles on next slide

763
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,440
next steps we are looking into uh

764
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,360
getting some ground truth on several

765
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,940
things so uh at the moment we are

766
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,460
annotating conversations or agreement

767
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,159
disagreement and that type of stuff to

768
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,140
get a better understanding of what are

769
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,480
the internal Dynamics at the scale in

770
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,020
the conversations within the ITF uh this

771
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,760
is about drops in general as you

772
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,100
probably know uh nerfc there are many

773
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,200
rfcs but not all the rfcs are equal some

774
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,700
are deployed some are not deployed some

775
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,559
are relevant some are pretty much

776
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,240
irrelevant and it's very difficult to

777
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,919
have a good metric on this so we're

778
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,419
planning to do a survey asking people

779
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,940
like yourself to please help us a bit

780
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,279
and attack which ones from your own

781
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
perspective are deployed or not deployed

782
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
uh we are also working in doing a review

783
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,440
recommending engine and that's the QR

784
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,679
code that you consider uh where we are

785
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,600
looking at the conversations that every

786
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,820
single participant has had uh the

787
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,860
content of the emails doing some

788
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,679
vectorization of the language use and

789
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,240
looking for similarity to try to

790
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,700
identify good matches between idea of

791
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,340
participants and drafts uh to make

792
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,960
suggestions of who could be a good

793
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,059
reviewer and we are asking for a little

794
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,120
bit of help to uh out of those that we

795
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,740
identify as a potentially good

796
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,559
candidates for people who have expertise

797
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,659
on the area to tag them as a good

798
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,179
candidate but candidates so we can do a

799
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,279
more refined guess starting from this

800
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,460
point

801
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,360
and these are details of how we are

802
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,799
doing it but I think that I have already

803
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,539
talking off on a product that's enough

804
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:28,460
for them very hard to take any questions

805
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,220
activities

806
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,840
good job

807
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,100
so I have several uh questions about

808
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,539
your

809
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,840
methodology okay

810
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,000
um and then you made some conclusions

811
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,380
about

812
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,419
publishing time and I have questions

813
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,300
about all the methodology let me hit two

814
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,820
or three high points and suggest

815
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,339
I'd be glad to talk to you offline

816
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:18,719
there is an original study in the 18 in

817
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,699
um

818
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,739
that came about 90 1990s 1995s by Simcoe

819
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,379
how do you reference the work that was

820
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,899
done there or have you looked into the

821
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,260
work that he used for classification

822
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,399
sorry can you say Simcoe

823
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:41,219
s-i-m-c-o-e lawyer uh did a study in

824
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:44,699
this working group reference uh he

825
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,899
looked at the speed of drafts through

826
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:51,719
the itft looked at conflict which you

827
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,460
haven't mentioned inside of the working

828
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,639
group he looked at complexity he then

829
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,000
demonstrate he demonstrated a reference

830
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,200
between complexity of informational

831
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,780
standards

832
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,980
non-informational standards things which

833
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,440
you can track directly on the data

834
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,200
attacker he also looked at the type of

835
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,859
participants creating it and so

836
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,440
I'm just asking whether you've looked at

837
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,619
this past uh statistical work which was

838
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,079
done on the same type of data that

839
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,180
you're working on which is mail list

840
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,660
with different assumptions and I'm also

841
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,460
would like to know your

842
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,980
uh background scholarly you know

843
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,940
reference in group dynamics so again I'm

844
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,099
just pointing out there was a past study

845
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,500
and asking first what past studies do

846
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,339
you reference and then how do you

847
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:49,920
differentiate uh right so I I need to

848
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,660
check with Franco there are quite a few

849
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,220
reference and I'm not really sure I

850
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,099
think so but I would need to check uh

851
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,140
the other question was about the

852
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,799
mythology sorry

853
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,260
um the second question one is the basis

854
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,920
of your scholarly work uh in reference

855
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,800
to existing technology the second was

856
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,260
you made a statement about complexity

857
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,079
and delays and you haven't presented

858
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,920
that material yet is that in your draft

859
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,320
uh I did not make a claim uh that that's

860
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
the case I say that the the evidence I

861
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,740
find suggests that that could be the

862
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,320
case yes whether you suggest or not you

863
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
must have some sort of basis on which

864
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,020
that suggestion is made so I'm asking is

865
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,060
that in your paper

866
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,359
um since you didn't cover it here

867
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,880
uh there are a bunch of things that

868
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,160
point in that direction but again are

869
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,680
I don't think that I could claim that

870
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,200
it's harder to publish because uh that's

871
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,920
a uh that's a judgment based on evidence

872
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,839
but what I can say is that it takes

873
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,339
longer to publish it takes much more

874
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,640
drops and up a few other bits point in

875
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,980
that direction as well I I would suggest

876
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,020
that perhaps you need to dig a little

877
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,240
deeper in that last statement because

878
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,300
there are several steps between a

879
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,240
working group internet draft to working

880
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,420
group approval to isg approval to RFC

881
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,099
everywhere and all of these have

882
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,240
different float so I hope you're uh

883
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,280
draft will give us more details thank

884
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,740
you yeah you can find it in the paper I

885
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,359
work with Colin Perkins which is quite

886
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,180
aware of the Dynamics of the ITF so uh

887
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,220
we are aware of our processes

888
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,220
hi up to save time I'll stand here

889
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,800
um did you say I just want to make sure

890
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,300
I heard you right did you say that

891
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,280
you're seeing more collaborative

892
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,940
terminology used in recent stuff uh no

893
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,359
uh what I said is that they people who

894
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,579
have more influence according to the

895
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,720
metric that we use seem to use uh types

896
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,220
of vocabulary that are aligned with

897
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,740
collaborative work more than the others

898
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,160
thank you

899
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,420
Jeff has I have a question and an

900
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,300
observation my question is do you have a

901
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,940
flavor of the graphs that are sub-sorted

902
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,060
by working group by age of the working

903
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,040
group sorry I I think I'm a little bit

904
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,520
deaf can you shout of it do you have a

905
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,680
version of your graphs that are

906
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,920
done by working group by age of the

907
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,619
working group no no I don't okay the

908
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,079
observation I will give is that

909
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,420
it's possible that the difficulty you're

910
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,859
seeing and the trajectories you're

911
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,380
seeing are based on new working groups

912
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,740
move fast they put out rfcs more often

913
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,960
and they have no fewer considerations

914
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,700
about having to worry about backward

915
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,339
compatibility for changing so that

916
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:48,839
probably is one of your inputs to your

917
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,540
trajectory so re-running your uh graphs

918
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,420
based on working groups by age may give

919
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,240
you a different set of graphs yeah and

920
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,700
this is the related pieces influence as

921
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,780
well

922
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,820
influence matters you know because you

923
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,500
have a long deployed thing so something

924
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,180
like bgp which has been around for about

925
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,099
30 years has different considerations

926
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,140
than say sapnet that's been around for a

927
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,220
year

928
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,440
yeah yeah no no I completely agree and I

929
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,760
mean one of the problems that we face is

930
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,859
that uh even though I'm quite well aware

931
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,920
of a bunch of our areas I'm not aware of

932
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,720
them all and certainly I cannot

933
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,780
consistently classify Technologies and

934
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,700
drafts uh easily and that's one of the

935
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,780
reasons why I was saying that they're

936
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,119
grown truth in some uh stuff is really

937
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,560
required because it's very difficult to

938
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,000
classify things so I can't classify it

939
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,220
in areas and we're even trying to look

940
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,000
at the uh emerging Technologies but uh

941
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
what are the definition of scientific or

942
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,040
consistent definition that we could use

943
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,079
of that is a very tricky thing and

944
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,520
that's also why for example I want to

945
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,980
look at the rfcs that have been deployed

946
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,180
because it's very different something

947
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,040
that gets deployed from something that

948
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,560
is not but my intuition is exactly the

949
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,480
same right I think you'll find that if

950
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,060
you just simply redo the numbers by the

951
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,560
age of the mailing list how long the

952
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,000
mailing list has been along that will be

953
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,020
a good proxy yeah

954
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,500
the most interesting graph in this this

955
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,260
presentation seemed was the number of

956
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,220
email participants because it showed

957
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,320
the number of email participants going

958
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,359
down well

959
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,839
the amount of output seems to be not

960
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,640
going down

961
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,560
so

962
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,020
I was wondering about what youth what we

963
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,160
are thinking about that are we

964
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,440
interacting in other modes or

965
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,440
with fewer people interacting

966
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,119
uh so

967
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,380
It's tricky to say because there are a

968
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,260
lot of emails uh so indeed it seems like

969
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,839
the number of yearly participants is uh

970
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:52,380
on decline with a bit of our Cycles uh

971
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,940
but the number of females remains

972
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,859
consistent there are several things

973
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,839
interacting at the same time

974
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,980
and there is an increasing number of

975
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,960
automated emails

976
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,240
as you probably know uh but that does

977
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,099
not change the Trends on the other hand

978
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,420
you have some working groups that are

979
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,760
increasingly relying on GitHub

980
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,480
uh quick for example but it's not a

981
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,700
is not a majority in the idea of a

982
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,619
contrary to the Web Consortium I've

983
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,800
looked at those numbers and uh

984
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,640
I don't think it would change the trend

985
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,740
so you think it's showing a real decline

986
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,200
in number of people

987
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,079
that's what I I I cannot find any

988
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,240
evidence that this cards that but again

989
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,000
it's my emails so I cannot have a let's

990
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,220
say full grasp on it but yeah it does

991
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,560
seem that the ITF is becoming chatted

992
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,500
so that it might be a judgment but yeah

993
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,220
so the other question was uh yesterday

994
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,980
how does this uh this observations

995
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,839
relate to the

996
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:58,500
subject title of the presentation do you

997
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,020
think that the IDF is becoming more

998
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,220
ossified

999
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,500
I really don't know that to be frank is

1000
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,960
a question for you guys that have a

1001
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,280
better advantage and understanding I'm

1002
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,720
looking at the numbers and I have a

1003
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,760
rough understanding of summaries of the

1004
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,180
ITF but I'm not fully embedded on it uh

1005
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,800
but the numbers that I find look a

1006
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,020
little bit uh you might have seen

1007
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,359
studies of Wikipedia that they over the

1008
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,200
time there's an increasing

1009
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,880
characterization because the structure

1010
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,700
grows more on the let's say explosive

1011
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,060
moment of emergence uh it's over so

1012
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,920
there are some similarities with those

1013
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,560
Trends uh is that the case uh it's

1014
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,440
really hard to say I'm probably uh it

1015
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,359
really depends on which specific moments

1016
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,160
you are looking at because the ITF goes

1017
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,780
a little bit in Cycles right like a

1018
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,060
suddenly Voiceover IP is a new thing and

1019
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,160
there is a huge way for follow drafts

1020
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,020
that are related to that instant Rising

1021
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,240
that technology so if suddenly next year

1022
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,400
or in the next five years there is an

1023
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,380
emergence of something completely new we

1024
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,200
could see very different Dynamics

1025
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,000
okay so

1026
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,480
um when I see a question asked I I kind

1027
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,060
of go is there a hint at announcer and

1028
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,980
the answer seems to be we don't know yet

1029
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,000
thank you uh the answer is not given but

1030
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,099
evidence uh that can support uh uh uh an

1031
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,380
answer into that question is there

1032
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,319
this is a work in progress

1033
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,800
yeah custom moment um there certainly is

1034
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,420
a strong perception with many people

1035
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,960
that the number of emails have gone up

1036
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,780
in some form

1037
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,280
there is also a perception that the

1038
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,020
number of emails that are actually being

1039
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,220
read

1040
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,118
is going down and

1041
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,300
I'm wondering whether we we have of

1042
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,280
course we cannot ask people whether they

1043
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,560
have red mail or something like that but

1044
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,540
if there may be a proxy we could use to

1045
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,480
find out more about this effect like

1046
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,339
finding out whether the email has been

1047
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,200
replied to I mean this is a pretty bad

1048
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,660
proxy but maybe the best way we actually

1049
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,300
have so I would be interested in more

1050
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,800
information about that yeah I know

1051
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,359
that's a very good point I presume that

1052
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,900
if the number of people uh it's in time

1053
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,220
and the number of emails say gross

1054
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,560
unless people suddenly grow increasing

1055
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,079
capability of attention and time uh the

1056
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,700
number of emails ready should be

1057
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,380
declining uh I guess that there are

1058
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,579
things that they could be look at now

1059
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,500
like the number of replies and the

1060
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,599
amount of content in the replies as a

1061
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,060
potential metric indicating engagement

1062
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,880
uh we're labeling now some conversations

1063
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,339
uh for agreement disagreement and a few

1064
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:35,160
other uh simple tags that they can help

1065
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,480
understand what's going on in that

1066
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,819
conversation and hopefully that might

1067
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:40,079
help a little bit to have an

1068
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,579
understanding of something like a okay

1069
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:46,200
density of conversations and how much

1070
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,800
engagement the animal creates

1071
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,720
yeah what what interesting aspect of

1072
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,359
email not being read

1073
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,180
um if an email is just not read that's

1074
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,500
one thing

1075
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,579
um if people who haven't read the emails

1076
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:05,280
continue contributing to the thread

1077
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,200
that can lead to very interesting

1078
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,780
discussions and that has wasted a lot of

1079
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,220
time in a lot of cases

1080
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,740
I wouldn't know how could I uh compute

1081
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,579
that yeah that's very fair point

1082
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:22,800
a quick question sorry if I miss that

1083
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,260
what kind of mailing lists you were

1084
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,119
looking at are you excluding the idea of

1085
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,420
discuss for example uh I think that we

1086
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,540
were including them all but uh if I if I

1087
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,579
remember nobody if I remember the

1088
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,380
overwhelming majority of the emails

1089
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,800
comes from the working group of from the

1090
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,099
working group mail lists so anything

1091
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,319
that would happen in this Casa would not

1092
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,140
alter the findings but to be frank I

1093
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,760
would have to check because I I don't

1094
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,619
remember I recall that we did we

1095
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,000
excluded a few

1096
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,500
because I think it's completely

1097
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,400
different Dynamics yes

1098
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,599
okay uh with that thank you very much

1099
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,460
Ignacio

1100
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,520
um

1101
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,260
while uh Greg wood is coming up uh in

1102

1106
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,880
hot and in a closed room uh remember

1107
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,280
that uh accurate numbers on how many

1108

1114
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,980
one is that we're moving to a new Wiki

1115
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,140
platform and one of the things we want

1116
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,339
to do is make sure to get all the

1117
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,319
working group con working group wikis

1118
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:52,200
onto the new platform a few of you uh

1119

1125
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,460

nice things and also the plan currently

1130
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,480
is to discontinue track

1131
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,420
uh supporting track as a web service uh

1132
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,660
in the nourish future so

1133
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,819
um you definitely do do need to make the

1134
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:33,720
move

1135
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,500
um so that's number one and uh

1136
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,000
and you can grab me during the meeting

1137
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,859
here as well if you happen to be on site

1138
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,560
or happy to take email uh second one I

1139
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,780
wanted to bring up was that we are

1140
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,420
reprising a new and improved version of

1141
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,280
the working group chairs training that

1142
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,260
we did last year we got very very

1143
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,480
positive feedback on that training from

1144
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,359
last year and also a lot of really good

1145
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,560
suggestions about how to make it better

1146
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,079
and we're doing that thanks to input

1147
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,420
from uh folks in the community I see

1148
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,359
Barry here he's active Roman denwu also

1149
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:08,579
uh providing good good input and a few

1150
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:12,240
others through doting and so forth so I

1151
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,300
really encourage you to sign up uh the

1152
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,579
links won't work on uh if you just point

1153
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:19,319
at that screen there but they will work

1154
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:22,980
if you go to the chairs uh dot iitf.org

1155
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,980
training and uh you can just sign up um

1156
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,280
uh uh clarification is some confusion

1157
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,640
sometimes we have three classes we have

1158
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,720
two

1159
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,819
um sessions of each class so you only

1160
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,200
need to sign up for one session for each

1161
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,540
class us and you don't need to sign up

1162
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,920
for every class so you can pick and

1163
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,880
choose for what works for you and I'm

1164
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,680
also happy to answer questions about

1165
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,740
that the last thing is we're um if you

1166
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,540
can't make any of those we are

1167
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,380
definitely holding a uh or developing an

1168
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,960
on-demand version that will be more than

1169
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,660
just videos uh that are an hour long so

1170
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,000
those will also be new and approved

1171
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,920
again ask me questions if I can answer

1172
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,140
any any questions you have or provide

1173
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,040
more info thanks

1174
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,619
foreign

1175
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,359
does he need to come back

1176
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,020
I'm not sure anything here

1177
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,359
actually this is this is just more of a

1178
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,839
comment um Jim Fenton uh just to point

1179
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,839
out if anybody doesn't realize ITF is

1180
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,180
you know has brought in outside trainers

1181
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,060
professional trainers to give the uh to

1182
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,099
give the chairs training and they're

1183
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:58,740
getting a lot of input from several of

1184
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,740
us uh on what the content should be so

1185
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,200
that it's not just as standard you know

1186
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,180
resolving conflict thing that it really

1187
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,940
addresses the ietf way of doing things

1188
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,260
so

1189
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,359
um you know any of you that would

1190
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:14,579
benefit from the training

1191
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:18,060
um I I just want to emphasize that ietf

1192
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,040
considers this important because they're

1193
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,260
they're hiring people to do it so please

1194
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,480
take advantage

1195
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,400
yeah actually as I'm standing here I

1196
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,960
also took some of the trainings and I

1197
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,000
think like one of the um most valuable

1198
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,560
Parts was also that just having a

1199
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,880
discussion with the other chairs on

1200
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,740
these topics during the trainings was

1201
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,180
super well you just exchange them ideas

1202
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,680
how do you handle the situation like

1203
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,680
this so I don't think the video that

1204
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,880
will show up will give you the same

1205
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,680
thing

1206
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,540
um but that's not why I'm here I can

1207
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,880
yeah perfect so like as you're all here

1208
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,020
I take I thought I'd take the

1209
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,400
opportunity and talk about something

1210
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,500
that we're working on

1211
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,660
um so I'm I've been studying this

1212
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,119
initiative because when I

1213
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,059
um started as a chair at some point it

1214
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,980
was really confusing to me like how to

1215
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,599
use the data track at best and that's

1216
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,160
not necessary because the data track is

1217
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,780
so confusing it's just like well it's

1218
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,760
hard to use it's just like I didn't even

1219
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,859
know of all of these features that are

1220
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,300
in the data tracker and like how other

1221
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,800
chairs are using them and what's the

1222
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,619
great best way to use them so in order

1223
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,300
to address this problem maybe a little

1224
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,280
bit and what we've been trying to do is

1225
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,740
trying to create some quick

1226
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,200
start how-to guides like this is like as

1227
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,020
a example shows here it's like a kind of

1228
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,359
I don't know six step guides how to

1229
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,040
adopt a document which buttons to click

1230
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,960
and what are the steps

1231
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,480
um so um this document these how-to

1232
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,980
guides were actually not hard to create

1233
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,440
it was like not a lot of effort

1234
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,819
um but what took more time is to figure

1235
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,040
out what other things that we want to

1236
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,420
create those guides about and I think

1237
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,119
this is also one of the big values um

1238
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,619
hopefully that you will get out of it

1239
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,540
even if you

1240
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,059
um use the data track kind of

1241
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:55,559
extensively looking at these guides you

1242
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:57,059
might actually know what other functions

1243
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,040
are available and then you may or may

1244
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,440
not use the guide to actually do it

1245
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,079
so and that's what we're doing and the

1246
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,700
three examples that are on the slide I

1247
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,040
think those are already online Greg

1248
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,619
where did you go

1249
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,500
soon very soon

1250
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,140
um on the um

1251
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,760
chairs.itf.org page

1252
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,520
um and we are working on a few more

1253
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,020
um and we would need your input if

1254
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,819
that's actually helpful for you and if

1255
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,640
we should like continue it

1256
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,200
um as I said there are a couple things

1257
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,900
to keep in mind one thing is I think a

1258
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,940
big value is just like having a list of

1259
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,619
these so you understand what's available

1260
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,300
in the data tracker you don't have to do

1261
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,619
it this way you don't have to use it

1262
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,619
this way but at least you know

1263
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,119
um the second thing is we are also

1264
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,220
providing just one way to use the data

1265
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,540
tracker or to go through the process

1266
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,339
there's like a lot of cases the process

1267
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:48,839
is very wide and that's also why the

1268
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:50,160
data tracker has all these different

1269
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,319
states and buttons so in these quick

1270
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,940
guides are intended to be quick so they

1271
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,680
give you exactly one way to do it that

1272
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,359
we in the small group we've been

1273
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,859
developing these things is like kind of

1274
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,420
the most common way to use it but like

1275
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,040
of course you don't have to do it that

1276
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,059
way

1277
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,920
and I think the third thing to keep in

1278
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,500
mind is also that the data tracker is

1279
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,540
not only there to support you in your

1280
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,040
management of the working group I think

1281
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,540
that's like one of the main tests but it

1282
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,460
does also have the participants if you

1283
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,260
put some information in the data tracker

1284
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,059
and they can look it up so that's also

1285
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:19,800
something we've been trying to address

1286
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,020
that's it so watch out for it provide us

1287
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,760
feedback provide us feedback about the

1288
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,160
existing guides and what other guides

1289
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,839
are used for

1290
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,880
um open Boxer sent me email or if you

1291
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,380
want to participate also let me know

1292
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,160
yeah and then as I'm standing here very

1293
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,960
quick note about something that we

1294
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,660
discussed this morning on the IHG

1295
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,960
um so we we discussed this problem uh

1296
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,540
that we have this online humming tool

1297
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,800
which is not an online Hamming tool

1298
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,540
right like some people say it's a voting

1299
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,520
tool and it's also sometimes confusing

1300
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,680
and so on so this is just a reminder

1301
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,480
that it's actually not supposed to be a

1302
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,400
Hammington not supposed to be voting to

1303
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,859
because we're not voting so it is really

1304
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,780
helpful even if people see the number on

1305
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,059
the screens that you if you're sharing a

1306
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:08,099
session make clear that this is not the

1307
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:09,240
decision-making process the

1308
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,700
decision-making process is taking this

1309
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,780
boat

1310
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,260
s input to the rough consensus judgment

1311
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,400
that you're making and actually

1312
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,980
expressing that to the audience to your

1313
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,660
group is really important so that's just

1314
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,259
a very quick reminder

1315
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,440
thank you

1316
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:34,920
all right so um I missed an item on the

1317
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,599
agenda this is working group chair fail

1318
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,460
here but uh Charles did you want to come

1319
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,300
up

1320
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,140
sorry about that

1321
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,540
what is he going to talk about

1322
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,760
yeah actually uh you know that was

1323
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,559
really good ordering because I think one

1324
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,800
of the uh quick guides there was about

1325
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,380
uh using additional what was it called

1326
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,839
additional resources in the data tracker

1327
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:09,180
and uh my favorite one that I've

1328
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,099
mentioned you at the last working group

1329
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,079
chair meeting I wanted to mention again

1330
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,579
because that's relatively new and I

1331
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,859
think it's important is the related

1332
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:18,300
implementations

1333
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,059
and I just had a couple slides here for

1334
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,440
those of you who haven't done it I don't

1335
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,760
know if this is the way that the quick

1336
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,280
guide uh shows but this is just two two

1337
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,380
screenshots one that kind of shows where

1338
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,599
it appears on the data tracker screen

1339
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:34,079
you have these additional resources and

1340
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,599
one of them that you can add if you go

1341
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,220
to the next slide

1342
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,500
is you can

1343
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,619
uh put in related implementations and

1344
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,599
you actually have a lot of freedom in

1345
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,240
terms of exactly what text string you

1346
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,900
put there and and where say the link if

1347
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,059
you put a link and and what that points

1348
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,520
to we haven't formalized that as to

1349
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,880
what's the best thing to do some people

1350
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,160
point to a readme that lists multiple

1351
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,619
different resources some people put one

1352
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:07,800
of these for each resource

1353
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,579
um

1354
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,740
one of the things I think would be good

1355
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,280
for us to think about is do we want to

1356
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,420
recommend a certain way of doing this

1357
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,740
um and then the second thing would be

1358
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,500
for at least currently anyone can use

1359
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,140
this and add this for a an individual

1360
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,040
draft

1361
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,839
they're in charge they have the ability

1362
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:33,599
to put this if once it's a working group

1363
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,760
draft then they they need the help of

1364
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,280
the working group chair to add this

1365
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,200
I don't think that's necessarily a bad

1366
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,760
thing I just wanted to point out that's

1367
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,040
that's the way it currently works and if

1368
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,079
we think that's you know appropriate in

1369
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,420
the way it should stay great and I

1370
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,420
believe for rfcs it's kind of similar

1371
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:54,059
that if a working group if the working

1372
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:57,359
group that uh is tied to that RFC still

1373
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,339
exists well then that working group

1374
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:02,339
those chairs can actually uh add this

1375
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:05,160
for an RFC I believe

1376
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,760
um otherwise I assume it goes to you

1377
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,740
know you have to bug one of the the

1378
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,440
people who who are really uh making

1379
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,119
changes to the data tracker and maybe

1380
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,339
they have some super user skills there

1381
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:20,040
so they can help you out

1382
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,040
um Hank yeah so hi this is Hank

1383
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,599
um so my first question would be how is

1384
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,400
this related to BCP 205

1385
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,720
implementation status

1386
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,720
as a guidance how to uh reference that

1387
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,319
in an ID that will go away when this is

1388
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:40,800
becoming an RFC or for post standard

1389
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,619
so um at the moment

1390
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:45,000
um it's not a big problem we are

1391
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,040
referring to one GitHub thing there's

1392
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,140
one contact we have a select one of the

1393
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,079
study uh we would have

1394
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,059
the future problem that there will be

1395
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:55,859
multiple

1396
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:57,720
um the BCP is not super clear on that

1397
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,880
this seems to be connected to all of

1398
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,920
this but you know that update we the

1399
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,680
result of this manifest in an update of

1400
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,740
PCP 205 that would be great for example

1401
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,780
okay yeah I think that that's a good

1402
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,880
point there's a there's actually a draft

1403
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,579
that I wrote that I think is expired now

1404
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,640
it's in the EDM working group that kind

1405
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,040
of looks at what are the various

1406
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,140
mechanisms that we have out right now

1407
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,740
for kind of for relating code to our

1408
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,660
drafts what you mentioned the

1409
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,599
implementation status is is an option I

1410
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:33,000
know a lot of people strip that out as

1411
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,280
part of your your document becoming an

1412
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,839
RFC the RFC editor kind of things

1413
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:42,119
typically we remove this is that okay if

1414
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,339
you don't want it you need to you know

1415
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:47,339
kind of get your ad approval of that I

1416
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,559
see so

1417
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,260
um you know the the implementation

1418
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,819
status generally means the

1419
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:55,980
implementation like that's a little more

1420
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,559
narrow focused in a way than just

1421
00:58:58,559 --> 00:58:59,880
related implementation because that's

1422
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,460
related implementation might just be a

1423
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,559
tool that helps you with debugging the

1424
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,240
deployment you know in case someone ever

1425
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,480
does implement your job your RFC so I

1426
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,880
think it's that they're they're not uh

1427
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,920
they're related but they aren't

1428
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,200
duplicates of each other yeah but but

1429
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,380
the the alleged theme Here is

1430
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,240
um landing pages

1431
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,280
so the data tracker could be a landing

1432
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,799
page for an RFC and its implementation

1433
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:28,020
so that you can find them at the tracker

1434
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,000
because the RFC is someone is like

1435
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,119
sealed uh same way for the

1436
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,760
implementation status uh the link there

1437
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,460
doesn't have to be the implementation it

1438
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,220
can be a landing page pointing again to

1439
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,380
various implementations I think that's

1440
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,960
the theme both share and the could be

1441
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,579
reflected in some ways

1442
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:48,480
okay

1443
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,520
okay yep good point and if anyone else

1444
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,040
is interested in maybe uh working with

1445
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,819
me on Reviving that uh the the draft

1446
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:59,460
that's an EDM we can

1447
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,579
figure out how to move that forward

1448
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,500
that's it okay

1449
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,579
um unfortunately I've had to go ahead

1450
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:07,500
and close the queue because it's 12 up

1451
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,500
just turned to 12 45 so at this point uh

1452
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,000
the meeting is adjourned thank you very

1453
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,619
much for coming please take your garbage

1454
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:15,780
and take any questions to the mailing

1455
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,380
list rubbish rubbish remove remove your

1456
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,280
rubbish from the room

1457
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,280
so this is cool it's the actual ietf AV

1458
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,319
plan

1459
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:33,660
it's very neat give it a Jerry but yeah

1460
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,760
it's cool shows like the view of the

1461
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,400
speak the microphones the cameras along

1462
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,000
very neat

1463
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,879
