um as a covert safety measure

84
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,560
um the in-person participants in this

85
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,580
meeting

86
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,860
um and in in the other ITF controlled

87
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,220
rooms are required to wear ffp2 and 95

88
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,639
masks with the exception of

89
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,380
um the chairs of the meeting and the

90
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,060
presenters who are standing in the front

91
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,180
and actively speaking I think for this

92
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,800
meeting it is also permitted to remove

93
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,780
your your mask briefly while asking

94
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,880
questions from the microphones

95
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,460
if everyone in the audience uh you are

96
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,560
required to wear your mask at all times

97
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,400
all right so the the goals of the irtf

98
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,620
and this is an irtf session rather than

99
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,900
an ietf session

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,120
uh the goals of the IIT effort to focus

101
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
on some of the longer term research

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,759
issues

103
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,780
um

104
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,639
we're here to

105
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,819
um think about where um things might be

106
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,280
going to discuss some of the the the

107
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,680
bigger picture issues that the longer

108
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,539
term issues um

109
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,460
perhaps as a way of feeding into the

110
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,560
standards process that the ATF is doing

111
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,020
perhaps as a way of for the research

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,879
Community to learn from the standards

113
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,580
process in the SEF and learn from the

114
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,860
experience of the people in the ITF

115
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,099
community

116
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,099
the irtf is a research organization we

117
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,700
don't develop standards and as a result

118
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,799
while we can publish informational or an

119
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,440
experimental rfcs the primary research

120
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,720
outputs from the the and the primary

121
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
outputs from the irtf tend to be more in

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
the form of research papers than in the

123
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
form of rfcs

124
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,500
question

125
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,220
iitf is organized as a number of

126
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,779
research groups

127
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,540
um the the slide here though those in

128

um which are discussing uh work which

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,200
might form potential new research groups

157
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,779
and you may have seen some some email I

158
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,279
sent to the

159
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,040
um attendees list and to the ITF

160
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,899
discussion list we've got a site meeting

161
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,080
tomorrow lunchtime in the Richmond six

162
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,360
room and that room has changed from the

163
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,580
initial announcement which will be

164
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,160
looking at usable formal methods uh and

165
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,660
there's there's been a number of people

166
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,760
who've contacted me expressing interest

167
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,040
in this so

168
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
um I think we we should have an

169
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,860
interesting discussion about uh whether

170
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,140
it makes sense to create a a new

171
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,000
research group in the space of formal

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,040
methods and usability of formal methods

173
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,740
uh for protocol specification in the ITF

174
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,519
community

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,660
um another meeting which is happening at

176
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,440
I think 3 30 tomorrow in mezzanine 12 is

177
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,079
a potential a meeting to discuss a

178
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,880
potential research group into

179
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,500
researching the internet standards

180
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,579
process

181
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,100
and Neil's turnover is leading this

182
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,959
effort um

183
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,540
this follows on from a workshop the

184
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,300
internet architecture board organized

185
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,220
um I think it was late last year

186
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,820
um

187
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,360
where a number of people were exploring

188
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,640
um the data we can extract from the data

189
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,079
tracker and the mailing list archives

190
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,620
and trying to understand the process by

191
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,660
which the ITF develops standards and

192
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,860
understand that the shifts in

193
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,660
demographics and the shifts in in the

194
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,720
way the process works uh to to get some

195
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,000
better understanding of um

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,040
who helped set standards and how

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,260
effective the standard setting process

198
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,880
is

199
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
um so if you're interested in that topic

200
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,019
please go along to the the meeting Niels

201
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,420
is organizing tomorrow at 3 30.

202
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,540
uh as I said the earlier the irtf can

203
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,640
produce rfcs

204
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,320
um

205
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,540
this uh the last meeting cycle since uh

206
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,820
since the summer meeting in July has

207
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,740
actually been one of our more productive

208
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,920
cycles for producing rfcs and uh I think

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,720
this is the most rfcs I have to report

210
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,600
uh in in the four years I've been irtf

211
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,220
chair

212
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,959
um and we've published five rfcs in the

213
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,700
last cycle uh a couple from the

214
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,440
intent-based networking research group

215
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,680
looking at uh intent classification and

216
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,120
Concepts and definitions for

217
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,940
intent-based networking

218
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,500
um a couple relating to information

219
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,300
Centric networking

220
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,700
um looking at integration of ICN

221
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,579
protocols with 4G mobile networks and

222
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,019
looking at the integration with network

223
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,880
coding protocols

224
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
and another another protocol looking at

225
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
Network coding and photo error

226
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,779
correction and its relation to

227
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,940
congestion control and transport

228
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,579
so please do take a look at those rfcs

229
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,579
in addition to the research groups

230
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,940
we organize a couple of other activities

231
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,300
in the irtf the main focus of today is

232
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,040
the applied networking research price

233
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,480
the applied networking research process

234
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,160
something we organize in conjunction

235
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,260

um that might be of uh when you're

244
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,100
coming out of the research community

245
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,079
that might be relevant to the internet

246
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,120

00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,980
where he was advised by Jeffrey volcker

342
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,039
and Stefan Savage and Casey clefey

343
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,780
uh he primarily works on the

344
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,299
intersection of security and large-scale

345
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,299
network measurements and his recent work

346
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,760
has looked at the security of DNS TLS

347
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,799
and routing

348
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,840
and if you find this work interesting I

349
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
think you're talking in map RG tomorrow

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,340
is it yes yes

351
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,200
um where you'll be it's

352
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,280
um

353
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,080
um something about the the impact of the

354
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,600
conflict on the Russian DNS is there

355
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,820
yeah like um it's basically us looking

356
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,720
at the hosting DNS and DLS landscape

357
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,580
after

358
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,740
um the February Invasion at so it's

359
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,260
called where are you cleverly enough so

360
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,400
yeah

361
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,900
okay so if you find this interesting

362
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,059
please also go on to my party tomorrow

363
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,280
and with that I'll hand over it's good

364
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,039
awesome okay thank you

365
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,919
um my name is Gautama kiwate and I'm a

366
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,559
postdoctoral researcher at Stanford

367
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,740
University and and the only reason that

368
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,419
it doesn't make it up on the slide is

369
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,500
because

370
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,120
um I did this work when I was a PhD

371
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,760
student at UC San Diego advised by

372
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,820
Stefan Jeff and Casey who I'm told some

373
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,440
of you know

374
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,880
so

375
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,140
um at a high level this paper is a story

376
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,360
of how well-meaning standards can

377
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,220
encourage operational practices that

378
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,840
lead to issues

379
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,640
and while I'm primarily going to talk

380
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,940
about this Risky Business paper I am

381
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,640
also going to sort of uh a lot of work

382
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,940
has happened after the paper came out

383
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,559
and we've worked on some of the adjacent

384
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,299
issues so I'm going to sort of zoom out

385
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,520
a little bit and talk about some of the

386
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,980
follow-up work that we have done to sort

387
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,299
of think about Solutions more

388
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,000
holistically

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,820
foreign

390
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,100
so this work essentially started as a

391
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,440
result of two Mysteries the first

392
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,260
mystery was a classic whodunit mystery

393
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,600
and the victim in this case was the

394
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,240
White County judges official County

395
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
domain whitecounty.net

396
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,620
and what we saw was in July of uh 2019

397
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,799
um one of the name servers

398
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,620
ns2.internetemc.com was replaced with

399
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,419
ns2.internet EMC random characters that

400
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:58,740
biz

401
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,900
what was surprising about this domain

402
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
was that internet EMC random characters

403
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,840
that Biz was not registered which means

404
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,720
that an attacker could go register this

405
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,299
dot base domain and be the authoritative

406
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,660
name server for a county domain and the

407
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,820
implications of that were troubling

408
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,520
so we started wondering why did the name

409
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,260
server change who changed the name

410
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,679
server and if this was accidental was

411
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
this a typo or was this something more

412
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
systemic

413
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,580
the second mystery that we saw was uh

414
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,260
something we called drop this host

415
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,400
anomaly

416
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,640
and in this we saw that when we were

417
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,620
looking at the Zone files for nine years

418
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,320
worth of Zone files we found 33 of the

419
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,840
name service ending in dot Biz where of

420
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,940
the form drop this host random

421
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,559
characters dot base

422
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,480
and that was odd

423
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,520
so as an example

424
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,740
um here's an example for

425
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,600
yourgadgetnews.com we saw its name

426
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
service ns1 and ns2 known ub.com being

427
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,480
replaced by drop this host string of

428
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
random characters dot biz

429
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,760
and again we found ourselves asking why

430
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,500
did the name server change who changed

431
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,559
the name servers and in this case uh

432
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,380
given the large numbers we realized it

433
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,380
must be something systemic like these

434
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,440
can't beat typos anymore

435
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,840
and in order to understand this better

436
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,539
uh in order to understand how these name

437
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,820
servers get changed we first needed to

438
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,580
understand how these name servers get

439
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,559
propagated the DNS configuration gets

440
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,140
propagated behind the scenes and

441
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,340
essentially we're trying to understand

442
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,400
how the DNS configuration flows from the

443
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,740
registrant which is the domain owner who

444
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,559
nominally operates uh the the child Zone

445
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,780
to the registry which operates the

446
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,700
parent Zone and we found that the

447
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,159
registrar plays a central role in this

448
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,720
propagation

449
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,900
so the registrant

450
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,179
communicates the any name server changes

451
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,159
to the registrar using this web portal

452
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,299
or an API and the registrar in turn uses

453
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,460
this protocol called extensible

454
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,880
provisioning protocol Epp and to

455
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,200
communicate these changes to the

456
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,340
registry

457
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,039
and given that these were large numbers

458
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,840
and given that this was a systemic

459
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,980
issues

460
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,480
um we figured that there must be

461
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,720
something amiss with Epp and also the

462
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,039
fact that we didn't understand anything

463
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,340
about Epp so

464
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:29,940
um

465
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,179
what I'd like to do next uh with

466
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,000
um apologies to all of the um to Steve

467
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,100
Hollenbeck who actually wrote the RFC on

468
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,520
Epp is to create a simplified mental

469
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,840
model of what Epp is and to sort of use

470
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,600
that simplified mental model to sort of

471
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,360
work through how Epp constraints can

472
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,000
actually lead to this issue and again

473
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,179
the apologies to add the actual Experts

474
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,059
of RFC in the room so a good place to

475
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,280
start is to think of the registry top

476
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,320
level domain DNS configuration as a

477
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,419
database so all of the domain objects

478
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,520
the name service to think of them as a

479
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,919
database and this database has two sorts

480
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,320
of objects the first is a domain object

481
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,360
such as food.com

482
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,360
and the second is a host object and

483
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,039
every host object that belongs to the

484
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,679
same top level domain such as

485
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,820
ns1.food.com needs to have a

486
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,220
relationship with the domain object in

487
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,080
this case

488
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,460
ns1.food.com is a subordinate host

489
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,440
object of food.com

490
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,299
and once you have that

491
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,539
you can then think of

492
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,840
Epp as the specification on how this

493
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,419
database can be modified okay again

494
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,799
simplified metal model new apologies

495
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,380
okay with that mental model let's work

496
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,679
through uh an example to see how um how

497
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,640
we can get ourselves into uh problems

498
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,700
so consider two domain objects one

499
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,220
food.com registered by registrar a

500
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,520
bar.com registered by register B

501
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,039
we next introduced the subordinate host

502
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,340
objects ns1 and ns2.food.com for

503
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,860
food.com which is abundant host objects

504
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,500
of food.com and ns1.bar.com which is

505
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,320
about init host objective power.com we

506
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,600
also show the delegated name server

507
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,760
relationships and each of these domains

508
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,940
has two delegated name servers as is

509
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,440
required

510
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,440
and what is uh the thing to keep in mind

511
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,720
here is that bar.com

512
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,240
um is has delegated its name service to

513
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,700
a host object that is controlled by

514
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,740
another registrar and that in itself is

515
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,440
not a problem this happens all the time

516
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,600
designed for it and everything works

517
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,620
fine till food.com expires when food.com

518
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,620
expires registry would like to sort of

519
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,500
purge it from the database if you will

520
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,419
in order to stop paying the registry for

521
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,900
the domain

522
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,760
um in order to do that EPP requires that

523
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,700
the registrar first clean up all of the

524
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,840
uh Associated uh host objects so the

525
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,840
register goes and cleans up ns1.food.com

526
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,419
without any problems

527
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,940
um but as you can some of you might have

528
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,120
already anticipated when the register

529
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,880
tries to go and delete ns2.food.com it

530
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,100
cannot do so because it is being

531
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,620
referenced by another domain object and

532
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,960
hence cannot be deleted now this is a

533
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,820
domain object that is controlled by

534
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,700
another registrar and so the register at

535
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,980
this point of time has two options one

536
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,179
is

537
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,159
um not really an option because like

538
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,900
it's to suck it up

539
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,179
and just keep the domain as is in the

540
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,279
registry database but in this case it

541
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
means that it needs to continue paying

542
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,419
for this domain even though it has

543
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,760
stopped getting paid for it

544
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,700
the um and so this is not really an

545
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,299
option and Epp sort of foresees this and

546
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,820
presents a workaround which is to rename

547
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,279
the host object so

548
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,500
what does this renaming look like what

549
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,000
are some of the constraints around this

550
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,559
renaming

551
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,200
um and it turns out there are very

552
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,960
little constraints and like the the

553
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,419
primary constraint is that if the host

554
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,580
object is renamed within the same top

555
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,039
level domain Epp requires that the

556
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,620
domain object must exist so as a

557
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,380
concrete example

558
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,480
ns2.food.com cannot be renamed to drop

559
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
this host random characters.com If drop

560
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,880
this host random characters.com does not

561
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,200
exist

562
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,740
and given that EPP cannot check external

563
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,779
references like references to external

564
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,140
top level domains ns2.food.com can

565
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,880
totally be renamed to drop this host

566
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,279
random characters dot Biz because dot

567
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,440
base is an uh external top level domain

568
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,559
even if drop this is regardless of

569
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,700
whether drop the source random

570
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,740
characters dot base exists or not

571
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,679
and um these were the constraints and we

572
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,559
expected there to be a third which was

573
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,840
like just dropping the name server

574
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,880
altogether but having talked to

575
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,799
registrars and Registries it seems like

576
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,840
that is not really an option so like you

577
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,240
can just drop the name server like the

578
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,640
host object altogether so not entirely

579
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,460
sure why

580
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,900
so given those constraints the

581
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,120
registered now has two options the first

582
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,100
is to rename the name server to a sync

583
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,260
domain the sync domain is controlled by

584
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,720
registrar a this sort of guarantees that

585
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,120
the domain object always exists so that

586
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,520
the operation never fails but now the

587
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,460
registrar is on the hook for the queries

588
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,100
and upkeep of the sync domain

589
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,640
and this is actually a problem because

590
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,500
we at least know of multiple instances

591
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,380
where registrars abandoned their sync

592
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,480
domains exposing thousands of domains to

593
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,039
hijacks

594
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,500
um and and like this is a single domain

595
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,659
that an attacker can just register and

596
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,760
get all of these domains for free

597
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,820
the second option is to rename the name

598
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,919
server to a random domain in a different

599
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,659
top level domain

600
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,760
the different top-level domain is to

601
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,460
bypass the Epp check and the random

602
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,380
domain is so that you don't impinge on

603
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,000
an existing domain

604
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,039
and in this case like the registrar

605
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,299
doesn't really have to handle any

606
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,480
queries or keep any domains but as you

607
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,100
can as you might have figured out like

608
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,960
there is a potential for security risk

609
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,140
here

610
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,220
and of course because

611
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,919
um it's the internet we chose the the

612
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,260
second option which is to just dump it

613
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,200
into this random top level domain dot

614
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,899
base with a random domain and because of

615
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:46,080
this renaming the the host object is no

616
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,419
longer a subordinate host object of

617
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,640
food.com and the register can go ahead

618
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,039
and delete the domain and what we're

619
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,500
left with is a sacrificial name server

620
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,799
and by Design This is a random domain

621
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,100
which was it is not registered so an

622
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,500
attacker can now go in and register this

623
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,840
domain and be the authoritative name

624
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,600
server for bar.com without having any

625
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,940
ownership interest in bar.com

626
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,059
okay and we found that this mental model

627
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,399
actually explained most of the renamings

628
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,860
that we saw but then we started seeing

629
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,700
uh renamings that

630
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,919
affected.gov.edu.net and um

631
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,559
and we found that the one small tiny

632
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,000
adjustment that we needed to make in our

633
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,760
mental model that was that EPP instances

634
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,159
spanned multiple top level domains so

635
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,260
for example very science Epp

636
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:40,919
repositoriespants.com.gov.net.edu

637
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,260
amongst others and Affiliates for

638
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,799
example spans.org dot info and uh

639
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,919
amongst others so what we'll do is sort

640
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,100
of try to rework the example again to

641
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,820
see how this renaming affects domains

642
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,700
across multiple top level domains

643
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,880
so in this case we have a.com domain a

644
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,640
dot gov domain and a DOT org domain Each

645
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,100
of which uh delegates their name service

646
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,320
to ns2.food.com and like before food.com

647
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,559
expires and the registrar renames

648
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,960
Institute of food.com to drop this host

649
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,720
uh to to any student food random

650
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,580
characters dot Biz

651
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,720
um and

652
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,960
this renaming only affects the verisign

653
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,419
Epp repository because that's the scope

654
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,299
of it and on the other hand for the dot

655
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,799
org we are still left with a lame

656
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
delegation and each of us can be

657
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,200
registered and by an attacker to be the

658
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,360
authoritative name server for even a DOT

659
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,620
cup domain

660
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,779
so here's a quick summary of what we

661
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,659
have learned so far we found that EPP

662
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,580
consistency constraints led to

663
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,440
unintuitive consequences and domain

664
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,940
deletion

665
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,100
um the there were security risks without

666
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,440
any action from the domain owner and

667
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,240
this was completely opaque to The Domain

668
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,039
owner and even to the domain owners

669
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,539
registrar

670
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,059
and perhaps the most Insidious part of

671
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,720
this was that re-registering the

672
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,159
expiredomainfood.com does not really fix

673
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,799
the issue here and what was surprising

674
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,500
to us was that it affected even domains

675
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,720
in restricted top-level domains like dot

676
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,840
gov and Dot edu and we actually found a

677
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,880
couple and like the wonderful folks who

678
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,919
were at verisign and who I can see here

679
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,700
actually helped us remediate uh some of

680
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,779
them

681
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,760
or all of them

682
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,399
so given that we understood how this

683
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,140
happened we wanted to understand the

684
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,899
scope of this issue and do so

685
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,539
longitudinally so we used the three

686
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,399
properties of sacrificial name servers

687
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,559
which is not really important for this

688
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,020
presentation but we use this three

689
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,299
properties and sort of modified a

690
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,460
methodology to identify lame delegations

691
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,860
from one of our previous papers and

692
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,840
applied it to nine years worth of zones

693
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,320
files and in 1250 top level domains

694
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,120
um

695
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,100
and applied it to 20 million name

696
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,539
servers

697
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:09,899
and doing so we found uh quite a few

698
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,960
registrars actually indulging in it 180

699
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,760
000 name servers

700
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,340
um and half a million domains that were

701
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,880
affected as a result of these renamings

702
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,059
and I just want to say like all of these

703
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,760
registrars who we contacted were

704
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,179
actually super helpful and like helped

705
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,440
us understand the issue and actually

706
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,080
rectified all of it so this was

707
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,720
um this was great so what I know this

708
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,100
sounds this pains them in a bad light

709
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,840
but actually they were super helpful and

710
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,840
super photo so given that not only were

711
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,960
half a million domains affected but

712
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,480
nearly one-third of all of the domains

713
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,120
were hijacked by registering the

714
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,700
sacrificial name servers so not only

715
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,340
where these domains being exposed but

716
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,260
they were in fact being taken advantage

717
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,279
of

718
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,919
and these were not really sophisticated

719
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,799
hijacks and the hijackers essentially

720
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,200
were trying to get hold of these domains

721
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,440
in order to serve ads and uh where

722
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,359
search engine optimizations were the

723
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,159
other use case that we saw and

724
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,839
essentially these were opportunistic

725
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,839
hijacks so like basically

726
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,520
um there was nothing targeted there was

727
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,080
nothing malicious they saw this domain

728
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,520
being exposed

729
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,219
um and we see that domains uh attackers

730
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,619
trying to maximize how many domains that

731
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,599
they can get for a single registration

732
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,480
and uh in in the paper we have some sort

733
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,580
of value curve where we see attackers

734
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,560
trying to go for the high value domains

735
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,800
so given that we understand the scope of

736
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,418
this issue we wondered if we could

737
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,119
remediate help remediate this issue and

738
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,339
this remediation roughly takes two forms

739
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,040
the first is to prevent creation of new

740
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,980
sacrificial name servers and to do that

741
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,500
we worked with the the three registrars

742
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,359
with the largest impact

743
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,859
um to prevent creation of new

744
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,960
sacrificial name servers and each of

745
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,359
them used a different flavor of sync

746
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,119
domains and so far as a result of this

747
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,760
intervention like we have prevented 30

748
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,400
000 domains I think as of last year

749
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,680
um from being like prevented from being

750
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,740
hijackable and also

751
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,099
um the the registrars used

752
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,560
uh different sort of renaming idioms and

753
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,520
like more interestingly GoDaddy used

754
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,839
as112.arpa which was

755
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,320
um a topic of big debate uh in DNS

756
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,760
obvious today so I thought that was

757
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,020
interesting

758
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,960
um and the enum and internet.bs like

759
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,880
used a regular old domains

760
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,760
the second form of remediation was to

761
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
how do we go about fixing the currently

762
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,900
hijacked domains domains that were

763
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,240
pointing to name servers where attackers

764
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
had actually

765
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,500
um taken over the name servers so in

766
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,599
this case we created per register a list

767
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,520
of affected domains we made them

768
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,920
available to the registrar community and

769
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,780
there were some notable remediation

770
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,820
efforts by GoDaddy and Mark monitor

771
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,740
because we saw I think they saw a lot of

772
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,480
domains that were at hijacked that had

773
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,800
quite a bit of value

774
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,820
but

775
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,740
none of these Solutions really are

776
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,540
long-term Solutions and I'd like to

777
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,579
emphasize the fact that sync domains are

778
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,920
not good long-term solution

779
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,960
um there are multiple instances as I had

780
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,940
mentioned before of sync domains being

781
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,440
Avail becoming available for

782
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,960
registration as registers sort of move

783
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,660
to newer domains and in this case a

784
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,460
single registrant gets all of the

785
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,160
domains and we have a few suggestions

786
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,480
for uh long-term Solutions in the paper

787
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,839
one of this could be one of a DOT alt

788
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,300
TLD again which has been discussed in um

789
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,440
in the DNS of a working group I think

790
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,839
Warren and Paul have been working on an

791
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,880
RFC and it's like in its draft stages

792
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,859
and the second potential solution could

793
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,260
be just you know delete uh the host

794
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,020
object without trying to rename it and

795
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,820
we are not entirely sure of what the

796
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,440
potential implications could be for that

797
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,700
so something to study

798
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,359
but the thing to note here is that each

799
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,400
of these potential long-term Solutions

800
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,859
need to be certified as a change to Epp

801
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,680
and not only does this prevent relapse

802
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,619
to Old renaming idioms but also because

803
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,720
not all Epp instances support the

804
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,700
proposed Solutions so some of this is

805
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,800
going to take rejiggering on our parts

806
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,140
and from

807
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,359
and this seems like a quite a heavy lift

808
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,119
for this specific issue like changing

809
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,220
Epp changing all of these Epp instances

810
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,380
seems like a heavy lift for this one

811
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,020
specific issue and so the way I decided

812
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,619
to approach this was to sort of zoom out

813
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:58,440
and see um and try to look at some of

814
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,619
the other problems that um that that are

815
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,859
surrounding the same issue and see if we

816
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,359
could come up with solutions that are

817
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,820
more holistic and what I'd like to do

818
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,520
now is to sort of switch gears a little

819
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,680
bit and so far I've been talking about

820
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,440
opportunistic hijacks and what I'd like

821
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,900
to do now is just briefly talk about

822
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,079
targeted hijacks where attackers have a

823
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,900
goal attackers come in and want to

824
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,320
Target a specific domain and do so and

825
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,720
if there are any lessons that we can

826
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,240
learn from there so that we when we're

827
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,180
if you're going to revisit

828
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,820
these protocols then we should do so

829
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,760
that uh do so in a way that solves both

830
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,859
of these problems

831
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,200
and a lot of you might be familiar with

832
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,440
targeted hijacks because of this

833
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,000
Department of Homeland Securities

834
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,280
emergency directive asking government

835
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,320
domains to evaluate their DNS

836
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,260
infrastructure for science of tampering

837
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,160
um in January of 2019 this uh this was

838
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,140
what Cesar published

839
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,480
around the same time there were multiple

840
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,220
security vendors such as Cisco Dallas

841
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,980
Cloud strike and FireEye which published

842
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,320
multiple reports of widespread DNS

843
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,240
hijacking activity targeting multiple

844
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,940
sectors across multiple countries

845
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,040
and

846
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,520
and the the the hijack of the French

847
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,740
Aerospace company was perhaps like the

848
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,079
the most uh the first documented

849
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,180
instance of

850
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,520
a domain hijack and what I'd like to do

851
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,820
is to sort of work through uh this 2014

852
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,240
hijack as an example of how this attack

853
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,980
typically plays out and what the

854
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,320
attacker is trying to achieve and so and

855
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,000
what could be good mitigation strategies

856
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,859
for it

857
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,140
so let's say you're a client trying to

858
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,599
log into the secure network for this

859
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,940
French Aerospace company uh essentially

860
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,980
you're trying to load up this login page

861
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,220
in order to enter your credentials and

862
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,540
to do that you need to First resolve

863
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,220
secure.net.fr which is where this domain

864
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,740
lives and in order to do that the client

865
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,619
sends off this request to the recursive

866
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:14,160
resolver and we are all familiar with

867
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,500
how this resolution process takes place

868
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,780
the recursive resolver does this dance

869
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,280
with all of the authoritative name

870
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,339
servers gets an IP address caches it and

871
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,680
sends it back to the client and then the

872
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,480
client web browser goes to this IP

873
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,079
address loads up the login page and then

874
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,300
is able to sort of enter credentials and

875
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,560
get in

876
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,380
now let's see what happened in 2014.

877
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,960
in 2014 attackers were able to

878
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,020
maliciously update DNS delegations at

879
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,000
the top level domain authoritative name

880
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,079
servers

881
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,540
and I want to make sure that you folks

882
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,280
are aware of this key difference

883
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,320
unlike

884
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,540
DNS cash poisoning or query

885
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,660
interceptions which Target the DNS query

886
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,359
protocol in this case the attackers

887
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,820
Target the registrars and the Registries

888
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,619
in order to influence the delegation at

889
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,300
the top level domain authoritative name

890
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,220
server so this is not a query protocol

891
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,040
attack this is a social engineering

892
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,619
supply chain attack if you will where

893
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,660
the attackers Target the registrar and

894
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,339
the registry in order to influence the

895
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,859
top level domain delegations and now

896
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:27,839
because the attackers actually control

897
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,880
uh control the authoritative name

898
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,260
servers

899
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,200
um they can redirect all users all users

900
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,619
trying to resolve that domain to an IP

901
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,579
address of their choice and now the web

902
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,500
web browser is going to go to this

903
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,560
malicious IP address and load a web page

904
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,839
that looks awfully similar

905
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,119
to the actual login page it is in fact

906
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,320
malicious

907
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,180
and at this point of time a lot of you

908
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,000
must be asking isn't this exactly what

909
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,400
TLS is supposed to help us with like how

910
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,339
is this new how does TLS not help us

911
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:05,040
with this and it turns out that TLS

912
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,560
would have helped had it not been for

913
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,660
this unfortunate trust dependence

914
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,619
between certificate issuance and DNS so

915
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,500
it turns out that certificate issuance

916
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,740
automated certifications uses DNS to

917
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,320
approve domain ownership and since

918
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,619
attackers actually control the DNS they

919
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,780
can obtain PLS certificates for the

920
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,460
domain

921
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,560
and keep in mind like these are

922
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,200
completely legitimate certificates

923
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,640
maliciously obtained but legitimate

924
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,640
certificates nonetheless and as a result

925
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,740
uh users can't really distinguish

926
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,619
between legitimate infrastructure and

927
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,900
attacker infrastructure

928
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,079
the only silver lining in all of this is

929
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,900
the fact that certificate transparency

930
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,200
certificate certificate transparency and

931
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,420
allows for auditing of all of the

932
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,339
certificates that were issued and sort

933
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,500
of helps us in being able to identify

934
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,480
these hijacks and place so transparency

935
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,760
plays a big role as in us being able to

936
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,740
identify these hijacks

937
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,960
okay so a quick summary of like this

938
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,420
targeted infrastructure hijacks

939
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,579
um they start by an attacker acquiring

940
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,099
ability to control DNS delegations these

941
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,900
hijacks are characterized by multiple

942
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,940
brief updates so instead of hijacking

943
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,000
for a period of a day they prefer to do

944
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,720
it

945
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,480
um a few hours over a period few hours

946
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,280
every day over a period of weeks so as

947
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,619
to not attract attention and more

948
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,359
importantly because they control the DNS

949
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,420
infrastructure they can bypass dnsic TLS

950
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,520
they can just disable it or bypass it

951
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,920
and there is this parallel attacker

952
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,200
infrastructure which is to mimic the

953
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,180
target domain and this response with a

954
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,920
maliciously obtained TLS certificate

955
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,380
which basically means like they cannot

956
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,599
be distinguished from the legitimate

957
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,220
infrastructure and once you have the

958
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,319
redirected users you can either

959
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,599
compromise them or harvest credentials

960
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,540
with the ultimate goal of infiltrating

961
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,119
the target organization

962
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,819
and so with this understanding of

963
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:12,660
targeted infrastructure hijacks

964
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,200
so I went way too far okay

965
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,800
we wanted okay now sorry I sort of

966
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,420
spoiler alert

967
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,160
um so

968
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,740
um we wanted to construct

969
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,240
yeah okay

970
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,859
um we wanted to construct a methodology

971
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:34,440
to retroactively identify these targeted

972
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,359
domain hijacks in the wild and as an

973
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,480
independent third party and I'm not

974
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,339
going to go into the details of how we

975
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,800
did it happy to talk about it the link

976
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,880
to the paper is in the slides but in all

977
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,420
we identified 41 domains as hijacked 33

978
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,220
of these domains we were able to

979
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,099
independently re-identify and verify

980
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,079
from previously published reports I

981
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,260
think we were able to independently

982
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,420
re-identify each uh nearly all of the

983
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,160
domains that were previously published

984
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,440
and eight domains that were not

985
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,119
previously identified or at least not

986
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,760
reported and we think that these are

987
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,680
high confidence and like each of them is

988
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,960
manually evaluated there are many many

989
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,119
more domains where there is circumstance

990
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,880
circumstantial evidence but we just

991
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,220
didn't feel confident enough to consider

992
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,079
them as hijacked and this is one of the

993
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,700
limitations of being an independent

994
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,680
third party

995
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,339
so um to give you a sense of what is it

996
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,380
that like the data that we were able to

997
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,099
find so um so here is an example of four

998
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,099
uh domains that we identified a hijacked

999
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:44,760
uh all belonging to uh dot kg which is

1000
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,400
the Kyrgyzstan uh government uh three of

1001
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,260
them were government domains one of them

1002
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,839
was an infrastructure provider in

1003
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,280
Kyrgyzstan

1004
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,180
um

1005
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,339
and we find that each of them was

1006
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:57,800
targeted from the same network

1007
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,180
geolocated to Russia each of them

1008
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,940
targeting uh the mail infrastructure I

1009
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,680
just want to be careful here uh the

1010
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,160
geolocation is not to denote attribution

1011
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,380
um but in each of these cases the mail

1012
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,760
infrastructure was the one that was

1013
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,200
targeted

1014
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,960
and um for example for Ministry for

1015
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,420
foreign affairs in Kyrgyzstan

1016
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,760
um they used Zimbra as their mail

1017
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,460
provider and we find that the attackers

1018
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,020
sort of setting up this parallel

1019
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,119
infrastructure with that mimics the

1020
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,520
Zimbra my login page

1021
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,980
um and sort of uh prompt malicious

1022
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,380
downloads or harvesting uh user

1023
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,760
credentials

1024
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,640
and I don't expect any of you to read

1025
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,859
this but this is like the entire list of

1026
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,200
41 domains so if you have the slides

1027
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,060
open on your computer you can sort of go

1028
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,240
over the slides and the only thing that

1029
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,640
I can that you might be able to see is

1030
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,740
some of the patterns that sort of emerge

1031
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,839
a lot of government domains a lot of

1032
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,619
male infrastructure a lot of reuse

1033
00:46:58,619 --> 00:46:59,220
um

1034
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,260
in the same attacker infrastructure

1035
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,119
which was surprising

1036
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,160
um but roughly speaking

1037
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,859
um this is a this is an ongoing issue

1038
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,599
and something that's actually been

1039
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,300
becoming more problematic uh over the

1040
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,400
over time

1041
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,480
so

1042
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,240
um if I were to summarize this uh Target

1043
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,940
hijacks part I would say like the thing

1044
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,579
that we as a community need to sort of

1045
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,800
grapple with is the fact that the

1046
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,599
traditional mechanisms such as DNS Tech

1047
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,119
and TLS don't really protect against

1048
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,220
these DNS infrastructure hijacks since

1049
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,280
attackers are able to sort of go and

1050
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,560
disable these protections and that there

1051
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,660
is a need for more transparency and

1052
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,060
proactive measurements to understand how

1053
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,380
to mitigate these future attacks and

1054
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,740
um I thought now that we understood what

1055
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,380
the the big bigger issues were and

1056
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,839
Christmas is near I should come up with

1057
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,400
a wish list

1058
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,680
um and I'm told that the ITF Center only

1059
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,319
deals with rfcs so I thought

1060
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,839
um how about I come up with what I would

1061
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,500
like to see so there were three things

1062
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,500
um and the DNS transparency I've

1063
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,359
realized after talking to a lot of

1064
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,760
people is an overloaded term and I think

1065
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,619
it should be I should have renamed it to

1066
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,560
Epp transparency since it sort of builds

1067
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,359
up on some of the Epp changes that we're

1068
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,440
thinking of

1069
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,319
but I'm not going to belabor the Epp

1070
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,359
point it is to essentially codify

1071
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,500
changes

1072
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,359
um so that we don't create new

1073
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:33,240
sacrificial name servers the added thing

1074
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,280
that we can sort of think there is can

1075
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,119
we sort of think about mechanisms to

1076
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,560
have consistency across top-level

1077
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,000
domains

1078
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,240
but sort of building up on top of it so

1079
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,460
DNS transparency but specifically Epp

1080
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,560
transparency to make sure that all of

1081
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,880
the changes that are made to name

1082
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,000
servers get published so as to make sure

1083
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,400
that organizations know what their name

1084
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,500
servers look like at any given point of

1085
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,760
time so if you sort of think about does

1086
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,560
ietf.org know what the name servers for

1087
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,900
their domain are we would like to think

1088
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,940
that they haven't changed but unless you

1089
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,839
go and actually check the dot org top

1090
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,640
level domain authoritative name servers

1091
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,480
there is no way to know for sure and

1092
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,240
um and and essentially this sort of

1093
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,240
transparency is a way to get

1094
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,220
um visibility into any changes that are

1095
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,960
being made in the duration that you're

1096
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,220
not checking

1097
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,140
and I think the best analogy that I've

1098
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,240
come up with is that this is to think of

1099
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,119
this as a supply chain attack and

1100
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,880
um and having this transparency allows

1101
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,680
organizations to convince themselves

1102
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,040
that nothing really has changed assuming

1103
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,720
of course that you trust the registry

1104
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,420
but assuming that you do

1105
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,460
um I think this sort of transparency is

1106
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,619
important for organizations to convince

1107
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,240
themselves and

1108
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,520
um what we can Envision is something

1109
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,940
like an append Only log with all of the

1110
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,760
changes to name servers being recorded

1111
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,500
and finally

1112
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,839
um this is a certificate transparency on

1113
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,880
steroids certificate transparency has

1114
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,819
been great uh to identify Bad actors and

1115
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:13,500
a lot of work would wouldn't have been

1116
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,119
possible without a certificate

1117
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,680
transparency

1118
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,660
um and it turns out that certificate

1119
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,819
authorities do a lot of work when they

1120
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,280
issue certificates and if they made it

1121
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,680
sort of public or at least available to

1122
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,440
researchers such as DNS queries and the

1123
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,900
IP which initiated the risk requests we

1124
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,000
would be able to get a better sense of

1125
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,240
like what exactly might be happening

1126
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,800
and with that

1127
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,260
um I just want to say before I uh we'll

1128
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,579
go for questions I just want to thank

1129
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:43,619
all of my collaborators who are the only

1130
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:45,300
reason why I'm here

1131
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,119
um and that I think I'm happy to take

1132
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,720
questions and

1133
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,160
okay uh thank you guys some excellent

1134
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,339
[Applause]

1135
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:02,460
so uh if if there are questions please

1136
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,819
do join the queue using mitaku and come

1137
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,220
to the microphone uh while we're waiting

1138
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,099
for people to join the queue uh I'd like

1139
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:12,960
though to remind people of the masking

1140
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,880
policy for the room

1141
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,339
um if you're not an active speaker at

1142
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,380
the front here uh you need the community

1143
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,300
guidelines is that you need to wear a

1144
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,520
mask at all times and The Mask needs to

1145
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,920
cover your nose and your mouth

1146
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,720
and if you're not willing to do that

1147
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,359
then please leave the room

1148
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:31,859
all right so the

1149
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,800
if see we have some people in the queue

1150
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,359
first up in the queue is uh Dwayne

1151
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,520
how do I work

1152
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,960
brain if you can answer your question

1153
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,760
ask your question you're in the room

1154
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,000
okay

1155
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,540
hey guys I'm great talk uh

1156
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,520
um but I I really want to push back

1157
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,480
strongly on the alt TLD idea

1158
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,500
um because that is really designed for

1159
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,319
non-dns use cases and this would be very

1160
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:10,079
much a DNS use case

1161
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,000
um which would you know generate lots of

1162
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,760
traffic that we really wouldn't want to

1163
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,980
have to see so

1164
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,500
um right so my understanding of dot alt

1165
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,660
was that the recursive resolvers would

1166
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,059
drop it and in in a way this would be

1167
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,000
like a graveyard like this is where you

1168
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,619
would send domains that you don't want

1169
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,240
result

1170
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,920
um and in a way you don't want these

1171
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,780
domains to be resolved

1172
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,900
um and but yeah

1173
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,240
but again I think that's the ideal but

1174
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,780
the the draft at this point which is

1175
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,400
still a draft obviously but doesn't say

1176
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,800
that resolvers have to have to drop it

1177
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,300
so

1178
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,099
um okay I think it's I think it's at

1179
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:52,440
this point it's not a good fit

1180
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,540
um okay there should be other other

1181
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,940
ideas I guess yeah

1182
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,040
I'm happy to like again

1183
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,140
um I'm excited that people are

1184
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,760
interested in actually making these

1185
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,400
updates so like I'm happy to talk more

1186
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,800
um on like what exact solution like

1187
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,540
there are a few more solutions that

1188
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,520
we're thought through but again like

1189
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,020
it's it's always

1190
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,819
great pickup to ITF and actually

1191
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,559
understand the Practical concentrations

1192
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,780
of it so yeah happy to chat okay thanks

1193
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,059
uh Richard Wilhelm PIR uh

1194
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:29,880
um one great talk thank you uh

1195
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,220
um a couple couple things um one uh just

1196
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,140
plus one Dwayne's comment on the on the

1197
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,359
dot all thing there's not really any

1198
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,640
musts in that in that draft right now

1199
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,200
and I think that your the idea in the

1200
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,880
paper about dot invalid was probably I

1201
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,040
like going better for what it's worth

1202
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,140
um uh a couple things

1203
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,319
um you in the in the in a slides that

1204
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:50,819
had an example about the multiple

1205
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:52,740
providers and platform communication

1206
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,920
between garage even at a single registry

1207
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,500
service provider often platforms aren't

1208
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,920
often connected so whether it be at

1209
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,619
verisign or Affiliates or whatever the

1210
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,300
the platforms don't necessarily connect

1211
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,400
so it's just a yes and to the point that

1212
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,380
you were making about platforms not

1213
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,119
having communication so great point

1214
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,520
there just something else for that

1215
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,579
um it may be a solution it might be just

1216
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,440
dropping the name server

1217
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,500
um originally Epp had a requirement of

1218
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,900
having two names for servers for DNS

1219
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,180
reliability as you know that was written

1220
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,400
before the days of widespread anycast

1221
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,099
adoption so one might argue that that's

1222
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,599
outdated

1223
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,300
um but even so there's Corner cases

1224
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,940
where you could end up having that uh

1225
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,700
meaning a name name going dark

1226
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,619
um the idea of communicating all domain

1227
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,380
deletions gets very challenging because

1228
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,240
the notion of when a domain gets deleted

1229
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,059
is remarkably fuzzy at registry

1230
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,200
platforms

1231
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,819
um then the last point I'd like to make

1232
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,760
is just probably for ever more for

1233
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,059
everyone with an earshot is as you point

1234
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,280
out very well in your slides especially

1235
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,619
the Integrity of the registrants

1236
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:09,900
registrar account is so key to the

1237
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,579
underlying infrastructure as you point

1238
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,680
out in your example there and so if

1239
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,839
you've got registrations that are under

1240
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,000
your control or around you with your

1241
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,200
company

1242
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,180
um wow if you don't have multi-factor

1243
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,920
authentication on that account you're

1244
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,160
just just asking for it so if you're

1245
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,980
just sort of a plea to everybody that

1246
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,900
here that does a lot of infrastructure

1247
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,940
you should really work on locking down

1248
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,579
those domains as best you can thank you

1249
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:36,839
right

1250
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:40,200
um so a couple of things that um

1251
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,260
actually great points and I'm like uh

1252
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,619
thank you for uh the feedback

1253
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:47,940
um

1254
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,220
for for the multi-factor authentication

1255
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,980
I think totally I think the registrant

1256
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,900
account compromise

1257
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:55,920
um

1258
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,200
I think that's that's a big problem and

1259
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,760
multi-factor authentication definitely

1260
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,680
needs to be adopted but then there is

1261
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,960
also the issue of registrars themselves

1262
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,359
being compromised and we see like in in

1263
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,520
a lot of these cases Epp tokens

1264
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,119
themselves being sort of exfiltrated by

1265
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,579
um attackers nation state actors and

1266
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,460
that um but that said like they're just

1267
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,260
right account security is an important

1268
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,079
uh this is an important uh factor in all

1269
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,160
of this

1270
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,200
Elliot

1271
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,720
take out him great paper and great

1272
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,520
presentation

1273
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,319
um one of the things that occurs to me

1274
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,839
when I read and watch your presentation

1275
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,000
is what we're seeing is particularly the

1276
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,500
first part of your presentation is that

1277
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,440
we're seeing the Aging of the internet

1278
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,040
um and what that that raises a question

1279
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,480
in my mind about the externalities that

1280
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,000
are being introduced with within the

1281
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,579
system at a fundamental level uh you

1282
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:56,760
know between icann and the Registries

1283
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,260
um relating to

1284
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,859
uh is it really it is is it just an

1285
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:04,440
externality at this point uh that we're

1286
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,839
addressing in terms of

1287
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:09,780
when a name goes away is it simply if

1288
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,480
the reputational damage isn't there

1289
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,980
for

1290
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,200
um The Domain that's gone away right

1291
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,940
they've gone away they don't care about

1292
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,119
their reputation but the harm may may

1293
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,680
accrue to others

1294
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,020
in terms of what happens next if

1295
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,900
somebody reuses that domain

1296
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,960
um and now there are two sides of this

1297
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,660
right you mentioned there's this you

1298
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,940
know use of a domain name server right

1299
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,520
there's

1300
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,780
there there probably are some best

1301
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,819
practices that that need to be applied

1302
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:43,619
there I like the idea of dropping the

1303
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:44,819
name

1304
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:46,920
um for that purpose but rather the

1305
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,380
damage occur quit more quickly than and

1306
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,680
more transparently than say it being

1307
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,680
hidden but these other there is this

1308
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,300
other aspect I just tickled in my head

1309
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,099
as as possibly some further research for

1310
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:01,500
the iconites to to think about

1311
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,400
yeah

1312
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,079
um and I think Rick also made this point

1313
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,240
about like dropping the name server and

1314
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,940
like originally Epp did not allow it uh

1315
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,280
because of the requirement of two name

1316
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,920
surveys but in this case one could argue

1317
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,540
that the second name server is actually

1318
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,059
serving no purpose like it is a it is a

1319
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,980
dead it is a lame delegation it's not

1320
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,720
going to resolve and just having there

1321
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,819
is a waste of space and actually it

1322
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:26,640
might be better to make it more clear

1323
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,880
that this is a dead delegation so yeah

1324
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,660
good point thanks

1325
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,000
so like to Echo what my previous speaker

1326
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,599
said as one one uh the uh got all is not

1327
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,000
the solution you're looking for uh the

1328
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,980
reason also in I mean resolvers never

1329
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,540
would get asked for the name server's

1330
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,220
name they would internally resolve it so

1331
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,040
that's a different kind of close pass so

1332
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,980
I think GoDaddy did the right thing they

1333
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,720
used

1334
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,859
as112.apa which is kind of like yeah

1335
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:57,420
that's the sinkhole that we use for all

1336
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,740
things in DNS

1337
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,859
right and um so when we spoke to other

1338
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:03,020
people about

1339
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:07,520
as112.orpa the the hijack ability of

1340
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,859
as112.orpa domains was not immediately

1341
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:12,900
obvious to us like

1342
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,940
um since there is a sinkhole server that

1343
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,640
is localized does it sort of expose

1344
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,160
domains to some sort of localized

1345
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,319
um hijacking control uh we couldn't say

1346
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,160
but but yeah if you're if you're having

1347
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,980
as102 in your network I mean you control

1348
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,619
I mean DNS is unencrypted most of the of

1349
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,660
the time still so you can do that anyway

1350
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,020
right

1351
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,480
awesome

1352
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,079
thank you

1353
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,839
really so um thank you everybody uh

1354
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,640
excellent set of questions

1355
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,059
um I'd just like to uh give you a small

1356
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:59,040
token of our appreciation and thank you

1357
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,460

foreign

1360
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,118
do you have control

1361
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,400

1362
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,280
that's that's it all right

1363
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:01,380
hi good morning everyone

01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,400
here uh so the second talk today is by

1367
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,400
uh Karen calf uh Corin is a research

1368
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,799
affiliate at the minduru center for

1369
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,740
technology and democracy at the uh

1370
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,660
University of Cambridge uh where she

1371
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,240
studies internet governance cultures

1372
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,700
uh currents talking today about the

1373
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,619
technology we choose to create uh human

1374
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,579
rights advocacy in the ITF

1375
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:31,740
this paper was originally published in

1376
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,020
the Telecommunications Policy Journal in

1377
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,859
2021 it's also available uh as I think

1378
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:40,020
it's chapter seven of your PhD thesis

1379
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,299
and we link to your thesis on the

1380
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,420
website uh in an Open Access form if you

1381
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,040
want to read the details

1382
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,780
and again if you want if you find this

1383
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,280
work interesting I think you're talking

1384
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,819
in hrpc on Friday as well see there'll

1385
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:56,040
be similar topics I guess

1386
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,760
yeah good to go thanks so much

1387
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,980
um thank you so much for uh for being

1388
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,319
here this morning and for being with me

1389
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,140
it is day three of the iitf and I've

1390
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,980
already

1391
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,839
um been able to lose my voice so we're

1392
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,180
gonna try this slowly as I sip some

1393
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,619
water

1394
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:15,059
um I really appreciate the opportunity

1395
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,579
to be able to present my work today

1396
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:20,640
as Colin already mentioned uh my paper

1397
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,260
is called the technology we choose to

1398
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,140
create human rights advocacy in the iitf

1399
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,079
now I've been participating in the ietf

1400
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,799
since 2014

1401
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,200
um which in ITF terms makes me a very

1402
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,599
recent participant

1403
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:39,240
um and my work my research work has been

1404
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,099
generously funded by the Ford foundation

1405
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,799
and I want to thank Michael Brennan and

1406
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:45,780
Lori mcglinchey in particular for

1407
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,119
believing that this is important work

1408
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:51,359
now I wrote both my Master's thesis and

1409
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:55,440
my PhD about the ietf and the work that

1410
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,720
I'm presenting today is is part of that

1411
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,240
work and it really delves into the

1412
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,040
cultural aspects

1413
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,980
um of the iitf and in particular why

1414
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,099
Engineers choose to create and develop

1415
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,859
and standardize particular Technologies

1416
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:14,160
and what sometimes unspoken values Drive

1417
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,200
these choices

1418
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,339
but before I dive into my paper I want

1419
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:22,140
to draw some attention to the ongoing

1420
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,559
hunger strike of

1421
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,599
Eliza Egyptian British activist and

1422
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,339
technologist who has been imprisoned in

1423
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,520
Egypt unjustly for over nine years for

1424
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,720
his work on human rights and internet

1425
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,540
freedom he's a friend to many of us some

1426
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,460
of us in the room as well

1427
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,440
and I want to put this on the radar for

1428
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,059
you especially because we are in the UK

1429
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:44,760
and he's a dual Citizen and if you have

1430
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,319
any of your representatives or

1431
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,900
politicians going or being at cop27

1432
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,240
please reach out to them and see if they

1433
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,180
can plead the case for Allah to be freed

1434
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,980
now it might feel like a bit of a hard

1435
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,020
pivot to go

1436
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,720
um from this call to fiela to my paper

1437
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,059
presentation but I promise there's a red

1438
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,339
threat there in terms of the importance

1439
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:07,200
of considering the impact of technology

1440
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,180
on human rights

1441
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,359
foreign

1442
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,099
has four sections

1443
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,240
um I'm gonna talk a little bit about

1444
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,880
anthropology I'm an anthropologist by

1445
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,319
training

1446
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:21,240
um I'm gonna give some context for the

1447
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,460
research that I did talk a little bit

1448
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,740
about the findings in this paper and

1449
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,839
then move to conclusions but more

1450
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,000
importantly to the Q a because I'm

1451
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,079
really interested in having the

1452
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,460
conversation with the community and

1453
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,660
that's really why I'm here

1454
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,960
um as I mentioned I'm an anthropologist

1455
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,760
um I am currently a research affiliate

1456
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,680
at Cambridge some of you might also know

1457
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,640
me

1458
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,980
um in the context of my day job as the

1459
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,640
VP of research at the open technology

1460
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,020
fund I want to make clear though that

1461
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,940
I'm presenting this not in that capacity

1462
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:58,760
but as a lapsed or elapsing academic

1463
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:01,079
um and it's interesting it was really uh

1464
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,420
wonderful to hear Gautam uh talk before

1465
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,160
me because I'm going to riff a little

1466
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,079
bit on the story that he was trying to

1467
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,780
tell from 10 000 feet so the story that

1468
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,339
I want to tell is really about how

1469
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:13,859
well-meaning people have practices that

1470
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:17,598
sometimes have unintended consequences

1471
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,480
um

1472
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,059
so for those of you who've never met me

1473
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:24,059
who don't know my work you might also

1474
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:26,640
know me as the Cat's pet that's good

1475
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,980
that gets quoted a lot on iatf threads

1476
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,780
about what is and what isn't good

1477
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,520
etiquette

1478
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,980
um most recently on this ITF at IHF

1479
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,680
thread then I'm sure more of you than

1480
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,140
not don't need to be reminded of

1481
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,420
this quote in particular incidentally

1482
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,460
refers to another piece that I have

1483
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,040
written about ITF culture

1484
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,480
um called what's wrong with loud men

1485
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,480
talking loudly the iitf culture wars you

1486
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,339
can find a link to that piece on the

1487
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:55,140
slide and I'm super happy to talk about

1488
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,400
that as well

1489
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,780
um

1490
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:02,280
so

1491
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,040
one of the things that I love to do in

1492
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,260
my talks is preview a little bit of the

1493
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,460
key takeaway

1494
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,640
and the key takeaway for this talk today

1495
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,020
is somewhat of a controversial one at

1496
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,540
least in this community if there's one

1497
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,339
thing that I hope sticks with you today

1498
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:20,339
from my talk it is that the itf's work

1499
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:22,740
is political much as there is a mantra

1500
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:25,619
here that says we don't do politics

1501
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:27,780
and I want to be really clear about what

1502
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,819
I say when I mean political and politics

1503
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,799
so for me that means that the work is

1504
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:33,420
infused with historically contingent

1505
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,940
power relations and the values the

1506
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:37,319
personal values the political values

1507
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:39,599
held by its participants so I'm talking

1508
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,940
about politics in terms of values and

1509
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,339
power relationships not necessarily in

1510
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:46,020
terms of political parties just to move

1511
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,200
that clear

1512
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:51,660
um now that I've situated myself within

1513
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,099
the community I want to talk a little

1514
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:56,160
bit about why the IHF is such a

1515
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,380
fascinating place for anthropologists

1516
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,539
and I'm going to do that by taking a

1517
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:02,700
really quick dive into some important

1518
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,960
developments in the field of

1519
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,940
anthropology sort of starting since the

1520
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,640
1970s but bear with me I promise we'll

1521
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,640
get to 2022 in a second

1522
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,839
now

1523
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,539
um many people see anthropologists a

1524
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:18,539
social science researchers who go off to

1525
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,700
remote Islands to study people who are

1526
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,740
very different from us

1527
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,480
um to study sort of the Argonauts of the

1528
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,099
Western Pacific to bring in some

1529
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:27,839
classical anthropological work

1530
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:31,260
and whilst this once was largely the

1531
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,880
focus of anthropologists

1532
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,740
um a lot has changed especially since

1533
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:37,920
the 1970s when there was a switch in the

1534
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,920
field from uh from that kind of research

1535
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,220
to studying up and studying in our own

1536
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,980
societies meaning studying those more

1537
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,619
powerful than us within the context in

1538
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:53,460
which we ourselves are native

1539
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,920
so that means nowadays you will find us

1540
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,119
everywhere

1541
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,640
um we are studying the US government we

1542
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,460
are studying the European Union we are

1543
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:05,940
studying Netflix meta Apple wherever we

1544
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,500
can enter so the well-known tech

1545
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,299
companies but also lesser well-known

1546
01:08:09,299 --> 01:08:12,980
communities like the ITF

1547
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:15,359
and one of the interesting thing is

1548
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,179
um like iitf Engineers anthropologists

1549
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:19,979
of Technology get together

1550
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:22,859
and have beer and gossip and trade War

1551
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:24,020
Stories

1552
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,620
and

1553
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,359
um the interesting thing is when I do

1554
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,100
that with fellow anthropologists who are

1555
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,100
in this field and we share our war

1556
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,560
stories I often get asked how do you

1557
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,299
deal with the hostilities that many

1558
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:38,698
anthropologists experience being social

1559
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,380
scientists who study technical

1560
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,819
communities

1561
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:43,500
and one of the things that always tends

1562
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,020
to surprise my colleagues is that I say

1563
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,660
I've actually found the ITF to be very

1564
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,719
receptive of my work I'm very curious

1565
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:55,979
about it even if we don't always agree

1566
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:57,299
um I don't think I would be here

1567
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,000
receiving this price if that wasn't the

1568
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,779
case

1569
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:02,460
and I'm very appreciative of that

1570
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,839
reality

1571
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,580
and I think part of the reason why is

1572
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,080
because when the iitf started it was

1573
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,880
really a wild band of scientists from

1574
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,219
all sorts of different disciplines

1575
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:13,259
um in the time that I've spent here I've

1576
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,979
interviewed uh astronomers

1577
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:19,738
um philosophers other anthropologists

1578
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,020
people coming from a wide array of

1579
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,380
academic backgrounds

1580
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,319
um and bringing those very um

1581
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,060
interesting and diverse perspective to

1582
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,759
the work that is done here

1583
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:35,040
now this is a quick how why

1584
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,899
eventropology slide

1585
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:37,979
um for those in the room who are less

1586
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,839
familiar with it as an academic

1587
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:40,979
discipline

1588
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:42,238
um so let me give you a really quick

1589
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,759
sort of bird's eye overview what

1590
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:46,679
anthropologists do is that we study

1591
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:49,500
human behavior and cultures and we do

1592
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,060
that through direct engagement with

1593
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,299
humans so by participating in their

1594
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:56,100
worlds

1595
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,600
um so in my case I've spent three years

1596
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,400
doing field work within the IHF and by

1597
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,960
doing in-depth interviews and other

1598
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,699
types of field work

1599
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,140
um and what really

1600
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,300
that allows us to really draw out the

1601
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,000
cultural conditions that shape society

1602
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,500
and that's what I hope to make concrete

1603
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,520
in the paper that I'm going to be

1604
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,500
presenting today I really try to

1605
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,480
demonstrate how

1606
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,160
um issues like autonomy freedom and

1607
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,560
choice are valued in the ITF and how

1608
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,020
that impacts the technology that we

1609
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,000
choose to create

1610
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,400
now I'm not entirely sure how well you

1611
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,460
can read this slide

1612
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,100
um but this is a picture that I took

1613
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:36,420
during I think the 2019 I in 2019 ITF

1614
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,739
presentation in Prague

1615
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:40,500
and the slide has three columns

1616
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,320
outlining a conversation between A and B

1617
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,440
let's go with Bob and Alice uh column

1618
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,360
the First Column outlines what Ellis

1619
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,460
said in the meeting

1620
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,340
column the second column outlines what

1621
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:56,940
Bob thinks Ellis said or is trying to

1622
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:00,420
say and the third column outlines what

1623
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,760
Alice is truly saying what she truly

1624
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,940
means the same so for example in the

1625
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,580
first uh column it says that Alice told

1626
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,040
Bob I have a few comments

1627
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,340
and what Bob heard was please rewrite

1628
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,580
this draft entirely thank you but what

1629
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,340
Alice truly meant is I found some typos

1630
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,800
and what anthropologists try to do is

1631
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,560
really to get at that third column

1632
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,960
trying to understand what people truly

1633
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,239
mean and what values and politics drive

1634
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,920
those views

1635
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,000
so

1636
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,860
putting all of that information in the

1637
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,840
context of my paper on the technology

1638
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,360
that we choose to create

1639
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,760
um I have a bit of a schematic overview

1640
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,440
of the kind of questions that

1641
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,080
anthropologists ask and the kind of

1642
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,640
answers that I've given in the context

1643
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,040
of this paper and in particular my

1644
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,260
research has looked at how ITF Engineers

1645
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,719
have responded to the attempts

1646
01:11:57,719 --> 01:11:59,840
um of Human Rights activists to include

1647
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,960
human rights considerations in the itf's

1648
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,500
work

1649
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,380
so here we go so anthropologists ask

1650
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,080
questions like what do people care about

1651
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,840
what beliefs do they hold and how do

1652
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,480
these beliefs inform cultural practices

1653
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,420
for instance the cultural practice of

1654
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,640
developing protocols and standards now

1655
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,679
in this particular case I found that a

1656
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:26,820
lot of the people here care about

1657
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,460
Freedom autonomy growth of the network

1658
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,800
and having the choice and also leaving

1659
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,239
the choice that people end up

1660
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:35,400
implementing protocols

1661
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,159
some of the beliefs that they hold

1662
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,340
are that these particular things Freedom

1663
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,560
autonomy growth and choice is well what

1664
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,300
make the best functioning internet for

1665
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,380
all of us

1666
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,600
and these beliefs inform the cultural

1667
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,060
practices of standardization in this

1668
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,120
particular case by bolstering some of

1669
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,040
the resistance against the human rights

1670
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,540
work

1671
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,820
now what I show throughout the paper is

1672
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,920
that there were clashes between some of

1673
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,420
the engineers and the human rights

1674
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,659
activists as many of the engineers felt

1675
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:07,920
that the demands that the human rights

1676
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,500
activists were making were not just

1677
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,500
technically unfeasible but rather would

1678
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,420
require them to move away from some of

1679
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,100
these values that they cared about and

1680
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,400
see as key to good protocol development

1681
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,560
or to put in in other words what my

1682
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,540
paper tried to shows is that it's not

1683
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,580
just that the human rights activists

1684
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,800
were perhaps asking Engineers to do

1685
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,760
things that they thought were

1686
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,040
technically unfeasible but rather that

1687
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,080
the things that they were asking were

1688
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,500
culturally undesirable

1689
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,560
so uh that brings me to the second part

1690
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,360
of my talk where I provide a little bit

1691
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,800
more context for the research that I've

1692
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,060
been doing because I know that perhaps

1693
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,880
not everyone is equally familiar with

1694
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,780
um the human rights protocol

1695
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,699
considerations research group and other

1696
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:52,560
activities of folks who come from a

1697
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,739
public interest background in the iitf

1698
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:59,280
so here we go in uh

1699
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,500
too fast

1700
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,580
um so in October 2014 three human rights

1701
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,860
activists presented a bold idea to the

1702
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,340
ietf they wanted to do research on how

1703
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:13,800
internet standards impacted human rights

1704
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,600
initially they had wanted to directly

1705
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,080
set up a working group in the ietf but

1706
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,580
it was decided that it would perhaps be

1707
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,840
better suited to be a research group

1708
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,980
first

1709
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,500
so what the activists try to do is that

1710
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,239
they've developed guidelines that

1711
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:29,520
Engineers could use to Think Through the

1712
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,960
potential impact of the work that they

1713
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,780
were doing on a number of Human Rights

1714
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,120
and to achieve that goal the activists

1715
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,260
set up the human rights protocol

1716
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,760
considerations research group in the

1717
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,880
irtf the group is still doing a lot of

1718
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,340
work and I'll be presenting

1719
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,780
um some of my research there on Friday

1720
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,340
for people who are interested I think

1721
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,699
it's the morning slot

1722
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:52,140
so

1723
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,840
how should we see this particular group

1724
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,600
within sort of the larger history of the

1725
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,760
iitf now

1726
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,020
during its 30 plus year of existing

1727
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,140
there have always been people working

1728
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,380
alongside industry Engineers here who

1729
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,780
come from organizations that maybe don't

1730
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,719
that aren't corporations so I'm sure

1731
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,300
many of you know dkg who works for the

1732
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,520
ACLU Mallory nodal who works for the

1733
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,159
center for democracy and technology and

1734
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:24,900
they are not their presence here is not

1735
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,000
novel in any kind of way

1736
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,860
that being said the human rights

1737
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:31,199
protocol considerations group was one of

1738
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,300
the first to be so explicit about having

1739
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,040
a human rights mandate

1740
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,560
and so what happened in October 2017

1741
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,480
three years after they had initially

1742
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,640
started the work

1743
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,340
um after a lot of online and offline

1744
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,080
discussions

1745
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,640
um The Advocates published their first

1746
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,199
industrial only

1747
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,800
um RFC uh 8280 Research into human

1748
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,780
rights protocol considerations and this

1749
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,540
outlines the guidelines that they hope

1750
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,920
would encourage Engineers to Think

1751
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,199
Through the impact of their work

1752
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,480
now

1753
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,199
after the publication of this uh

1754
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,500
uh human rights guiding document

1755
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,080
there was limited uptake of it

1756
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,840
um I mean very few uh standards that

1757
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,280
I've seen at this point have human

1758
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,340
rights consideration section like they

1759
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,780
do privacy considerations or security

1760
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,659
iterations

1761
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:27,920
um and there are many many reasons why

1762
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,540
the human rights work face such an

1763
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:33,480
uphill battle now obviously some are

1764
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,580
related to sort of the political economy

1765
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,199
of standardization

1766
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,120
um the Dominus the dominance of the

1767
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,739
interests of particular technical actors

1768
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,140
and Industry actors whose main concerns

1769
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,440
are around efficiency and costs and

1770
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,520
um latency

1771
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,219
but others and this is the work that

1772
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:52,080
I've been focused on are related to the

1773
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,880
cultural conditions in the ITF and the

1774
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,679
particular values and World Views that

1775
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,199
many ITF Engineers bring to the work

1776
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:00,420
they do whether they acknowledge it or

1777
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,980
not

1778
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,000
now

1779
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,280
in my paper

1780
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,900
um I consider

1781
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,239
openness interoperability permissionless

1782
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:12,060
Innovation and connectivity as for sort

1783
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,920
of important properties or ideal

1784
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,280
outcomes that Engineers strive towards

1785
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,760
and what I do is that I outline how a

1786
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,640
distinct difference in understanding of

1787
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,460
what these desired properties mean have

1788
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,500
led to constant friction between the

1789
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,060
human rights activists and some of the

1790
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,739
engineers who are participating in this

1791
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:33,000
debate

1792
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,219
or to put it in other words as I already

1793
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:37,140
mentioned it's not just that the human

1794
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,300
rights activists ask Engineers to do

1795
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,040
things that they didn't think were

1796
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,380
technically feasible but that they asked

1797
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:45,120
them to do things that they didn't feel

1798
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,199
comfortable doing because it didn't

1799
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,699
align with their world view of what

1800
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:50,400
their role should be

1801
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,100
uh in the interest of time I will skip

1802
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,840
this one

1803
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,280
so

1804
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,159
that brings us back to

1805
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:01,080
column three remember the different

1806
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,940
columns that I outlined earlier and how

1807
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,520
I am interested as an anthropologist in

1808
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,679
understanding what people mean and how

1809
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,380
that drives their work

1810
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,300
um in doing so for this paper I found

1811
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,580
that there were big big differences

1812
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,860
between how some of the human rights

1813
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,159
people interpreted openness or interop

1814
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,980
or connectivity versus how some

1815
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,380
Engineers understood it

1816
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,480
and these are some of the examples that

1817
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,040
I outline

1818
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,620
um in the paper so for instance when

1819
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,659
talking about connectivity many of the

1820
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:35,159
engineers talk about connectivity of

1821
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:37,980
machines not necessarily of humans and

1822
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,719
connectivity in a let's say fair kind of

1823
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:41,580
manner so not too much oversight amount

1824
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,679
too much intervention permission is

1825
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,679
innovation really should not be

1826
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:49,440
centrally organized but should be done

1827
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,840
because people choose to connect to the

1828
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,900
network and openness really as freedom

1829
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,120
from coercion including sometimes from

1830
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,280
Human Rights concerns

1831
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,020
now

1832
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,719
unearthing what Engineers probably mean

1833
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:04,739
when it comes to openness and

1834
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,179
interoperability and connectivity is

1835
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:07,800
important to understand the cultural

1836
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,920
causes of friction in research groups

1837
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,960
and working groups Beyond just the ones

1838
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,780
that I've outlined here today

1839
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,000
so to make it a little bit more concrete

1840
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,320
for example when talking about

1841
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,020
permissionless Innovation many Engineers

1842
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:24,120
I interviewed talked about the ability

1843
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,300
of the individual to connect networks or

1844
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,159
innovate by building applications or

1845
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:30,840
services that run on top of the internet

1846
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,520
without permission from a central

1847
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,920
Central Authority

1848
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,300
um and they actually believe that

1849
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,040
introducing human rights considerations

1850
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,199
in the ITF could undermine that type of

1851
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:42,719
innovation as the framework for human

1852
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,120
rights is one that is sort of rooted in

1853
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,280
centralized Authority

1854
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,020
um like human rights law supported by a

1855
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,400
large number of organizations of

1856
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,960
centralized institutions like the United

1857
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,460
Nations

1858
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,080
or

1859
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,100
um

1860
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,100
as one of my interviewees said I am not

1861
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,900
convinced human rights fit within the

1862
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,300
ietf I am willing to be told otherwise

1863
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,159
but when we talk about the political

1864
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:07,620
world of Human Rights what comes to my

1865
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:09,020
mind quickly is the international

1866
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,699
telecommunications Union the Ito or

1867
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:13,320
something like that in which the

1868
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,719
question becomes Madam chairwoman I

1869
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:17,159
would like to speak about the gentleman

1870
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:19,140
from slobovia who just said something

1871
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:22,640
with which I disagree

1872
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,800
um

1873
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,960
so

1874
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,080
overall this meant that many uh who are

1875
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,540
participating in these discussions saw

1876
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,640
the human rights adverts as overly

1877
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,960
normative

1878
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,300
in a way that didn't fit with the itf's

1879
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,340
existing cultural approach to technology

1880
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,840
development

1881
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,780
and again as one of my interviewee said

1882
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,640
the problem is that the human rights

1883
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,080
protocol guidelines will be seen as

1884
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,120
didactic by the community that it is

1885
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,219
trying to influence and far from

1886
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:55,020
achieving What It Wants there is a risk

1887
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,000
that it could backfire it gives

1888
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,860
ammunition to the enemies of groups like

1889
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,820
hrbc at times

1890
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,300
so the tldr of this is a lot a lot of

1891
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,560
the struggles that happen here are

1892
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,719
because of a clash of World Views and

1893
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:12,540
those play out by way of protocols so

1894
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,760
it's politics by way of protocol

1895
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,500
something that Professor Laura de nardis

1896
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,840
has long focused her uh work on for

1897
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,520
people who are interested in reading

1898
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,659
more about this from a social science

1899
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:22,800
perspective

1900
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,100
now this Clash of World Views is not the

1901
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,900
only reason why the human rights

1902
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,520
Advocate struggled

1903
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,860
um but it is important to show how World

1904
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:36,320
Views factor in to protocol development

1905
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:37,860
[Music]

1906
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,580
um

1907
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,840
so what

1908
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,520
this is always the question so what why

1909
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,900
does any of this matter why do we need

1910
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,280
to know this

1911
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,020
um the influence of these cultural

1912
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,120
aspects of the iitf inform technical

1913
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,739
decisions

1914
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,060
um or rather that are inherent to

1915
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,100
technical decisions provide insights

1916
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:57,679
into how and when the ITF is political

1917
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,219
and

1918
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,679
this matters

1919
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,340
um because the its uh responds to some

1920
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,140
of the human rights efforts and the

1921
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:09,719
their sort of the dismissal of it to a

1922
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:12,000
certain extent in part comes from there

1923
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,080
believe that the approach of Human

1924
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,420
Rights activists would require a shift

1925
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,520
in their cultural understanding of

1926
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,440
desired protocol properties and internet

1927
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,380
architecture now many Engineers are

1928
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:25,620
hesitant to make that shift uh for fear

1929
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,360
of how it would change how the ITF

1930
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,559
operates today

1931
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,360
um or even affect the internet's overall

1932
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,520
technical functioning and the economic

1933
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,080
and cultural imperatives that undergird

1934
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:37,980
it

1935
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,480
or in other words

1936
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,920
um the protocols that are developed are

1937
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,260
about the technology that the ITF and

1938
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,480
its Engineers choose to create not just

1939
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,820
the technology that is possible

1940
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,159
and I think this matters because it

1941
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,900
truly allows us to have a deeper more

1942
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,540
honest conversation about whose values

1943
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,340
and priorities shape the work that we

1944
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,380
all do here and thereby shape internet

1945
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,140
architecture and how reflective those

1946
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,719
are of the concerns of the majority of

1947
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:05,940
individual internet users who are not

1948
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,159
present in the rooms here

1949
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,540
and that is actually where I want to

1950
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:12,060
bring my talk full circle

1951
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,820
um I started my talk about with a call

1952
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,140
to learn more about the case of La

1953
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,719
delphate in his unjust imprisonment

1954
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:21,120
because we're meeting in the UK

1955
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,980
but also because I wanted to highlight

1956
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,920
the Hostile realities that many internet

1957
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,560
Freedom activists face when calling for

1958
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,820
human rights protections from their

1959
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,020
governments

1960
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,179
similarly I could have started my talk

1961
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:36,120
by speaking about the situation in Iran

1962
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,920
um but I think that Simone basto from

1963
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,060
uni and Masa Ali mardani have already

1964
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,860
done so really well yesterday at the IAB

1965
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,780
open meeting

1966
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:48,420
um that really conveys the importance of

1967
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,280
us at least as a community thinking

1968
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,739
through the potential human rights

1969
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:55,140
ramifications of our work even if the

1970
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,580
conclusion is that we might not be able

1971
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:58,560
to remember these things

1972
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,960
so instead I will end on this note

1973
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,000
um while in part my research aims to

1974
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,820
speak to the ITF community

1975
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:08,940
um it also aims to provide a roadmap for

1976
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,140
newcomers

1977
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:11,940
especially those who are representing

1978
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,280
end users from regions that experience

1979
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,620
surveillance and repression and to help

1980
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:18,179
them understand how to be effective in

1981
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,040
this community and what cultural

1982
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,520
barriers they must overcome to do so

1983
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,100
thank you very much

1984
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:31,750
[Applause]

1985
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,560
[Music]

1986
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:37,620
thank you Karen excellent talk as always

1987
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,460
um

1988
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:42,380
does anybody have any questions

1989
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:50,400
sorry I didn't have the tool up

1990
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,120
um Rich sauce uh so I noticed you said a

1991
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,500
couple times

1992
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,739
we and that you are also a candidate for

1993
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:00,000
IAB

1994
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,340
does being part of the community affect

1995
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,580
your Independence as an anthropologist

1996
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:08,040
uh and this is a great and and beautiful

1997
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,860
question because anthropologists don't

1998
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:13,440
pertain to be independent

1999
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,900
um anthropologists as a field is

2000
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,120
inherently aware of the fact that

2001
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,040
research is always political

2002
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,460
that my World Views and how who I am

2003
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:27,420
will influence what my focus is in the

2004
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,560
research

2005
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,800
so I don't pretend to be independent or

2006
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,080
politically neutral instead what

2007
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,640
anthropologists and a number of other

2008
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,219
social scientists do is that we're very

2009
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:41,340
explicit about our positionality so what

2010
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,140
you will find in my PhD research is a

2011
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,480
positionality statement in which I for

2012
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,420
instance outline how the different ways

2013
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,980
in which I am seen

2014
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,500
impact my research a good example um

2015
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,739
that I always bring up is obviously

2016
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:59,340
um I identify as a woman

2017
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,920
and that means that I'm a minority in

2018
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,179
the ITF in some ways I'm also white that

2019
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:07,980
makes me part of a particular group

2020
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,199
within the iitf as well I am from Europe

2021
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:13,080
all of these things influence how I look

2022
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,460
at the world

2023
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,260
and that is something I'm really

2024
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,120
explicit about in my research

2025
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,020
thanks very much for your paper and your

2026
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:26,400
work

2027
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:26,940
um

2028
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:30,320
I think you chose a group

2029
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,060
at a moment in time

2030
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,440
that

2031
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,320
this community struggled with

2032
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,739
greatly quite frankly and for many

2033
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:43,739
reasons not just a single reason some of

2034
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:46,020
the reasons had to do with

2035
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:46,739
um

2036
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:48,840
the responsibilities that we in this

2037
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,920
room have

2038
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,460
not just toward

2039
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:54,360
individuals such as the one you

2040
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,520
mentioned but also towards the

2041
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,920
day-to-day person who gets

2042
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,880
ripped off from you know from fraud

2043
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,239
um we we have a a variety of

2044
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,159
responsibilities I wonder if in your

2045
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,719
paper you were able to reflect that

2046
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:11,699
because I haven't quite gone through the

2047
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:13,380
paper it's a it was a very difficult

2048
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,060
group for that and there were other

2049
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,980
issues like with some of the quality of

2050
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:19,560
the research in some cases too no I mean

2051
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,800
that

2052
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,540
that is as as I mentioned this paper is

2053
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,760
is one part out of I forget eight or

2054
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,800
nine chapters of my PhD obviously you

2055
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,360
can't fit everything into Ten Thousand

2056
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,920
Words

2057
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,100
um that being said I did Focus very

2058
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,639
specifically on a certain subset so I

2059
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,920
did focus on human rights activists in

2060
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,380
particular because I do feel that in

2061
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,760
this community

2062
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,980
um people who represent that kind of end

2063
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:49,380
user in many ways are in the minority

2064
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,600
and I feel the concerns that you raise

2065
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,000
are very valid I also feel they are well

2066
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,580
represented and not necessarily sure

2067
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,980
that it is my role to take on those

2068
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:01,800
concerns as well given that everyone has

2069
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,199
a limited amount of capacity and 24

2070
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:06,540
hours in a day

2071
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,840
foreign

2072
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,120
I'm just a little too short for the

2073
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:12,780
stand

2074
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:14,639
um my name is Michaela thank you so much

2075
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,400
for your presentation my question so

2076
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,080
coming from a human rights background so

2077
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,659
less of a technical background I am very

2078
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:22,800
interested in what you were talking

2079
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,500
about how in terms of the the

2080
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,600
differences in language in terms of how

2081
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,860
you kind of

2082
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,900
there's ways in which you can push for

2083
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,400
something as a human rights activist and

2084
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,960
that will not be interpreted always very

2085
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,580
well and so I'm curious if you have any

2086
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,620
recommendations for kind of bridging

2087
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,239
that Gap or what us as human rights

2088
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:41,460
activists can do to kind of

2089
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,800
be able to work in a more collaborative

2090
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,199
and Cooperative way with the ITF thank

2091
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:48,480
you yeah I mean there's a there's a

2092
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,800
bunch of different

2093
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,239
um recognitions that I would have maybe

2094
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:54,540
something to talk about uh offline

2095
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:57,840
um I also have more of a policy paper

2096
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,060
coming out next year that specifically

2097
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:01,920
focused on such some of the cultural

2098
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,780
hurdles

2099
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,239
um that the ITF poses in terms of its

2100
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:09,600
sometimes rough uh working practices and

2101
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,940
and who those are

2102
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,980
um easy for whom those are easier to

2103
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:17,820
navigate another thing that I've seen is

2104
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,280
very effective I mean everyone who

2105
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,840
represents different interests at the

2106
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,219
ietf

2107
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:23,820
um

2108
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:27,420
sort of collaborates in ways to support

2109
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,340
each other

2110
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:32,520
um and and there are uh groups that do

2111
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,020
the same thing for human rights

2112
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,880
activists so again let's talk about that

2113
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,260
I'm happy to make some introductions

2114
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,639
there

2115
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,679
okay so I reminded that we have remote

2116
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:42,960
people too so if you can use the the

2117
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,179
tool for the computer

2118
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,520
um we have uh there's a a b in the

2119
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,120
remote Festival

2120
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:57,440
Abdul Salam if you can go ahead

2121
01:29:58,139 --> 01:30:02,900
yes I have a question regarding uh

2122
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:08,420
uh the April April RFC

2123
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,480
my my understanding from reading the

2124
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,960
documents that I understand what a

2125
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,139
writer or the author of the mean and or

2126
01:30:19,139 --> 01:30:23,580
what they mean by uh as they they see it

2127
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:26,040
as a tradition for ief

2128
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,820
but my opinion and I would like my

2129
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,699
comment now to to know your opinion as

2130
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:36,360
your expert is in Societies or

2131
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,400
communities uh Behavior

2132
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,520
my understanding that at least the

2133
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,280
document is RFC which is in the first

2134
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:49,219
October to be notified that it's it's uh

2135
01:30:49,219 --> 01:30:52,500
let's say for some kind of purpose on

2136
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,020
the document but if you write a document

2137
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,900
and you just put the date it's the first

2138
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,960
of April that as saying it's they say

2139
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,360
it's a full date or fulling date or

2140
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,300
funny date day of fools or something

2141
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:10,260
like that but in my as an academic I

2142
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:12,000
come from an engineering academic

2143
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,540
background I feel it's documents

2144
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,940
shouldn't

2145
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:21,780
be re-notify only by the date that this

2146
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:24,239
gives some kind of indication and write

2147
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:28,080
in some words saying this is in some

2148
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,440
kind of purpose just like a title so I

2149
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,060
want to know your comment on that thank

2150
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,179
you

2151
01:31:35,219 --> 01:31:38,219
I am not 100 sure I could follow that

2152
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:39,659
because it's really hard to hear remote

2153
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:41,280
questions when you're up on the stage

2154
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,980
but I think the question was why did I

2155
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:47,100
organize to talk along certain dates for

2156
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,800
key documents or I don't have anyone

2157
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,060
else in the room could hear what the

2158
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:52,199
actual question was of course about

2159
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:54,120
could you repeat it I think the question

2160
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,820
was about April Fool's RFC and why they

2161
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,400
aren't I mean what I got is that they

2162
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,540
aren't

2163
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,820
like marked as some were distinct from

2164
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:04,860
normal rfcs and people are supposed to

2165
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:08,159
understand the job that was I I think

2166
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:09,600
that might be a question for Lars and

2167
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,139
not for me

2168
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,719
foreign

2169
01:32:18,139 --> 01:32:20,580
this was a this is a great talk and and

2170
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:24,060
uh I um in the great tradition of the

2171
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,800
ITF I did not read your paper before it

2172
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,659
comes to the microphone to comment on it

2173
01:32:27,659 --> 01:32:30,120
but that doesn't stop anybody anyway so

2174
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:33,060
I I liked the principles you identified

2175
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,800
for like much people you know believe

2176
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,199
the ITF is about the one thing that I

2177
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,880
also think is is maybe in your paper

2178
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,860
which I don't know is this multi

2179
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:43,199
stakeholderism right that at least I

2180
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,360
believe there's this this Foundation

2181
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,159
there that thought like many of us

2182
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:48,900
believe that you know things get better

2183
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,340
and their consensus is stronger when

2184
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,159
when you know we have a diversity of

2185
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:55,320
opinions and and the diversity of

2186
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,239
participants in the room and so I was in

2187
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,760
Collins chair when hrpc started and I

2188
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,260
charted it and

2189
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:03,300
um my sort of motivation at the time was

2190
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,219
sort of to challenge that belief a

2191
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:06,960
little bit right because it can't just

2192
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,239
be lip service but and I was sort of

2193
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:11,760
excited when those participants showed

2194
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,320
up because that was an angle we really

2195
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,179
haven't had before and I think it has

2196
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:17,520
made the ITF stronger and I'm wondering

2197
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,900
to come to my question if in your

2198
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,580
interviews and your experience here if

2199
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,840
you would say that

2200
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,760
we are really like believe in

2201
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,260
multi-stakeholderism and it is a

2202
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,820
foundation for the work or whether we

2203
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:29,100
pay lip service to it

2204
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:32,340
so I'm I'm really interested in the fact

2205
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,260
that you choose the term

2206
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,960
multi-stakeholderism

2207
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,239
um because I know that some of the other

2208
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,679
internet governance organizations like

2209
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:43,620
icann are much more explicit in

2210
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,719
mentioning that as a key governance

2211
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:48,360
tradition

2212
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,699
whereas when I've spoken to people at

2213
01:33:50,699 --> 01:33:53,480
the ITF they say Community Driven

2214
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:56,040
bottom-up consensus

2215
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,380
but multi-stakeholderism like that

2216
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,719
particular term is not used in the same

2217
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,780
kind of way which in and of itself is an

2218
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:06,900
interesting kind of uh finding so I I

2219
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,280
use the term because maybe I talk too

2220
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,080
much to these other groups now and it's

2221
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,000
my belief the ITF actually was the

2222
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,460
original multi-stakeholder organization

2223
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,560
before we had that word and I think

2224
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,420
that's why it's not so widely used and

2225
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:20,580
other organizations have sort of now

2226
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,560
jumped on the bandwagon let's say and

2227
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,420
are trying to portray themselves as very

2228
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,340
open I think there's an argument to be

2229
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,960
had whether they actually are quite as

2230
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,880
open as they claim to be right because

2231
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,679
it's becoming a

2232
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,560
political

2233
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,420
politically reason to to be that but I

2234
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,699
sort of wonder if sort of you know if

2235
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:40,980
the iitf I think we've always had this

2236
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:43,500
you know openness that's now called

2237
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,080
multi-stakeholderism maybe and I'm sort

2238
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,699
of I'm hoping it's really sort of a

2239
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:49,320
fundamental foundation of the work like

2240
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,000
these other things are I wonder if you

2241
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,060
have opinions the interesting thing is

2242
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,380
that

2243
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:58,080
I found that there is a conflation

2244
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,380
within the ITF between being culturally

2245
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:02,520
welcoming

2246
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,460
and procedural openness

2247
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,800
so I've had a lot of people tell me

2248
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,880
uh to quote one particular person who

2249
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:16,920
said uh any effort with an email can

2250
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,719
sign up to a mailing list

2251
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,679
that is procedural openness but then a

2252
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:24,360
lot of the folks that I've spoken to who

2253
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,540
are women who are non-binary who are

2254
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:30,300
people of color not from the EU and the

2255
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:35,100
US have said that's not openness when I

2256
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,320
experience

2257
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:40,460
um sexism when I experience

2258
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:43,020
microaggressions when people make fun of

2259
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:45,179
my accent when I speak English or

2260
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:46,800
because I'm not a native speaker or

2261
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,300
because I am a native speaker with a

2262
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,480
distinct accent

2263
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,139
so

2264
01:35:52,139 --> 01:35:55,800
openness is a really thorny

2265
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,239
um issue and one of the things that I

2266
01:35:57,239 --> 01:35:59,460
think the ITF still has a lot of ground

2267
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:02,400
to gain because yes we are open

2268
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,219
but we are also a place where you know

2269
01:36:05,219 --> 01:36:07,980
on a average meeting 10 of the

2270
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,159
participants identify as women and the

2271
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:12,780
rest are men

2272
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,260
how open are you if in practice there

2273
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,239
are all sorts of difficulties in in

2274
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,340
getting the like getting and maintaining

2275
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,520
a diverse set of participants so there

2276
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,280
is some openness along certain axes but

2277
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,320
not on others and there's real work to

2278
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,300
be done there

2279
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,460
just the point of information this is

2280
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,920
the uh independent submissions editor if

2281
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,440
you have questions about April 1st rfcs

2282
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,760
just contact me directly and I won't

2283
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,639
take up any more time in this

2284
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:43,440
all right thank you Elliott uh so we

2285
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,659
have a a we're running a little short on

2286
01:36:45,659 --> 01:36:47,219
time we have a remote question from

2287
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:49,500
Simone uh and then uh the questions in

2288
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,360
the room uh and then the queue is closed

2289
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,000
and if you can be uh uh brief with your

2290
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,800
questions and answers that would be

2291
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,179
appreciated

2292
01:36:57,179 --> 01:37:00,360
all right so I try to to be brief here

2293
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:03,300
uh hi Keith I I've seen your talk

2294
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,719
multiple times in multiple venues so my

2295
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,520
question is very quick

2296
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,900
um given that

2297
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:13,139
you've been navigating uh the structure

2298
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:15,840
in the ITF and trying to find out

2299
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:16,739
um

2300
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:19,260
try to discover basically your findings

2301
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,880
now

2302
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,699
um is there any initiative to keep

2303
01:37:23,699 --> 01:37:27,300
this work alive inside the ITF like we

2304
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,340
have a little bit of research work now

2305
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:32,000
trying to find out how the process of

2306
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,460
ifc's get

2307
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:39,780
um adopted accepted or evolved so if do

2308
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:42,300
you have any any plans or is there

2309
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,239
anybody inside ITF that she's interested

2310
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:49,080
in having your work alive or keep it

2311
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,060
alive

2312
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,500
um yeah I have three really quick

2313
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,719
answers to that is the first there's

2314
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:56,460
this uh the human rights protocol

2315
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,280
considerations group is ongoing work

2316
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,260
um there is a I think it's a side

2317
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,120
meeting tomorrow of a group of folks

2318
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,460
called rasp that want to do research on

2319
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:07,920
uh standardization

2320
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,340
um gorshabbat was over there and I run a

2321
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,179
group called the public interest

2322
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:14,699
Technology Group where we convene people

2323
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:17,159
who work on standards not just at the

2324
01:38:17,159 --> 01:38:18,780
ITF but at a bunch of different places

2325
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:21,480
from a public interest perspective

2326
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,719
and as Rich uh mentioned For Better or

2327
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,719
For Worse I am running for the IAB so if

2328
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:29,520
you think that this research that I'm

2329
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,320
doing was terrible and you think it has

2330
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,840
no place in the IB or if you think this

2331
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,400
kind of a perspective

2332
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,219
um has a place then please feel free to

2333
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:40,620
send a little note to the nomcom about

2334
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:43,820
my potential candidacy

2335
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,920
you mentioned

2336
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,620
um icon and also in this slide on the

2337
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:52,679
interview I think the itu is also

2338
01:38:52,679 --> 01:38:54,840
mentioned uh could you tell more about

2339
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,940
the similar initiatives to yours on

2340
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:59,639
other standardization borders

2341
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:03,360
if you are aware of uh there there are I

2342
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,880
mean obviously I can has a has a also a

2343
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,400
long history of people from uh a

2344
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,840
not-for-profit and a public interest

2345
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,239
perspective participating uh they are

2346
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,100
divided into stakeholder constituency

2347
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:17,159
there is a uh the ncuc which stands for

2348
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:19,040
the non-commercial

2349
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,080
users Community someone from icon is

2350
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,600
going to throw something at me right now

2351
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,580
um the itu is trickier

2352
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,380
because obviously you have to be on a

2353
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,600
national delegation to participate that

2354
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,100
being said

2355
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,260
um some of the national delegations for

2356
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,820
instance the UK and the Netherlands

2357
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,400
where I am from allow Civil Society

2358
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,440
participants to join them on the

2359
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,000
delegations and actually actually

2360
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,159
actively participate in the negotiation

2361
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:47,040
so Nielsen over who was one of the

2362
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,120
founders of the human rights protocol

2363
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,760
considerations group was at the itu

2364
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,380
Plenty potentiary a couple of weeks ago

2365
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:54,719
memesh Ansari who is the head of digital

2366
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:57,840
at Human Rights NGO Article 19 was also

2367
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,659
there so these kind of initiatives exist

2368
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:03,179
across these bodies but they run into

2369
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:05,580
different and similar barriers

2370
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:07,199
everywhere for instance the fact that

2371
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,080
Civil Society is very underfunded in

2372
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,780
comparison to other participants

2373
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:15,179
thank you

2374
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:19,280
okay again very briefly please

2375
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,500
um I I loved how you said when the IDF

2376
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,080
chooses to be political and and when not

2377
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,500
uh my question was in your interviews uh

2378
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,239
so another cultural practice is that

2379
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:32,460
people sometimes represent themselves as

2380
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,199
individuals and you know hide their

2381
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:36,300
affiliation in your research did you

2382
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,100
find that and not just on human rights

2383
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,980
but maybe you can answer that people had

2384
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:42,480
a different position when speaking to

2385
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,780
you in private where they sort of didn't

2386
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:49,400
have to you know represent a company or

2387
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,659
have an affiliation that everyone knows

2388
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:53,820
about actually uh the brief answer is

2389
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:55,620
yes and this is also why I think having

2390
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,719
anthropologists in spaces like this is

2391
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,420
so important because if you only look at

2392
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:03,239
the working group mailing lists or even

2393
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:05,940
the the recordings of it you don't get

2394
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,800
the entire picture

2395
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,520
thank you

2396
01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:13,860
um hi tail David Lawrence uh real quick

2397
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,719
I had so many different thoughts uh one

2398
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:17,219
I completely support your candidacy for

2399
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:19,380
the IB I think it is something we need I

2400
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,540
believed in multi-stakeholderism in the

2401
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,460
uh ietf for more than two and a half

2402
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,080
decades now

2403
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,300
um and Technology it shares this Duality

2404
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,400
both by being neutral in and of itself

2405
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,199
but completely greasing the skids for a

2406
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:32,639
particular political

2407
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,920
um agendas and one of the the main

2408
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,060
reason I want to get up to ask a

2409
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,159
question was how do we get additional

2410
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,780
input from the other stakeholder groups

2411
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:42,060
do we need an Outreach organization are

2412
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,040
they already aware and trying to make

2413
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:46,380
inroads here like how do we further

2414
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,960
develop the inputs

2415
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:49,560
[Music]

2416
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,460
um

2417
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:53,280
so I think I the ITF does that already

2418
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,500
pretty well there are people here for

2419
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,300
instance Mallory nodal who's obviously

2420
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,280
uh on the IAB but works for the center

2421
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,679
for democracy and technology and part of

2422
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:03,480
her role is also making sure that there

2423
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,920
are resources and information available

2424
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,600
to others who are interested in that

2425
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,820
there's a need to scale it though and

2426
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,800
there is the obvious difficulty that a

2427
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,679
lot of that what we do here takes a lot

2428
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:15,179
of technical capacity that isn't

2429
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:16,560
necessarily present in the same way

2430
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,920
within Civil Society plus the fact that

2431
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:22,500
uh there are many different challenges

2432
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,000
when it comes to technology and

2433
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,440
obviously for many people the most

2434
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,880
visible parts of the internet are the

2435
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,460
most obvious ones so a lot of Civil

2436
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:30,780
Society organizations will focus on

2437
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,880
artificial intelligence social media and

2438
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,100
the things that we see that being said I

2439
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:36,300
think there are a lot of development

2440
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,940
here that will impact uh our ability to

2441
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:41,820
sort of use the internet for for ways

2442
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:44,340
that um are important to Human Rights

2443
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:46,739
activists that we have a role to play in

2444
01:42:46,739 --> 01:42:49,500
and by we I mean both me as an academic

2445
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,000
bringing that kind of work out but also

2446
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,139
the human rights activists who are

2447
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:53,159
present here

2448
01:42:53,159 --> 01:42:55,879
thank you

2449
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:03,960

2457
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,820

um the last speaker today uh last but I

2459

2461
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,880
United We Stand collaborative detection

2462
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:56,820
and mitigation of amplification DDOS

2463
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:59,280
attacks at scale

2464
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,600
um this was originally published in the

2465
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,639
UCM conference on computer and

2466
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,920
communications security I believe last

2467
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,900
year

2468
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,420
uh Danielle is a doctoral student at the

2469
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,100
Max Planck Institute in the University

2470
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,679
of this island in Germany and he focuses

2471
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:14,820
on network measurement traffic

2472
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:16,980
classification and software-defined

2473
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:19,320
networking using novel programming

2474
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:23,340
languages and he joined uh D6 in 2019 as

2475
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,739
a researcher and developer as a uh of

2476
01:44:25,739 --> 01:44:27,420
new products and solutions for internet

2477
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:30,119
exchange points that's absolutely right

2478
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:32,699
can I have control yes I need to pass

2479
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,080
the movement well there's basically

2480
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,719
nothing to add to that what Colin said

2481
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,659
um so I do not need to introduce myself

2482
01:44:39,659 --> 01:44:41,460
I think I'm now in control of the slides

2483
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:42,960
yes it says control

2484
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,639
um uh well first of all thank you all

2485
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:45,719
very much for making all of this

2486
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:48,000
possible uh thank you for these kind of

2487
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,380
phrases you are awarding here it's

2488
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,060
amazing I did not imagine ever to

2489
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,980
received something like that so thank

2490
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,199
you all very much and also thanks to my

2491
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:56,760
co-authors without these guys something

2492
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:00,179
of that would have been possible so um I

2493
01:45:00,179 --> 01:45:02,520
think very much uh Daniel Cobb and

2494
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,320
tsblue by Christoph dietzel my fellow

2495
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,420
colleagues at dkx as well as Oliver

2496
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:08,880
hulford from the btu go to Georgios

2497
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,739
marathakis from Teo delft and my

2498
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:12,179
doctoral supervisor Anya fettman from

2499
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:14,280
the Max Planck Institute

2500
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,780
all right

2501
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,340
um so the topic is once again about DDOS

2502
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:19,260
attacks uh we're going to talk about

2503
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:21,119
um why is that still a Hot Topic uh this

2504
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,400
is Dylan not really well self problem in

2505
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,139
our internet and our today's internet

2506
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:27,719
that we have and

2507
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:29,940
um the the volumes of the attacks and

2508
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,679
the Damage that they cause is still on

2509
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:33,780
the rise so we we're seeing more and

2510
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:35,040
more reports

2511
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,080
um on uh on the web

2512
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,719
um dating to I don't know now it's 3.47

2513
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:42,719
terabit attacks to date

2514
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:44,460
um this is a volume that can take like

2515
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:46,800
also the very big players at least for

2516
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,719
their scrubbing services to an enormous

2517
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:49,860
test

2518
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:51,960
um for reference a gigabit usually is

2519
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:55,320
enough to knock off some base services I

2520
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,420
don't know like some some stores web

2521
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:00,060
services stuff like that and this also

2522
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,260
targets basically everything that is

2523
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:02,400
hosted online so more and more

2524
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,440
influencing more daily lives for example

2525
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,760
financial services and even Health

2526
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,679
sector is affected or can be affected by

2527
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:09,179
that

2528
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:12,179
so um what is what is the kind of um

2529
01:46:12,179 --> 01:46:14,400
Adidas attack we are going to dig into

2530
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,480
um there's a special kind of those

2531
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,159
attacks there are many different uh

2532
01:46:17,159 --> 01:46:18,719
different types of that we're looking at

2533
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:20,219
the amplification details attacks which

2534
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:21,900
work basically as follows

2535
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:23,520
um we've got an attacker to the left and

2536
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,800
he sends small packets to a set of

2537
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,659
exploitable devices or services online

2538
01:46:27,659 --> 01:46:30,540
uh that act as a reflector

2539
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,520
and the attacker sets a spoof Source

2540
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,900
address so that the response of the

2541
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,639
reflectors which is larger than the

2542
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:37,500
initial request so say it's an

2543
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,360
amplification can be directed to any

2544
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,880
Target basically and the target is then

2545
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,080
the service that the attacker wants to

2546
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,159
knock offline

2547
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:45,719
so usually

2548
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:47,699
what is being done to

2549
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:50,639
defend oneself from that is that these

2550
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:53,280
services that want to remain alive they

2551
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,440
deploy a local scrubbing service I

2552
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,480
depict this in this figure as this uh

2553
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,739
purple box to the right and if we assume

2554
01:47:01,739 --> 01:47:03,420
that this scrubbing service did a

2555
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:05,639
perfect job well maybe they are doing a

2556
01:47:05,639 --> 01:47:07,020
very great job but they are never

2557
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:09,560
perfect and even if they did perfect job

2558
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,360
we have lots of unwanted traffic along

2559
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:15,540
the paths we saw the these blue arrows

2560
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,400
pointing to the right to the Target they

2561
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,900
are still carrying all of that unwanted

2562
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:21,600
traffic that has no use just but to be

2563
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,580
dropped so it's basically polluting the

2564
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,080
networks in between

2565
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,179
and this is where our idea kicks in

2566
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:30,000
along the path between the reflectors

2567
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,860
and the target they are so-called

2568
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,659
internet exchange points so they are

2569
01:47:33,659 --> 01:47:35,520
distributed somewhere along the path as

2570
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,280
depicted in the figure some of the paths

2571
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:41,040
of the attack traffic are going around

2572
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,500
this ixps but along some of these past

2573
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,800
paths the isps are located and that's uh

2574
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,199
that we were measuring about the about

2575
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:51,179
the the position of the ice piece along

2576
01:47:51,179 --> 01:47:52,500
the path

2577
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,719
um and also what could be the benefit of

2578
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,760
dropping the traffic earlier than at the

2579
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:57,619
local

2580
01:47:57,619 --> 01:48:00,000
scrubbing service at the Target

2581
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,520
they have one problem to say is that

2582
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,199
they are not aware of the whole attack

2583
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:05,639
that is ongoing because they have a

2584
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:07,020
limited view of just the path of the

2585
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,280
traffic that is crossing through them

2586
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,659
and they don't have the absolute view

2587
01:48:09,659 --> 01:48:11,580
that the local scrubbing service had to

2588
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:12,900
the right

2589
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,820
so

2590
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:18,239
um we are measuring a first what is uh

2591
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:20,219
the distance between uh the reflectors

2592
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:22,800
to the ISP and then from the ixp to the

2593
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,380
Target just to quantify how much earlier

2594
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:27,480
we can drop the traffic and as I said to

2595
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:29,580
uh to come over the problem with the

2596
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:31,980
local uh limited and local visibility

2597
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,440
we're going to measure how much we could

2598
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,840
benefit if they can exchange their

2599
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,699
information in order to get a more

2600
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:40,320
sophisticated and more global view the

2601
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,820
globe most global view that they can

2602
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:44,340
ever achieve if they combine all of the

2603
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:45,540
information and lastly we're going to

2604
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,400
dig into how this kind of information

2605
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,739
exchange could be done

2606
01:48:49,739 --> 01:48:52,679
so first of all let's leverage some data

2607
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:54,659
we partnered with 11x piece across the

2608
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:56,460
globe plus well that's way too much to

2609
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:57,900
say it was in Central and South Europe

2610
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:01,440
and the North American uh countries

2611
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,460
um

2612
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,739
ranging from very different types of

2613
01:49:04,739 --> 01:49:06,239
traffic lots of different numbers of

2614
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:08,400
peers there different Peak volumes and

2615
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,780
different amount of flows we could get

2616
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:12,179
from them and the time range we were

2617
01:49:12,179 --> 01:49:15,659
looking at was a half a year in 2020.

2618
01:49:15,659 --> 01:49:17,940
uh we were filtering for UDP only

2619
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:19,560
because that is what the most common

2620
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,360
amplification Adidas attacks are using

2621
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,159
as a transport protocol and then we were

2622
01:49:23,159 --> 01:49:26,040
filtering further for prominent abusable

2623
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,199
let's say like that

2624
01:49:28,199 --> 01:49:30,060
um protocols that were derived from

2625
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,219
previous related work uh these are this

2626
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:33,420
is a list of the protocols we're looking

2627
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:35,880
at in the port number and lastly we were

2628
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,380
also filtering for prominent packet

2629
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,820
sizes that are

2630
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:41,760
most mostly transmitted when a exploit

2631
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,340
its answer is being transmitted so this

2632
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:46,619
is also for the protocols a a certain

2633
01:49:46,619 --> 01:49:49,020
thing we want to look for

2634
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,780
um next on the filter data we applied a

2635
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:53,400
detection mechanism meaning that we are

2636
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,380
looking now for flows that are targeting

2637
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:57,420
the same IP address but originate from

2638
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:59,880
at least 10 different sources that are

2639
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,100
the reflectors and the absolute volume

2640
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:04,500
measured by that are in some needs to

2641
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,900
exceed one gigabit of traffic if we

2642
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,360
detect such an event it is likely to be

2643
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,340
Adidas attack which shows our thresholds

2644
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:13,380
to be let's say rather conservative in

2645
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:14,760
order to reduce the number of false

2646
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:16,560
positives

2647
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,960
uh when we did so first look at the data

2648
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,940
we had we had half a year for data and

2649
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,739
this is what it looks like so the basic

2650
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:24,239
takeaway here is there are more than

2651
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:25,920
thousands of texts every day even though

2652
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,440
we had a very conservative filtering

2653
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,600
filtering criteria up front

2654
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,580
we had also case study we could

2655
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:34,739
correlate events that we had in our data

2656
01:50:34,739 --> 01:50:36,540
with reports that were on the on the

2657
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:38,760
news so here's for example an akimai

2658
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:41,699
report that very much correlates like

2659
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:43,199
this is exactly the attack we're very

2660
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,699
confident with that

2661
01:50:44,699 --> 01:50:46,260
um but they reported on and we saw also

2662
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,340
in our data

2663
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:49,260
another takeaway here is basically that

2664
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:50,880
we have a site at which the traffic

2665
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,280
volume exceeds well beyond 10 gigabits

2666
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:55,440
per the attack Vector so that is locally

2667
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,659
easy to detect as such because that is

2668
01:50:57,659 --> 01:50:59,400
very likely to you know unwanted traffic

2669
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,560
but for the other sites for example we

2670
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,139
have here uh ce2 Central uh European 2

2671
01:51:04,139 --> 01:51:06,540
the ixp there where the local detection

2672
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:07,980
would not be feasible but still it's

2673
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:09,659
carrying the attacks traffic that's

2674
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:11,340
basically a main motivation we have to

2675
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,980
we have here uh further you can see the

2676
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,659
complexity of the attack vectors

2677
01:51:15,659 --> 01:51:16,860
themselves so you're using a couple

2678
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:20,760
ports like 53 uh cldap and other

2679
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,199
protocols like they are very very much

2680
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:24,179
uh mixed and very different protocol

2681
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:27,360
attack vectors involved in one attack

2682
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:29,219
all right the question is how accurate

2683
01:51:29,219 --> 01:51:30,420
are we with that because we want to

2684
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:33,119
reduce the amount of false positives so

2685
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:36,179
um we we compared what we found to be an

2686
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:38,639
attack event with the benign data that

2687
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:40,080
was all the data that was not caught

2688
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,360
that was caught by a filter so this are

2689
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,980
actually the protocols so far so good

2690
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:45,719
but it was not caught by a detection

2691
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:47,820
mechanism so any of the patterns did not

2692
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,679
match with too few reflectors involved

2693
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:51,719
on the absolute volume of one gigabit

2694
01:51:51,719 --> 01:51:54,300
was not reached

2695
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,699
um so we then compared some some uh

2696
01:51:56,699 --> 01:51:58,320
statistics of the benign data or the

2697
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,820
data we classified as benign with the

2698
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:01,199
ones that were caught by the attack

2699
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,780
detection mechanism and the main

2700
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:05,940
takeaway here is that for the benign um

2701
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:08,280
traffic we see a complete different

2702
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,739
picture than for the attack

2703
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:11,580
um

2704
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:13,560
um events that we found so on the top

2705
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:17,100
left corner of that ecd uh AC ecdf we

2706
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:19,020
find that all the three lines for the

2707
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:20,639
benign data are stuck to the top left

2708
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:23,100
corner whereas the attack data League

2709
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:25,080
shows a more

2710
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:28,440
uh I would say a more diverse uh picture

2711
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:30,239
meaning that there are more sites

2712
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:31,679
involved with more different port

2713
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:33,960
combinations involved but if it's just a

2714
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,639
single site involved and it's benign

2715
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:38,659
data it's to the top left

2716
01:52:38,699 --> 01:52:41,280
um so no slides of flip next uh we fired

2717
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,780
up self-attacks and I'll get some ground

2718
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:43,980
truth so we attacked our own

2719
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:45,600
infrastructure there's an ethical

2720
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,100
consideration section on the paper on

2721
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,480
that we can definitely chat about that

2722
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,619
if you're interested in what we actually

2723
01:52:49,619 --> 01:52:52,920
did uh to derive actual attack data and

2724
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,840
compare it to what we classify as such

2725
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,300
so by that we derived lots of features

2726
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:58,800
uh here on the left you have got some

2727
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,320
exemplary ones we have 1146 features

2728
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,699
derived

2729
01:53:02,699 --> 01:53:04,619
um different statistics like the amount

2730
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:06,300
of ports the duration of the attack and

2731
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:08,820
so forth and then we did in a principal

2732
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,800
components analysis on on the features

2733
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,480
that were resulting uh to the right you

2734
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,400
can see the top three

2735
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,800
um PCS being plotted and we did

2736
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,300
clustering on that and what we see is a

2737
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,820
clear visual visual uh separation of the

2738
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,560
benign tags that's a small green bump

2739
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,880
somewhere in the middle and all the

2740
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:25,679
attacks are very well clustered and all

2741
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:27,900
of the self-attacks Fall exactly into

2742
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:31,280
what we call attacks

2743
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,179
um next we compared to packet sizes for

2744
01:53:33,179 --> 01:53:34,920
self-attacks the Buddha services that we

2745
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,060
used for that did not offer every

2746
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:37,500
protocol that we were filtering for so

2747
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,300
sometimes the blue bars are missing but

2748
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:41,400
you can see for most of these examples I

2749
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,139
give an example for cl depth that is

2750
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:45,360
part part 389 in the center of the

2751
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,860
figure we can see a very strong

2752
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:48,480
correlation between the blue and the uh

2753
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,159
and the red packet sizes that we

2754
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:51,540
observed whereas the benign data is

2755
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:53,219
basically all over the place so once

2756
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:55,020
again a clear separation of our clear

2757
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:56,520
visual separation of what we call the

2758
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,619
line and what we call attack traffic so

2759
01:53:58,619 --> 01:54:00,420
another now that we are confident with

2760
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:03,960
our data we can now measure what we

2761
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:06,060
actually want to answer uh first of all

2762
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:08,400
we dug into the distance analysis

2763
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,219
so that is seen from the route server so

2764
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:12,900
we have a flow we we consider to be an

2765
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,639
attack and seen from the route server of

2766
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,280
the ixps we were counting the Hops that

2767
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,199
it took from this IP address from the

2768
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:21,900
reflector to get to the XP and then to

2769
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:24,179
whatever IP address it is destined how

2770
01:54:24,179 --> 01:54:25,800
many hops were there from the route

2771
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,380
service view to get there

2772
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:30,119
um I know that this is assumes some kind

2773
01:54:30,119 --> 01:54:31,920
of some some caveats or some some

2774
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,300
drawbacks like

2775
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,060
um semantic routing routing but so these

2776
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:37,560
numbers need to be taken with a grain of

2777
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,540
salt nevertheless if we assume that all

2778
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:40,860
of the peers adhere to what the route

2779
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:42,300
service are saying

2780
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:44,880
um we could derive that at least for uh

2781
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,239
45 of the attack uh the the volume

2782
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:49,980
originates from a direct member of the

2783
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:51,900
ISP so the ISP said very close to the

2784
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:53,400
reflector meaning that there are very

2785
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,840
good strategic position to drop the

2786
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:56,699
traffic early

2787
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:59,280
um and also for about 70 of the attacks

2788
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,199
we found that the

2789
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,780
um the target is just two hops away

2790
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:05,639
so also meaning that we are close to the

2791
01:55:05,639 --> 01:55:07,560
Target

2792
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,600
um let's take take away that we are well

2793
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,100
connected I guess

2794
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:13,139
all right next thing um we were

2795
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:14,880
measuring the collaboration benefits so

2796
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,260
now we've got lots of data we can now

2797
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:18,239
pull it together and see what would have

2798
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:20,520
been locally seen and detected as an

2799
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,619
attack with a local threshold compared

2800
01:55:22,619 --> 01:55:24,179
to if we combine all of the data and

2801
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:26,100
then apply the same threshold and then

2802
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:28,679
look at what exp now with the global

2803
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:30,540
view of that traffic have been detected

2804
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:31,800
as an attack

2805
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,719
so first of all here's a graph that is

2806
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:35,760
the ground truth if we combine all of

2807
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,440
the data we've got for each of the isps

2808
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,820
that we have to the very left we've got

2809
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,920
all of them combined so that is the 100

2810
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,600
000 attacks that we could or events we

2811
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,760
could derive from our data uh next we've

2812
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:47,040
got all but the largest one that is ce1

2813
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,199
uh just for a comparison and then we've

2814
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:51,420
got all the individual sites which are

2815
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:54,780
actually carrying attack traffic as per

2816
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:57,300
the global detection and if we now

2817
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:00,119
compare this to local thresholds various

2818
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:03,119
local thresholds we find this picture

2819
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,219
for example you can see um The prominent

2820
01:56:05,219 --> 01:56:08,100
ones I think is ce3 where basically none

2821
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,199
of the actually with the global view

2822
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:12,060
detectable attacks are being detected

2823
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:14,760
not even by 100 megabits threshold uh

2824
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:17,040
for the very for the far right one C1

2825
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,840
because it's the largest one it sees

2826
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,699
basically as much as we see with the

2827
01:56:20,699 --> 01:56:24,000
combined data for sure but C3 and C4

2828
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,280
they basically do not detect any of the

2829
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,540
attack traffic that they are actually

2830
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:29,340
carrying as such

2831
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:32,280
so what's a collaboration benefit for uh

2832
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,980
let's say 100 megabits with the global

2833
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:36,360
threshold compared to the local one and

2834
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:38,280
this graph depicts the amount of missed

2835
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,739
traffic so now they are reordered for

2836
01:56:40,739 --> 01:56:42,659
the ones to the left that missed the

2837
01:56:42,659 --> 01:56:43,560
most

2838
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:46,020
um if I compare this to

2839
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:48,239
uh to the to the globally detectable

2840
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,280
traffic we find that for some sites we

2841
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:52,080
see that 80 of the traffic is locally

2842
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,060
undetectable for this certain threshold

2843
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:56,280
and then if we apply other thresholds we

2844
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,560
even find a worse picture for sc3 in

2845
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,179
this example for a gigabit of one uh

2846
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:01,860
threshold of one gigabit we find that up

2847
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:03,900
to 90 of the attacks that were actually

2848
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:05,880
carried out by the ISP would have not

2849
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,739
been detected as such locally with a

2850
01:57:07,739 --> 01:57:09,840
local threshold

2851
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:10,980
next

2852
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,420
um in order to exchange all the

2853
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:14,280
information we are proposing an exchange

2854
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:16,380
platform on that

2855
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:18,239
um this is the overall picture let's go

2856
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:19,560
through this slowly start with the top

2857
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,780
part which is basically what it matters

2858
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:23,940
or a similar Endeavors are doing uh to

2859
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:25,619
date there is a government's body on top

2860
01:57:25,619 --> 01:57:27,060
because we do not believe that things

2861
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:29,699
like trust models or stuff uh or things

2862
01:57:29,699 --> 01:57:31,739
like that can be carried out by machines

2863
01:57:31,739 --> 01:57:33,360
only so this needs manual or human

2864
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,099
involvement

2865
01:57:35,099 --> 01:57:36,179
um so that's why we propose this

2866
01:57:36,179 --> 01:57:37,619
government buddy that lives on top of it

2867
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:40,440
and they Define filters and thresholds

2868
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,179
um they are more or less building a

2869
01:57:42,179 --> 01:57:44,159
community just likewise to the ixps

2870
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:46,080
community because you know more more

2871
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,000
peers accumulate an ISP the more

2872
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,260
community grows and more attractive

2873
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:52,139
becomes for other peers same as uh same

2874
01:57:52,139 --> 01:57:54,960
economy systems envisioned here's the

2875
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,360
more people are involving in the uh do

2876
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,980
this information exchange point the dxp

2877
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:00,900
the more value or more attractive it

2878
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:03,960
might become to others to join

2879
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,940
um we believe that there there's a need

2880
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,739
for um contracts in order to get off

2881
01:58:07,739 --> 01:58:09,900
this running smoothly so uh the

2882
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:11,880
government's body handles slas and also

2883
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:14,099
processes of use cases

2884
01:58:14,099 --> 01:58:16,320
uh for the center part we have two dxp

2885
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,760
members to the left and to the right in

2886
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,500
the center we've got the information

2887
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,719
exchange point for itself and what they

2888
01:58:21,719 --> 01:58:23,520
basically do is when they choose to

2889
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,040
collaborate with the with the dxp so

2890
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,719
they become a member of it

2891
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:29,340
um then they adhere to the government's

2892
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:31,800
rules that were defined uh before

2893
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,719
um and then exchange the information

2894
01:58:33,719 --> 01:58:35,219
about ongoing attacks that they can

2895
01:58:35,219 --> 01:58:37,020
locally see and then they publish it to

2896
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:39,599
a pub stream uh buffer which is the

2897
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:42,119
actual database of this dxp where there

2898
01:58:42,119 --> 01:58:44,040
can also fetch information about ongoing

2899
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,560
attacks from there and then if they are

2900
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,800
willing to do so apply local filtering

2901
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,420
um we envisioned two different scenarios

2902
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:53,820
for that so we um envisioned a low trust

2903
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:55,560
scenario where the peers or the members

2904
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:57,719
of the dxpd site to just share

2905
01:58:57,719 --> 01:59:00,119
information about the reflectors IP uh

2906
01:59:00,119 --> 01:59:02,219
because there are some I would say

2907
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:04,619
semi-sensitive information lists on the

2908
01:59:04,619 --> 01:59:06,179
web where you can look for reflectors

2909
01:59:06,179 --> 01:59:08,340
that have been successfully scanned by

2910
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:11,219
some guy and so the sharing of the

2911
01:59:11,219 --> 01:59:13,320
reflectors IP address is considered not

2912
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,179
too sensitive to whatever the extent

2913
01:59:15,179 --> 01:59:16,340
that might be

2914
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:18,540
and the second scenario is the high

2915
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:20,040
trust scenario where the peers choose to

2916
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,599
exchange all of the information about

2917
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:24,360
everything that they are seeing locally

2918
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,280
that is the solution destination IP

2919
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,599
address as well as the volume and the

2920
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:29,000
attack vectors of the ongoing attack

2921
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,639
lastly we Quantified the benefit of that

2922
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:36,000
to the left you can see an evaluation of

2923
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,159
the scenario of a low trust information

2924
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:40,440
exchange and what we see is a clear

2925
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,119
benefit for all of the sites we have

2926
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:43,800
once again the red bars that show the

2927
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:45,599
ground truth data of the actual attacks

2928
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:46,860
going on and compared to what we saw

2929
01:59:46,860 --> 01:59:49,080
before now there are lots of more

2930
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:52,040
um bars otherwise the colored than red

2931
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,960
appearing meaning that they can now see

2932
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,639
more than before more of the attacks

2933
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:58,199
than before just by exchanging the

2934
01:59:58,199 --> 02:00:00,440
information

2935
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:02,280
um short hint maybe on the boosted

2936
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,020
factor to the left what does that mean

2937
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:06,719
is because the ixps only see the

2938
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:09,540
reflector IPS as I just explained they

2939
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:11,460
might not see all of the traffic because

2940
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:13,739
maybe the shared reflector IPS are not

2941
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:16,199
in not visible at alert it is local ISP

2942
02:00:16,199 --> 02:00:18,420
so we boosted what this remaining should

2943
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:20,760
be to be seen at this ixp in order to

2944
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:23,219
make ce1 that was our goal reach once

2945
02:00:23,219 --> 02:00:24,659
again for the blue bar that is one

2946
02:00:24,659 --> 02:00:26,280
gigabit threshold we initially use for

2947
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:29,280
to reach again the 100 000 attacks

2948
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,080
um that we see because we know they see

2949
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:33,000
actually that much but by boosting the

2950
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,380
traffic we needed to be very careful not

2951
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:36,780
to run into false positives and by

2952
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:38,400
manually inspecting we saw that most of

2953
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,780
the attacks but basically every of these

2954
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:41,639
attacks I think 7 out of 900 that I

2955
02:00:41,639 --> 02:00:42,840
inspected

2956
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,699
um were actually false positives and all

2957
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:46,440
of the other ones were other details

2958
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:47,940
attacks that were not caught or a very

2959
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,500
conservative filtering

2960
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:51,420
to the right the high trust scenario we

2961
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:53,040
can see is uh more or less a linear

2962
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,340
incline of of attacks that are now

2963
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:58,260
globally visible because the more iceps

2964
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,060
you add to the information exchange

2965
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:02,099
platform the more information is shared

2966
02:01:02,099 --> 02:01:03,300
and the more attacks can be detected

2967
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,460
locally

2968
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:06,659
all right

2969
02:01:06,659 --> 02:01:08,460
um so to wrap up this we found about 80

2970
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,800
about half of the attacks are located

2971
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,599
more than three locations

2972
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,340
um putting strong interest on uh

2973
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:16,560
understanding more about the geographic

2974
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,599
distribution of the Adidas attacks as

2975
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:20,159
well as the geographic distribution of

2976
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:21,480
the ice piece that are very useful along

2977
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,280
the path as a mitigation

2978
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:26,040
um Point uh next we found that 80 of the

2979
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:27,780
globally detectable attacks would have

2980
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:30,179
not been detected locally because of the

2981
02:01:30,179 --> 02:01:32,420
various ISP sizes

2982
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:35,940
and we found that about 45 of reflectors

2983
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:39,000
are just the next hop of the ixp so that

2984
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,159
once again emphasis emphasizing on the

2985
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:43,679
Strategic role or the useful role in the

2986
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:45,420
position of the ISP in along the path

2987
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:46,619
that dropped the traffic early and

2988
02:01:46,619 --> 02:01:49,020
lastly we post the dxp will show that 90

2989
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:51,420
of more attacks can be detected local to

2990
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:53,940
uh due to the collaboration of the sites

2991
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:57,239
I hope that this somehow gave you some

2992
02:01:57,239 --> 02:01:58,080
uh

2993
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:01,320
interesting uh thoughts on on uh

2994
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:02,900
collaboration and exchange informations

2995
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:06,119
uh and exchange information between isps

2996
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:08,580
in order to maybe have a chat on that

2997
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:10,139
and maybe sanitize some things I know

2998
02:02:10,139 --> 02:02:11,940
that they're here in the iitf there are

2999
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:14,940
some Endeavors ongoing on um such

3000
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:16,560
information exchange proposals or

3001
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,780
Protocols are alike I'm very happy to

3002
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:20,639
have any conversations on that and hope

3003
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:21,840
I finished more or less in time because

3004
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,280
I know all of you are hungry and no one

3005
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:25,739
gets something to eat and by that I want

3006
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:27,900
to conclude my talk thankfully and I'm

3007
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,340
now very happy to take any questions

3008
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:31,320
thank you

3009
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:34,219
foreign

3010
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:42,480
that was uh impressively on time finish

3011
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,300
um thank you I can do that

3012
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:47,699
does anybody have questions for Daniel

3013
02:02:47,699 --> 02:02:50,580
uh and I'm afraid my my machinist drops

3014
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:52,380
off the Wi-Fi again so I cannot see the

3015
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:54,659
queue very easily

3016
02:02:54,659 --> 02:02:56,699
the queue is empty on the lines anyone

3017
02:02:56,699 --> 02:02:59,659
in the room have questions

3018
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:03,420
hi Robert story uscisi have you talked

3019
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:07,080
to ixps about interest in in deploying

3020
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,199
this

3021
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,599
the EXP solution I mean what kind of

3022
02:03:12,599 --> 02:03:14,580
buy-in are you getting from them uh it's

3023
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:16,080
bad like the speakers are away from me

3024
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:18,239
so I should drop some words on the

3025
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:19,860
interest of ixps

3026
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:21,540
yeah if you talk to them about interest

3027
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:23,400
in implementing this and what kind of

3028
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,260
buy-in you're getting from them uh some

3029
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:28,440
insights all of the isps that we used in

3030
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:30,000
the collaboration were all D kicks so

3031
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,219
yes they were all interested so we just

3032
02:03:32,219 --> 02:03:35,420
talked to ourselves basically

3033
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:39,420
thank you oh that sounds nice I can hear

3034
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,920
myself

3035
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:43,380
I hope this answers your question uh

3036
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:46,260
boring but true short answer sorry yes

3037
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,000
please hi this is Karen I had a quick

3038
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,099
question uh one researcher to another

3039
02:03:50,099 --> 02:03:51,719
what's the follow-up research you're

3040
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:53,280
going to do from this

3041
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,380
um now we're looking into telescope

3042
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:58,080
um usability of uh combining or uniting

3043
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,940
ixps we so we once again talk to

3044
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:02,219
ourselves but now we've got 13 isps uh

3045
02:04:02,219 --> 02:04:04,619
upcoming work next year

3046
02:04:04,619 --> 02:04:06,599
um with the follow-up work here is maybe

3047
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:09,480
we can use um a combined data set of all

3048
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:12,119
of the isps flow data that they see in

3049
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:13,619
order to get

3050
02:04:13,619 --> 02:04:16,380
um early detection for uh scanning

3051
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:19,080
activity because we might know some

3052
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:21,780
telescope IP ranges and whether we see

3053
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:23,340
traffic that is going into a telescope

3054
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:25,080
at the isps and we are going to measure

3055
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,000
uh to what extent that makes sense to

3056
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,380
also exchange telescope information

3057
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:30,420
between the isps now this is once again

3058
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:33,540
confirmation um confirmation but

3059
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:36,420
um sensitive data that needs to be

3060
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:38,099
governed and there's need for an

3061
02:04:38,099 --> 02:04:40,320
exchange and of information on on that

3062
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,460
again

3063
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:42,900
um but the overall Endeavor is to

3064
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,639
mitigate or be prepared for Adidas

3065
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:46,920
attacks before they even arise derived

3066
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:48,900
from scanning activity that we can see

3067
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:51,239
at the isg please don't steal my ideas

3068
02:04:51,239 --> 02:04:53,159
not published yet thanks

3069
02:04:53,159 --> 02:04:57,019
it's not my idea it's George side yeah

3070
02:04:57,300 --> 02:05:00,719
hi uh so from what I understood it looks

3071
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:02,280
more like uh you're looking at

3072
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,960
volumetric attacks at this point of time

3073
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:05,940
where this kind of a thing would work so

3074
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:07,500
any thoughts on

3075
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:09,119
application layer attacks because from

3076
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:12,000
DDOS the volumetric is kind of deviate

3077
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,500
you and then the real Attack is your

3078
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,820
application layer attack where the

3079
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,440
scrubbing Center comes plays a major

3080
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:19,139
role so that's my first question can I

3081
02:05:19,139 --> 02:05:20,880
pull up come on after that because I

3082
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,020
don't like double questions I always

3083
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:24,360
forget the first one very shortly is yes

3084
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:25,860
we are looking at volumetric attacks

3085
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:27,719
that is amplification data's attacks

3086
02:05:27,719 --> 02:05:30,239
because the type of data we can get at

3087
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:33,480
the ixps like very hard sample huge

3088
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:36,659
sampling factors and usually aggregated

3089
02:05:36,659 --> 02:05:40,500
um so things like packet packet attacks

3090
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,480
or student attacks in floods or some

3091
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:44,520
case like that they are just not visible

3092
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,440
with the database that we have we are

3093
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,699
looking at volumetric attacks because

3094
02:05:47,699 --> 02:05:49,679
they are from the database that we have

3095
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,780
more or less the easily I wouldn't say

3096
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:54,840
easy but they are derivable at all other

3097
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,940
attack vectors are either invisible or

3098
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,860
our sampling methods that we have to

3099
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:00,840
apply they just do not allow for any

3100
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:02,219
specific other things like that so

3101
02:06:02,219 --> 02:06:03,780
amplification that deals attacks are

3102
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:06,300
they low hanging fruits you look at up

3103
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:07,020
front

3104
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:09,719
we might someday maybe invest more time

3105
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:12,060
in digging into other stuff or GPU other

3106
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:13,619
layers problem with other layers is we

3107
02:06:13,619 --> 02:06:15,060
do not see them at all so application

3108
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,099
layer is absolute logo there's no way to

3109
02:06:17,099 --> 02:06:19,560
get there layer 4 information is what it

3110
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:21,300
was quite a bit of a struggle to to

3111
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:23,400
achieve but we could do this now

3112
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:26,400
eventually but layer 7 is no way for us

3113
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,440
to have any information on that second

3114
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:29,760
question please and I think you kind of

3115
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:31,679
answered it because my question was more

3116
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:35,340
on uh with increasing encrypted flows

3117
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:36,840
quick adoption and all of that the

3118
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:38,280
visibility is actually going to be much

3119
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:41,520
lesser even for isps so in that context

3120
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,500
uh where do you see the DDOS attack

3121
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:46,199
detection going and any thoughts or any

3122
02:06:46,199 --> 02:06:48,540
do you have any plans on how to handle

3123
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,040
that problem like

3124
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:51,719
given that you don't have visibility at

3125
02:06:51,719 --> 02:06:54,980
this point yeah maybe yeah

3126
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:57,780
I'm not sure uh with regard to extending

3127
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:59,520
the visibility I think this is yeah

3128
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:02,099
basically not nothing I can influence I

3129
02:07:02,099 --> 02:07:04,080
think we also can't do this with our

3130
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,820
members we're just not allowed because

3131
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:08,460
of due to laws and

3132
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:10,380
I say I would use what we have so far

3133
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:12,239
and make the best of it

3134
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:14,580
um and other layers on top of that I

3135
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:16,440
don't think we will ever look into that
