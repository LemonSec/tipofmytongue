90
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,829
[Music]

91
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,039
all right I'm gonna assume Eric I'm

92

Bernie my co-chair is in Cuba scuba

99
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,620
it right now

100
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,539
so then Bernie is not here he misses

101
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,220
everybody

102
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,860
our agenda today administrative stuff

103
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,380
we're going to talk about 8415 to

104
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,780
internet standard for a little bit and

105
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,880
then we have a distribute Sr locator by

106
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,400
DHCP we have registering self-generated

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,100
IPv6 addresses and then we have a couple

108
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,440
of next steps

109
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,759
um anyone have any problem with that

110
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,400
agenda I want to change it Jen is in a

111
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,720
different meeting so I have her at the

112
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,160
end so I don't want to move that if

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,479
people want to move anything else at the

114
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,318
court we can do that

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,340
All Right Moving On

116
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,979
status

117
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,120
um we don't actually have any working

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,460
group documents at the moment

119
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,139
um I think we're going to have soon a

120
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,400
bunch after this meeting but we

121
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,539
currently don't have any so there's not

122
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,860
much for me to talk about there there

123
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,380
are three related documents right now

124
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,940
um all of which are presenting today so

125
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,860
that's good everyone's made updates and

126
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,840
they're all moving so that's good

127
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,400
um just a quick thing we put on the

128
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,680
slide is the Milestones we're aiming to

129
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,220
have oh that's a typo 3315 Bays should

130
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,280
be 84 15 days sorry

131
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,380
um we're aiming to have that done in

132
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,220
January of 2020 23.

133
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,539
um and then after we're done that we can

134
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:49,919
talk about rechargering and shutting

135
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,299
down whatever makes the most sense

136
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,180
all right let me switch slides

137
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,280
so I'm gonna talk

138
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
I guess the mic is still on I'm going to

139
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,099
talk a little bit about advancing um

140
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:07,199
DHCP V6 to an internet standard so

141
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,880
some of these are a retread but just

142
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,039
people aren't aware we're trying to

143
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,479
advance

144
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,060
um DHCP to an internet standard it's the

145
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,400
last main objective left in the DHC

146
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,900
Charter

147
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,599
um so last meeting in Philadelphia we

148
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,819
decided to take this on

149
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,620
um just a quick reminder here's all the

150
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,060
requirements for everyone to read you

151
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,379
can go read these later but these are

152
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,840
all the things we have to do as part of

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,219
the process of moving to an internet

154
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,700
standard

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,039
um independent implementation status so

156
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,320
on that slide there was a Implement you

157
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
know implementations that have to exist

158
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,979
here we have

159
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,420
um lots of

160
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,880
lots of implementations exist of DHCP B6

161
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,440
I don't think there's a problem there um

162
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,300
there's a little bit of trickiness here

163
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,360
measuring 8415 compliance versus 3315

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,339
compliance but ultimately there's a lot

165
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,019
of DHCP

166
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,580
um out in the world and it's being used

167
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,959
so that's good

168
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,420
um the proposed schedule for 84 15 Biz

169
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,360
so we just published

170
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,839
0 0 of this document we started a

171
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,000
working group last call that ends next

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,019
week

173
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:16,800
um

174
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,000
sorry

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,800
work and group adoption call thank you

176
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,959
in this book

177
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,820
um yes we're in group adoption call that

178
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,500
ends on the 18th we haven't seen much on

179
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,519
that so that's going to be one of my

180
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,899
pleas today is

181
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,820
everybody take a look at it and you know

182
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,500
I think this obviously makes sense as a

183
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,880
DHCP working group graph I think it's

184
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,380
something we should work on

185
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,760
um so I'd like to hear some noise in the

186
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,040
mailing list about that

187
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,779
um we're going to publish that republish

188
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,120
that document as a working group

189
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,800
document we actually got some feedback

190
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,720
from Bad links from Ayanna thanks for

191
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,399
their review

192
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,839
um they did some so I think we'll

193
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,820
probably stick those in the zero zero

194
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,500
one that goes to the working group so

195
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
that's good news

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
um we're hoping to put 01 out in

197
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,440
mid-December with any changes for as

198
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,820
part of the working group last call

199
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,120
working group adoption call geez

200
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,100
um review we want everything wrapped up

201
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,779
by February 8th

202
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,220
um we'll do as many updates in between

203
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,140
there and March 16th is what we're

204
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,220
aiming for yeah

205
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,720
yes 23 I have not built a time machine

206
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,080
yet

207
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,560
yes it does it's wrong

208
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,800
it's one of those days

209
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,120
yep so 20 I'll slash that through sorry

210
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
um

211
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,500
yes 2023 February so we're aiming to

212
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,720
have this all wrapped up by a March ietf

213
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,399
I think if there's anything lingering we

214
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,740
can deal with that in at the March GF

215
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,660
it's kind of our game plan

216
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,700
um one thing to note here is we're going

217
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,279
to need a Shepherd for this that is not

218
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,019
one of the two co-chairs because both of

219
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,240
the co-chairs are our authors so that's

220
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
something we'll be looking for if you're

221
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,959
interested please come talk to me about

222
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,100
that

223
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,500
I think

224
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,839
Suresh

225
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,820
so I should volunteers to Shepherd that

226
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,380
that's awesome

227
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,300
um Okay so

228
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,060
things in the 8415 Biz that we've done

229
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,399
since we last talked in Philly we

230
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,920
addressed all the erratas

231
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,260
um we removed iatas we discussed

232
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,720
removing them for 8415 when we did the

233
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,700
update from 3315 and this time they're

234
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,459
really gone we took those out

235
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,620
um we also took out the server unicast

236
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,440
option because don't find it

237
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,320
we didn't find many use cases for it

238
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,300
um that also additionally resolved one

239
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,000
of the erratas it was out for it so

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,279
that's been removed and then we added a

241
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,980
reference to

242
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,959
79.43 or the those are the four things

243
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,000
we did uh any questions about any of

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,120
that

245
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,839
so there was a couple of things we

246
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,240
wanted to get some feedback on

247
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,060
um one of them was the reduce the

248
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,100
background material sections in one one

249
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,640
and one two

250
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,019
um we talked about potentially bringing

251
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,000
those down there's a lot of extra stuff

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,560
in there that I think can get removed

253
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,060
now I don't know if anyone has any

254
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,479
opinions

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
I guess I'll go through these one at a

256
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,339
time

257
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,959
um if no one runs to the mic I'm going

258
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,519
to take these as we should probably do

259
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,320
these this is going to be my position on

260
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,120
this or

261
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,680
so is there does anyone have any strong

262
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,760
opinions about leaving the background

263
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,160
material in

264
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,800
no one's running to the mic

265
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,779
um we should remove all texts related to

266
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,300
unicast Transmissions so

267
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,399
we took out the server unicast options

268
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,740
but there's a lot of text about what to

269
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,660
do in unicast situations we could

270
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,600
potentially remove them all

271
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,820
of that text we could leave it in there

272
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,220
it's a little odd that you tip out that

273
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,560
option which almost I'm going to ask the

274
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
next question as well is should we

275
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,139
deprecate the use of the multicast

276
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,540
status code so the one thing that's here

277
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,279
that I wanted to see if anyone had any

278
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,040
opinions on was if it's an 84-15 proper

279
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,920
device it might be using multicast and a

280
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,339
new server might not respond with use so

281
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,019
I don't know we're not aware of any

282
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,459
deployment so I don't think it's a

283
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,560
problem but if somebody really wants we

284
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,180
can leave the use multicast status code

285
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,220
and all the text to unicast in case

286
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,260
there is what would become a legacy

287
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,760
device that's out there trying to use

288
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,680
unicast

289
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,240
um

290
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,700
I I you know personally I think Bernie

291
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,959
was leaning towards removing all of that

292
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,060
I I think that's okay

293
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,860
um but I don't know if anybody really

294
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,200
knows if if any use of the unicast

295
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,880
status code

296
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,800
um Tomah confirmed that KIA doesn't

297
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,540
support it at all

298
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,220
um I know that there's other servers

299
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,360
that do support it but it's not used so

300
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,220
anyone have any opinions on any of that

301
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,540
oh

302
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,980
okay

303
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,540
um I I guess what I'm taking from this

304
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,519
is we're going to go ahead and do all of

305
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,079
these changes unless we hear something

306
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,279
for one one

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,800
this is the play I was talking about

308
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,380
earlier

309
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,000
[Music]

310
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,540
um

311
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,980
please send an email if you're in

312
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,480
support of this becoming a working group

313
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,579
document please send an email if you're

314
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,220
not in support of this becoming a

315
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,180
document

316
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,040
um please say something about this uh

317
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,139
I'll I'll pack again probably after this

318
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,540
meeting but yeah ultimately we want to

319
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,100
adopt this and and so we can move

320
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,279
forward

321
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,079
yeah I mean obviously when you're

322
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,820
looking at it for the group to adopt it

323
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,380
please feel free to review or looking

324
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,120
for reviews I think that's my next slide

325
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,579
yeah my next slide what you can do to

326
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,160
help review the document when published

327
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,079
and Report any issues to the author's

328
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,459
working group

329
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,920
um anything the faster we get these

330
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,540
issues and quicker we can get these

331
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,300
things resolved so if you find anything

332
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,040
you think anything's out of place please

333
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,720
let us know

334
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,760
um I think we'll make all those changes

335
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,339
in o1 that we talked about that I just

336
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,500
talked about we'll see if anyone has any

337
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,660
issues with that and I think that's

338
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,040
everything so the main thing here is

339
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
please do the adoption call and then

340
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,240
review the document

341
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,980
any other questions about 8415

342
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,180
all right

343
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,199
I'm gonna move on

344
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,320
uh we have the SR locator

345
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,420
oops

346
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,940
I don't know if somebody's online or in

347
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,139
the room for this

348
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,720
looks like online

349
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
um guys

350
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,199
see both of you are on there I'm not

351
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,579
sure who's presenting based on the

352
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,959
request so one of you guys want to jump

353
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,860
on

354
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,839
into the queue so I can admit you

355
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,519
perfect hello

356
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,800
hi we can hear you just fine go ahead do

357
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,120
you want to do you want to run the

358
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
slides or do you want me to share them

359
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,620
sorry I didn't even think about that

360
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,899
yeah so

361
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,260
uh you will help me pay Jeff okay the

362
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,300
yep yep just tell me next and I'll

363
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,620
switch to the next slide whenever you're

364
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,360
ready

365
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,540
okay I think let's begin from this page

366
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,360
uh so

367
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,220
uh the

368
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,839
draft have been present in last ITF

369
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,320
meeting and

370
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,220
uh according to the comms we updated

371
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,620
the

372
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,600
draft

373
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,820
Johnson from

374
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,839
Channel mobile

375
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,579
so next page

376
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,920
yeah I will go through the

377
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,980
uh slides quickly because most of the

378
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,859
diamonds have been

379
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,919
revealed in last meeting so the

380
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,160
background for this draft is that the

381
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,799
operators

382
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,059
began to deploy ASAP six in major

383
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,400
Network

384
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,000
uh you know the number of CPS are very

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,480
big even more than 50 subset

386
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,940
covered the whole city with uh

387
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,919
High Mobility

388
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,840
however the normally

389
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,020
normally the CPS

390
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,600
don't deploy igp

391
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,460
so operator needs some way to this

392
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,900
distribute

393
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,020
the i76 locators dynamically to simplify

394
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,240
the configuration

395
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,080
next page

396
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,400
uh

397
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,799
the basic idea is that

398
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,820
the device

399
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,220
or the dhccp server treat the siber 6

400
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,640
locator as

401
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,120
the IPv6 prefix

402
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,240
uh then the

403
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,220
dgcp server can allocate sr6 locator as

404
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,900
the prefix

405
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,740
next page

406
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,460
here is some basic format of the i76

407
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,340
seat

408
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,380
there may be two cans of seeds

409
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,940
the original original seed format

410
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,559
defined in IFC 8986

411
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,559
uh the locator

412
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,080
like IPv6 prefix

413
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,080
the locator of the

414
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,080
comprised sr6c

415
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,780
is separated to two parts

416
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,840
located block and locate a node

417
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,700
one DHCP server allocate the locator

418
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,000
uh the structure

419
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,760
was a

420
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,039
post-original seat and a comprised the

421
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,980
seed should be covered

422
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,820
next page

423
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,260
uh

424
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,000
according to

425
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,580
the

426
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,640
comments last meeting

427
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,000
we introduced a new

428
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,860
uh identify

429
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,460
uh Association for the i76 locator

430
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,100
the structure

431
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,380
is showing in this figure

432
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,280
next page

433
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,740
uh

434
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,039
under the new IA we Define

435
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,960
the iae as RS6 locator

436
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,480
options field

437
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,020
uh which will be used to specify the

438
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,460
srv6 located

439
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,080
as a figure should the post original and

440
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,660
the comprised

441
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,500
s760 the structure are covered

442
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,400
next page

443
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,299
the uh

444
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,539
encapsulated format of the new IA

445
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,860
as you need the thicker

446
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,500
and I a Sr V6 locator option

447
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,539
may appear only

448
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,480
have IE as rb6 locator option

449
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,440
uh more than one I8 i76 locator option

450
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,039
you can papaya in a single uh I I cyber

451
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,260
six locator option

452
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,240
so it's similar to the

453
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,740
IPv6 prefix

454
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,760
X page

455
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,140
so here

456
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,539
uh

457
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,480
we will provide two application

458
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,740
scenarios

459
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,240
first is

460
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,080
what works as

461
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,240
a dgcp

462
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,900
server

463
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,000
um the behavior

464
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,380
we choose here

465
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,260
it will

466
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,120
allocate

467
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,340
locator subnet prefix

468
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,059
from the prefix poll and then generate

469
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,900
the locator sum item

470
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,080
router locally and distribute the local

471
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,059
subnet

472
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:48,960
router to other Athletics note so it's

473
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,539
very simple and next page

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,799
the

475
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,260
second scenario

476
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,419
is that the brass

477
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:04,340
works as

478
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,039
EGC pv6 release agent

479
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:14,220
so the behavior is also very simple it

480
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,179
is really DHCP

481
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:21,740
v6pd allocation messages

482
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,280
generate the locator seven item

483
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,900
routine locally

484
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,340
and distribute the locator prefix

485
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,940
routine to other rp6 node

486
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,919
so it's very simple next

487
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,580
so here we choose uh what we have

488
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,980
updated

489
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,730
compared to the origin of the revision

490
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,059
[Music]

491
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,059
uh a lot of them

492
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,100
so fortunately we Define the new IA

493
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,840
option

494
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,379
inside of

495
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:15,299
using the option in the IE prefix option

496
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,100
the second day

497
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,860
point is that we Define

498
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,740
IA i76 locator option to specify

499
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,039
a Services located

500
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,120
associated with our I as I was six

501
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,200
located

502
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,539
so

503
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:43,700
it's a uh just a

504
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,000
scene with the comments received the

505
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,159
last meeting

506
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,000
next page

507
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,299
so uh we are seeking for the comments

508
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,220
in DHCP working group

509
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,039
as well in the spring working group

510
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,260
in fact

511
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,080
we hope to apply a slot in Spring

512
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,860
working group also in this meeting

513
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,500
we have not

514
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,600
got it

515
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,580
we will

516
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,279
try to contact the chairs of the Supreme

517
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,539
working group to see if we can

518
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,240
look for some slot next time

519
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,820
so any question or comments

520
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,640
yeah um one of them is a procedural

521
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,020
question have you presented at Spring

522
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,299
about this yet

523
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,100
what is the status of the spring working

524
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,899
group with this document

525
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,919
so no uh we we have another priority in

526
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,159
Spring and uh

527
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,220
uh we send the

528
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,520
uh request to the working group of

529
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,520
chairs before the meeting but we did not

530
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,880
get a slot maybe we need some further

531
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,360
message exchange with the spring group

532
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,740
and shares

533
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,419
okay yeah I mean I think we definitely

534
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:40,740
need to do some coordination we don't we

535
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,000
don't want to make this option if the

536
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,039
spring group has no interest in

537
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,799
and making this work so I I think we

538
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,600
would need to see some interest on the

539
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,039
spring working group before we would do

540
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,919
anything more with this document

541
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,720
um another question I had about this one

542
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,900
was I didn't see what to do if the when

543
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,580
they send out the solicit if they get

544
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,679
multiple answers back from different

545
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,720
servers I don't know if you want to

546
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,580
write some text about that I know in

547
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,080
this case it's probably not normal with

548
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,559
B Razz's but it's definitely possible

549
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,240
so that might be something you want to

550
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,980
consider adding to the document is what

551
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,380
brows should do if it gets more than one

552
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,760
of these IA sr6 locators and how it can

553
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,279
choose or how it deals with that whether

554
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,799
it sends them all down or how that's

555
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,260
dealt with more than one server answers

556
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,880
it I didn't see that anywhere in the

557
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,020
document I could have been wrong but

558
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,100
that might be something for you to

559
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,600
consider

560
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,919
um as well

561
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,640
yeah I think you are corrected and we

562
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,179
should considered multiple uh

563
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,260
locator of multiple other options I

564
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,700
think we can add some text as you just

565
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,360
mentioned uh after the meeting and then

566
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,900
uh generator new Revision in the uh at

567
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,400
the same time I do think

568
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,159
the spring work group

569
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,860
is not interested in

570
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,980
this draft I think this draft day is

571
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,360
very useful for operators

572
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:25,020
we may try to send some email to uh

573
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,440
swimming working group

574
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,279
to trigger some discussion on that I

575
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,840
think this is a very interesting topic

576
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,000
for the spring guys

577
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,559
foreign

578
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,559
responsible LED for DHC

579
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,799
I fully second Tim's point we need to

580
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,559
get interest in Spring to use this

581
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,720
document before spending valuable time

582
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,580
of this working group on this so

583
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,500
it's very important to get support from

584
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,240
the spring looking group and from the

585
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,039
chair of the spring working group

586
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:13,020
sure we will uh try to trigger some

587
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,200
discussion there thank you

588
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,120
okay

589
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,159
um I think that's everything I have

590
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,980
so yeah get some I guess our feedback is

591
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,720
talk to Spring see if you can get

592
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,039
interest there and then come back to the

593
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,020
DHCP working group and we'll continue to

594
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,000
work with you on this

595
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,039
okay well thank you very much

596
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,700
thank you

597
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:45,379
hey Eric Jen's up I'm sorry for the late

598
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
foreign

599
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:53,580
one second everybody online Jen is in

600
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,100
another meeting and so we told her at

601
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,659
the end but we're running super fast

602
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,220
today so we're about 10 minutes before

603
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,720
she was supposed to go

604
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,520
so hopefully she'll come in here a

605
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,760
second

606
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,679
no you're perfect we literally just the

607
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,020
slide just appeared

608
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,020
uh

609
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,940
hello

610
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,039
uh I think I know almost everyone right

611
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,880
I'm Jen next slide please

612
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,919
so we're talking about

613
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,179
how to use dhcpv6 to record and

614
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,220
addresses which were not assigned by the

615
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,659
HTTP V6 quick recap to what Warren said

616
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,500
last time in Philadelphia so the usual

617
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,200
scenario is yeah you have slack or even

618
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,679
statically assigned addresses Jose using

619
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,580
it but some administrators prefer to use

620
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,520
dhcpv6 as a kind of

621
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,919
uh login system so they could easily

622
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,860
find out who was using what so it would

623
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,320
be nice if they might want to have all

624
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,080
the information in one place so they

625
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,539
could look it up for troubleshooting

626
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,179
forensics whatever like I want to know

627
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,820
yeah what what particular device was

628
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,100
saying in that particular traffic

629
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,860
so there was a link to the slides and

630
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,720
obviously there is a video of really

631
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,179
nice presentation by Warren so next

632
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,279
slide

633
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,100
so yeah next slide so what we've done in

634
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,600
the last few months

635
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,419
we try to address feedback received on

636
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,840
the list I do hope we address

637
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,260
most if not all of it so let's go

638
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,340
straight

639
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,240
so we clarifying how the registration

640
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,840
message supposed to be sent first of all

641
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,919
we're saying that it must be sent from

642
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,220
an address being registered that would

643
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,340
help on infrastructure which has some

644
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,000
form of layer 2 security Savvy to

645
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,279
prevent spoon so you cannot register

646
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,100
something you do not own well in IPv6

647
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,279
especially in slack own means a lot of

648
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,020
things but at least you kind of

649
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,740
responding to ND for that address

650
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,200
which also implies that you cannot

651
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
register multiple addresses in one

652
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,440
message so it's going to be a message

653
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,940
per address

654
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,559
secondly host sends that message from

655
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,960
the inter through the interface which

656
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,000
has that address so if you have multiple

657
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,539
home hosts with multiple interfaces we

658
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:43,980
need to make sure we are sending it to

659
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,860
the right place

660
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,620
and well obviously we signed and create

661
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,899
four addresses which are not provided by

662
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,960
the xcpv6 which means slack or

663
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,419
statically configured that the changes

664
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,260
next slide please

665
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,480
okay that was about sending now

666
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,840
receiving some clarification on how to

667
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,939
validate a registration message

668
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,580
I learned something I did not know there

669
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,679
is already definition for address being

670
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,320
appropriate for a link which kind of

671
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,240
means the DHCP server needs to know

672
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,640
something about topology so basically we

673
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,220
kind of the server should validate that

674
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,840
the host is supposed to have that

675
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,600
address so if you are on v1x with that

676
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,519
slash 64 you should not be sending

677
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,620
something completely ridiculous in the

678
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,539
registrator message

679
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,760
so what to do when the server receives

680
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,399
this the whole ID basically let's log it

681
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,799
let's keep it somewhere so administrator

682
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,659
could look it up later

683
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,980
so the server is supposed to log it

684
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,480
somehow

685
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,860
and draft currently says should Mark

686
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,320
addresses unavailable and do not offer

687
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,279
it

688
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,840
actually is that the question to the

689
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,000
audience

690
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,080
should we have shoot here on May because

691
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
it kind of requires additional

692
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,800
capabilities for the hcp server besides

693
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,219
just login so it's a kind of going

694
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,339
slightly more further not just let's

695
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,260
track addresses

696
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,460
next slide please

697
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,719
retransmits ah we now actually have

698
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,359
is it sub the dated slides but anyway

699
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,940
that's it uh retransmit so prop oh yeah

700
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,800
proposed approach which is currently in

701
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,540
the draft and I'll talk about another

702
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,820
option which we are discussing as well

703
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,960
so just send and packets by default

704
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,659
three with some delay between them

705
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,119
preferably jittered

706
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,760
and let administrator to change those

707
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,960
variables if they don't like it

708
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,960
so why we are not I can because there is

709
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,420
no real point of having acknowledged

710
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,580
because initially you still can't rely

711
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,460
on that right uh we deploy this on the

712
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,859
client and most likely the server would

713
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,140
not support it in the wild so you don't

714
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,940
know if the server does not support it

715
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,920
or it's just not hacking it

716
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,619
next slide please

717
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,500
so for refresh you registered it like

718
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,859
three three packets in three seconds

719
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,260
but obviously you need to kind of remind

720
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,680
the server that you are still alive

721
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,220
so again proposed solution is to send

722
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,880
the message either when one third of

723
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,359
valid lifetime in initial Pio so when

724
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,000
you create an address you go to Pio look

725
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,520
in the valid Lifetime and send the timer

726
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,640
or because by default valid lifetime is

727
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,500
like a month

728
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,960
uh let's use four hours like a Magic

729
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,300
Number Warren thinks it's a magic number

730
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,119
well as good as anything else

731
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,359
and yeah original Pio is Lifetime is

732
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,820
critical because you might get a

733
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,800
a subsequent arrays with different

734
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,420
lifetime

735
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,099
so it might you might get into

736
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,200
situations when you never sent an update

737
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,940
because it keeps changing otherwise

738
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,619
you're also like getting them in the

739
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:14,280
past

740
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,280
and refresh messages should better

741
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,140
transmitted using the same logic and

742
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,380
messages in 10 seconds next slide please

743
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,640
however

744
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,680
I like being it right here we've had a

745
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,540
lot of discussion in the lobby so there

746
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,760
is another proposal which is not in the

747
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,160
draft but Bernice I think suggested it

748
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,599
on the list yeah

749
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,380
so let's use standard DHCP

750
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,480
retransmission logic with exponential

751
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,579
back off

752
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,579
and actually if you're backing it off up

753
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,220
to one hour or four hours whatever magic

754
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,680
number we want to put here it basically

755
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,560
automatically takes care of refreshing

756
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,500
so you just start changing it faster and

757
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,300
then you slow down and then you send it

758
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,180
every hour or four hours or whatever

759
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,579
then we don't need to separate refresh

760
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,760
from initial retransmits

761
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,880
and we're also probably

762
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,260
minimize the chances of packet being

763
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,339
lost

764
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,400
so again think about it I don't know I

765
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,200
don't have strong opinions on what which

766
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,420
is better it just but remember this

767
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,060
option is not in the text yet it just

768
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,640
okay next slide please

769
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,760
yeah so this is probably the main

770
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,599
changes done since Philadelphia so as I

771
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,700
said to

772
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,560
like questions here it's about rear

773
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,780
transmit strategy also about here shall

774
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,480
we stop giving the registered address to

775
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,640
anything else and by the way another

776
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,260
idea came up the hcpv4 has

777
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,960
uh inform message so maybe this should

778
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,200
be called not registration but in form

779
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,440
and besides that the authors would like

780
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,540
the working group to consider adoption

781
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,099
if there are

782
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,420
no

783
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,660
objection strong objections sir that's

784
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,780
it questions comments yep we got some

785
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,339
people in line go ahead Eric here first

786
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,180
Eric clivia Cisco

787
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,940
yeah I have a couple of concerns with

788
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,160
this the first one released on the

789
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,240
principle

790
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,540
I I feel like if you want the HTTP to

791
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,920
know about your address

792
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,140
just has for an address and they will be

793
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,760
a lot simpler than uh

794
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,900
generating your address and then

795
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,820
registering it and you won't need to

796
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,119
have I mean yet another mechanism

797
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,520
I I see one exception to to that I would

798
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,740
be link locals but I mean you never talk

799
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,060
about link Lookers I guess you don't

800
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,820
want to register link it clearly states

801
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,760
global address valid address

802
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,440
so uh so that was kind of my first uh uh

803
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,780
concern

804
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,940
should I follow with the next one or

805
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,859
yeah

806
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,660
please

807
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,560
so I well after that assuming you really

808
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,740
want to go with that

809
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,220
at least try to make the protocol right

810
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,400
and in particular you know you you know

811
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,380
that well everyone in this room is using

812
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,180
Wi-Fi everyone in the world is using

813
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,040
Wi-Fi sending multicast over Wi-Fi is

814
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,240
extremely harmful Upstream I

815
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,440
do you have comments on this I guess

816
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,480
Upstream it should not be so bad

817
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,359
extremely

818
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,980
Upstream Upstream you're sending from a

819
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,020
client Upstream you don't get multicast

820
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,420
Downstream which probably it really

821
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,160
depends where your relay or server is

822
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,560
right so so you assume that that your

823
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,180
affiliary or your server is never going

824
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,940
to be on Wi-Fi uh

825
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,940
Wi-Fi

826
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,900
speakers

827
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,680
I know I did

828
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,480
yeah yeah I didn't see the reply yeah

829
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,640
so it looks and and in particular the

830
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,280
draft also States well that's the only

831
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,480
uh message in DHCP that's not going to

832
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,740
work with

833
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,500
request reply always you know it does

834
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,079
not require acknowledge it looks to me

835
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,820
would be a lot more efficient

836
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,380
if you just send your registration

837
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,859
and get your uh acknowledgment basically

838
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,740
or some sort of acknowledgment which by

839
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,859
the way could also tell you that the

840
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,260
DHCP server has you know you somewhere

841
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,660
it mentions that there could be a an

842
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,640
issue on the server

843
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,640
with the link not being adequate

844
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,040
there are some more cases right where

845
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,140
where the DHCP server is not going to be

846
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,300
able to register your address

847
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,119
uh first of all uh clarifying questions

848
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,540
in this case again we cannot rely on

849
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,099
acknowledgment because it's quite

850
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,140
possible that DHCP server does that

851
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,119
support that stuff right so what I'm

852
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,920
supposed to do if I'm not getting an

853
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,900
acknowledgment and how it's different

854
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,119
from not having acknowledgments at all

855
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,880
that not well if you don't get an

856
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,440
acknowledgment then you are back to

857
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,480
eventually be transmitting couple of

858
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,099
times which you are going to do anyway

859
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,260
and that's the end of the story it's not

860
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,119
worse but if you get an acknowledgment

861
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,359
then you are saving quite a bit of

862
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,598
messages

863
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,400
well with the exponential book of

864
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,920
probably not so many but yeah I guess uh

865
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,740
I don't know I don't feel strongly about

866
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,839
that yeah so we definitely can consider

867
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,880
that I don't think it's a like

868
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,240
critical here yeah and and yeah my last

869
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,500
point was

870
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,680
um if the the client is getting a

871
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,300
temporary address which is quite common

872
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,540
these days it would be nice to release

873
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,880
the address when it's done with it

874
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,400
rather than you know relying on the fact

875
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,760
that it doesn't feel fresh after a third

876
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,220
of the life cycle

877
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,780
you say release like as I did it is we

878
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,920
ah you mean when you get rid of Sandy

879
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,420
yeah when the client's done with the

880
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,260
address essentially

881
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,079
yeah

882
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,180
all set okay 10 year

883
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,560
so a couple things

884
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,740
um one I actually agree with the uh uh

885
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,940
point about acknowledgment I think

886
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,140
there's no real downside to

887
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,480
acknowledging you know it just you know

888
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,800
you get the acknowledgment you stop

889
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,500
transmitting if you don't you don't

890
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,119
um so it seems like a useful thing and

891
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,680
also it gives people an incentive to

892
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,060
actually put a server there that's going

893
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,020
to listen

894
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,820
and acknowledge

895
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,760
um I don't really care a whole lot about

896
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,579
releasing but you know it is

897
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,140
a nice little cleanup there was one

898
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,940
thing I it was a couple it was one of

899
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,960
the early slides and I can't remember

900
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,400
exactly what the point was could we go

901
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,780
back

902
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,000
um one more

903
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
uh

904
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,099
yeah

905
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,680
um

906
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,079
so I mean one way to

907
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,960
well one thing that occurs to me is a

908
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,960
way to make this a little bit more

909
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,680
um

910
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,880
so

911
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,380
actually it was I think it was a slide

912
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,480
before this sorry

913
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,520
um

914
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,579
yeah so um so this thing about sending

915
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,819
one message for Iana I mean

916
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,380
we're probably going to have like

917
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,400
especially if we're doing temporary

918
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,780
addresses we're going to have like a

919
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,660
fair amount of of churn here it might

920
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,880
actually be nice to say that that

921
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,040
um you know we send a message it's like

922
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,200
a DHCP and form style message and we ask

923
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,060
for some information about how to how to

924
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,700
communicate with the server using TCP

925
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,579
and then do that instead of doing like

926
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,440
all these multicasts I mean it's true

927
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,660
that we should probably not be sending

928
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,240
multicast to the to the Wi-Fi but it's

929
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,500
not clear that that's always going to be

930
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,940
the case particularly if you're in a

931
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,200
home network or something like that I

932
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,220
don't know what the home network is

933
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,740
going to do with a multicast so it'd be

934
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,240
kind of nice if if

935
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,780
um if there are a way to uh to make the

936
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,060
communication be unicast

937
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,440
um and it doesn't seem like it's that

938
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,839
hard a problem and then like doing this

939
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,240
suddenly just becomes a non-problem it

940
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,619
was this that kind of triggered me to

941
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:30,060
think about that I mean I don't know how

942
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,380
important this is but it just sort of

943
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,420
feels to me like it'd be better to do

944
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,420
these with unicast if you could and it

945
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,599
seems like you could I mean but just to

946
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,000
clarify unique costs instead of

947
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,440
multicast but the idea of one pay get

948
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,640
power in a is like prevents pushing yeah

949
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,079
yeah exactly so that's why I mentioned

950
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,880
TCP because if you use TCP you get the

951
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,140
three-way handshake so you know you

952
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,960
actually have a real thing there

953
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,240
okay so as I mean you still would need

954
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,420
to send one request your address because

955
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,240
otherwise I can establish a TCP session

956
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,460
using address which I have and register

957
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,500
25 different addresses which are

958
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,540
actually done correct right but but it's

959
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,339
it's pretty low-key if you're using TCP

960
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:15,780
to do these registrations one per

961
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,280
address whereas if you're if you're

962
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,099
using UDP and you're using multicast

963
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,900
then potentially depending on the

964
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,520
network it could actually be problematic

965
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,980
so it just seems like it would be lower

966
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,180
lower key

967
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,460
um and you know I think it you know

968
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,079
we're talking about inventing something

969
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,119
new here and also you know if you don't

970
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,520
get back an answer saying yes I can I

971
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,980
can accept these things then you're done

972
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,020
right you basically only have to do this

973
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,119
for one message like your message is

974
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,560
going to be high I want to be able to

975
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,020
registration can I do that and you only

976
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,300
have to do that once

977
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,220
like or that is to say there you don't

978
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,359
have to do that you don't have to

979
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,740
multiply it by the number of addresses

980
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,720
you have you're just going to do it for

981
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,160
any given interface you can only send

982
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,359
one

983
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,079
so interesting I need to think about it

984
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,900
yeah thanks yeah I'm not sure how

985
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,160
important it is it just sort of felt

986
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,960
like a thing

987
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,020
yeah

988
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,119
no no this would be Greenfield but you

989
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,160
know we're it we're adding we're adding

990
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,680
new capability anyway so it's not like I

991
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,440
mean there's a reason why DHCP does what

992
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,819
it does with

993
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,339
um with um

994
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:26,579
uh with with multicast right and the

995
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,079
reason it uses relays the way it does

996
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,460
but this is kind of a different

997
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,099
situation if we can establish the link

998
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,560
to the DHCP server then that gets us our

999
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,300
topology information we know where the

1000
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,680
client is coming from we could even send

1001
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,079
an identifier with that information and

1002
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,000
then the TCP connections could all

1003
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,740
include the same identifier so now the

1004
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,420
DHCP server knows where you're located

1005
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,359
maybe it's this case maybe just build

1006
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,579
the completely new service which like

1007
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,359
accepts registrations PCP and like yeah

1008
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,579
it doesn't have to be DHCP right you

1009
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,780
just have a client yeah

1010
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,040
well no the reason I suggest TCP is

1011
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,119
because you get the three-way handshake

1012
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,020
so you yeah

1013
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,280
yeah but you can get that you can get

1014
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,780
that on the Discover right your discover

1015
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,040
you're trying to discover the service

1016
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,900
with DHCP so you get the line ID there

1017
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,140
okay right here

1018
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,520
yeah I just want to add a quick point if

1019
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,800
if we are going to do Acts or some sort

1020
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,780
of acknowledgment from the server it

1021
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,900
could also be useful to have uh like a

1022
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,180
Boolean just business to like yes I am

1023
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,280
using this I'm locking it please keep

1024
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,780
sending this when your address changes

1025
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,240
or no I'm not using this so you don't

1026
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,880
need to do the every four hours resend

1027
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,520
or send it again when you if you don't

1028
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,339
do this you can just say quiet

1029
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,079
but if you stay quiet then you have to

1030
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,520
keep resending it because you don't know

1031
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,520
if it's been dropped or if they're not

1032
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,980
using it so you can just it can be

1033
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,740
optional not required obviously so but

1034
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,680
it could just an optional hey I

1035
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,480
acknowledge I received this but I'm not

1036
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,740
going to use it

1037
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,540
um because I have nothing to do with

1038
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,520
implementions of stuff I have a question

1039
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,280
how much complexity we are already like

1040
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,619
willing to add for this well because

1041
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:20,040
login a message is just one thing with

1042
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,920
some minimal validation versus billion

1043
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,960
causes State machine and other stuff I

1044
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,280
have again

1045
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,740
fine with either option because I don't

1046
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,440
have to do this but yeah I don't I don't

1047
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,359
feel strongly about the acknowledgment

1048
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,940
but if that's being added I think that

1049
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,680
could be an extra useful feature so

1050
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,359
thank you I guess someone taken minutes

1051
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,040
right

1052
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,839
yeah

1053
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,800
thanks

1054
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,300
tell them I just wanted to I just wanted

1055
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,940
to add something to this which is that

1056
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,540
um so if you um

1057
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,740
now it's shot out of my head uh sorry

1058
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,380
um so we're talking about uh

1059
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,859
it's

1060
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:10,380
uh right so so if the server uh if

1061
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,240
you're if you're sending the message to

1062
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,740
the server

1063
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,720
um and the server oh right yeah this was

1064
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,660
the thing um so so one of the problems

1065
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,160
that we have with with this current spec

1066
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,140
is that you could have a DHCP server on

1067
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,220
the link but it doesn't support this

1068
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,540
message and so it doesn't reply to it

1069
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,240
right on the other hand if we do the

1070
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,740
Discover thing that I suggested that

1071
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,420
could be done in a DHCP in form and now

1072
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,700
you get an act back you're always going

1073
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,079
to get an act back it might not have the

1074
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,640
information you need if it doesn't that

1075
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,619
means it's not supported info request

1076
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,980
yeah whatever DHCP before yeah the

1077
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,079
details details so so that that would

1078
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,400
actually that would actually allow you

1079
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,760
to optimize out a lot of Transmissions

1080
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,020
um because you're gonna you're gonna get

1081
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,400
back that information that says yeah

1082
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,599
this just isn't supported on the network

1083
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,579
and you probably want to retry every so

1084
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:54,420
often

1085
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,800
just to make sure that it hasn't

1086
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,200
suddenly become supported but that makes

1087
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,240
things a little cleaner

1088
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,700
except Suresh Europe

1089
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,099
okay thanks um so there's two things I

1090
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:06,359
think like you know Eric you had a

1091
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,520
really good point right like about the

1092
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,339
um you know the uh ability to kind of

1093
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,440
stop at some point right uh one thing

1094
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,480
this is this is supposed to be a best

1095
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,980
best effort mechanism right like you

1096
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,720
know the idea would be to kind of keep

1097
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,400
it simple and say hey I'm forming an

1098
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,900
address with Slack

1099
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,359
I want to try to see if somebody wants

1100
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:25,920
to log this right because in most cases

1101
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,380
it's not going to be recorded like you

1102
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,579
know in home networks and stuff like

1103
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:30,839
that it's not going to happen right so

1104
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:31,920
it's going to be a managed Network

1105
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,720
that's going to use this right so that's

1106
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,640
one thing uh but the second thing was

1107
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,480
like

1108
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,740
um

1109
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,740
like

1110
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,099
yeah it sounds like Tuesday already

1111
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,599
so what was the last thing you said Eric

1112
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,400
no Eric Eric Levy uh

1113
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,619
exactly Okay so uh good one thank you

1114
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,839
thanks uh Lorenzo so I think the problem

1115
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,300
exists with or without this right so if

1116
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,099
you have temporary addresses like it's

1117
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,559
going to fill up a neighbor cache at the

1118
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,660
router right like so if we have a way of

1119
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,920
clearing it I think it's a really good

1120
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,020
idea no matter whether or not like it's

1121
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,700
done here or not it's something we can

1122
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,619
do because if somebody is saying I'm

1123
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,380
Gonna Give You X

1124
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,720
addresses per node right and like you

1125
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,280
know it's never getting clear then I

1126
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,540
think this is a good way to clear it and

1127
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,980
saying like I'm done with it right I

1128
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,420
think that could be a good thing to kind

1129
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,500
of follow up

1130
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,480
uh actually speaking of multicast if

1131
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,980
like where shark on my machine now

1132
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,500
amount of neighbor Discovery multicast

1133
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,720
packet sent by a host

1134
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,020
will probably will like much higher than

1135
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,599
what we see in in this case anyway so

1136
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,880
like I'm just yeah I'm fine I just said

1137
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,040
can we actually not adding too much of

1138
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,920
multicast here comparing to all other

1139
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,559
things UIC and right like

1140
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,500
like if you have V6 only Network and

1141
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,599
host doesn't know about that amount of

1142
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:03,540
our multicast stuff it's saying you can

1143
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,500
get just ridiculous anyway

1144
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,960
yeah so for them I think for there's a

1145
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,339
very important distinction between the

1146
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:15,599
ND cash size and this this is uh

1147
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,000
received by the server committed to a

1148
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,520
log or not and then it doesn't need to

1149
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,440
be kept whereas the ND cache does need

1150
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,420
to be kept so I don't know that this is

1151
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,579
the right actually message type to like

1152
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,319
clear the MD cache right and the ND

1153
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,359
cache also does lru and it needs to

1154
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:31,920
forget about stuff whereas the logging

1155
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,540
is if you use this for forensics

1156
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,099
purposes you have to keep it forever

1157
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,980
right or at least until you rock log

1158
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,680
rotation period expires so I I think the

1159
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,059
only question there Lorenzo would be is

1160
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,800
if you Market unavailable

1161
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,839
that would be keeping state in the

1162
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,079
server right yes if you had um but you

1163
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,760
know like in theory dad will take care

1164
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,680
of that because you know we have this

1165
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,660
problem today with slack and hpv6 where

1166
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,059
in theory like the dhpv6 server can hand

1167
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:58,500
out whatever it wants and anyone can

1168
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,119
form slack with whatever on some of them

1169
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,099
I totally agree I guess my point is if

1170
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,420
you're going to do a should here I think

1171
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,400
you'd have to clean it up because the

1172
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,500
servers yeah I guess we can say amazing

1173
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,000
because if we put shoot and then you

1174
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,380
start talking about it and they're like

1175
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,559
yeah

1176
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,800
yeah if you're having the DHCP server

1177
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,059
keep track of anything you're going to

1178
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:19,500
want to clean it so on the release

1179
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,500
actually that is what I like one thing I

1180
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,480
want to say is like yeah we we try to

1181
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,579
make this as simple as possible also too

1182
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,319
and you know particularly also to ensure

1183
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,500
that like you know it wasn't a barrier

1184
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,839
to implementation on the release I'm not

1185
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,640
like sure I understand how it would work

1186
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,160
because like the server needs to un like

1187
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,140
needs to obviously Time stuff out when

1188
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,359
when like because like clients can just

1189
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,460
disappear right and so if it doesn't do

1190
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,520
that then it runs out of space you know

1191
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,760
like basically and the other thing is so

1192
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,200
I'm not sure what a release would

1193
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,240
accomplish like you basically like save

1194
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,040
like maybe one message

1195
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,640
uh but that's it really because you do

1196
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,020
still have to refresh it while you're

1197
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,579
still there yeah from a forensics

1198
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:04,020
perspective I would assume it would let

1199
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,780
you know when something left right to be

1200
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,400
honest practically I don't know how

1201
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,520
often actually privacy extensions

1202
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,260
expires versus client dropping off the

1203
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,079
network going home coming back next day

1204
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,119
with different privacy I just don't have

1205
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,480
data because I would expect I don't know

1206
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,980
what's the what's the Privacy extensions

1207
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,040
lifetime like at 24 hours yeah yeah not

1208
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,780
so many clients actually stay in for

1209
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,079
like some snow but there's another you

1210
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,640
know there's another obviously issue

1211
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,260
with sending the releases that like you

1212
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,819
if you have to send it from The Source

1213
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,200
address that you're currently that

1214
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,300
you're not using you have to do that

1215
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,400
before you release it but but I guess we

1216
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,020
could I mean it would also like um

1217
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,780
require an additional message type so I

1218
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,240
I really think about it I really yeah

1219
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,380
I'm really not sure about the trade-off

1220
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,020
here but yeah it's not opposed to adding

1221
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,180
release it's just I'm not sure it's that

1222
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,500
useful yeah yeah yeah yeah

1223
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,839
so everything without any yet not even

1224
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,119
the head of somebody we've reviewed the

1225
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,500
draft right so I didn't read it he said

1226
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,780
the slides so

1227
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,700
release I think it's it's nice to have

1228
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,800
it it may mean in the in the locks

1229
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,180
because if you see this address coming

1230
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,040
up later you know something fishy has

1231
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,900
happened but anyway

1232
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,660
my point is more that why are you asking

1233
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,180
proposing this only for the end points

1234
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,700
you say you rely on the Layer Two And

1235
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,920
The Savvy switches

1236
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,200
they also know the mapping between the

1237
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,540
IPv6 address appearing at some point of

1238
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,280
time they don't get a duid of course

1239
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,680
right I don't know what so send this

1240
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,200
information from service switches

1241
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,839
would be useful as well uh you know what

1242
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,040
I I

1243
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,920
try to say this is the draft is not a

1244
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,859
silver ballet we post to be a single

1245
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:48,420
source of information about all

1246
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,460
addresses used in the network especially

1247
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,260
if you start talking about forensics

1248
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,540
perspective right ideally what you have

1249
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,980
you have this you have your neighbor

1250
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,859
cash entry from routers you have your

1251
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:01,140
Savvy information all together will give

1252
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,119
you a reasonably full picture about

1253
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,000
what's going on right so

1254
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,119
um doing it from the switches well I

1255
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,559
guess you get this information from

1256
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,599
switches it's much better way like

1257
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,040
streaming Telemetry and other stuff

1258
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,339
right

1259
00:56:19,819 --> 00:56:22,200
I guess right it will simplify the

1260
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,579
operation on the network because you get

1261
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,680
a single source of Truth as you say to

1262
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,440
the HTTP if all the switches doing savvy

1263
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,599
are implementing this and the release

1264
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,540
then is is clear right

1265
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,900
oh maybe

1266
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,579
what Eric might be saying is like just

1267
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,339
have just let's say in the draft that

1268
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,200
switches can send this on behalf of

1269
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,880
clients that don't implement this right

1270
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,980
I I think that that's yeah that's why I

1271
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,180
say you don't think you understand but

1272
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,800
and that's I think it's okay except

1273
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,240
technically as worded that the address

1274
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,920
has to come the message has to come from

1275
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,420
the source address and so the switch

1276
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,460
would have to spoof it but maybe it's

1277
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,800
okay uh yeah maybe it would put it in a

1278
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,980
relay message right I don't know yeah uh

1279
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,740
wait are we talking about DHCP clients

1280
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,520
on switches now

1281
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,579
are you going to be

1282
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:14,540
younger people

1283
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,619
yeah something to think about

1284
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:20,760
um okay so two minutes left good job um

1285
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,619
the only thing I'm gonna add is this is

1286
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:25,500
a DHCP participant I would definitely

1287
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,380
use the DHCP retransmit timer having

1288
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,200
tested boatloads of clients they barely

1289
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,880
get that right I think adding another

1290
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,220
one would be

1291
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,900
problematic at best would be my advice

1292
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,480
but you you do what you want but I I'm

1293
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,579
sort of with Bernie on that computer

1294
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:44,099
smart people and suggestions yeah that's

1295
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,480
why we're here

1296
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,760
yeah so it's basically eight that's why

1297
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,800
we put it on the slides uh because we

1298
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,300
realize it might be better hiding yeah

1299
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,940
okay so um yeah I think we can do

1300
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,260
there's a lot of interest in this draft

1301
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,000
so I think we should do an adoption call

1302
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,520
we'll do it on list thank you very much

1303
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,500
yeah thanks everybody

1304
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,660
Okay so

1305
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,280
here we are at the end

1306
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,720
um a couple of things just to remind

1307
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,119
everybody please work in group adoption

1308
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,339
calls for I think we're gonna do one for

1309
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:13,559
that draft and for we've already have

1310
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,319
one going for 8415 please respond on

1311
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,440
list if you can that would be great
