29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,140
the co-chairs

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,659
um based on the messages from Sarah I'm

31
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,100
not sure whether she will be able to

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,360
join us today

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,659
but uh we will uh muddle onward so

34
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,140
um this is the benchmarking methodology

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,659
uh working group session and we got a

36
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,040
couple hours here

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,619
if you're not subscribed to BMW gmailing

38
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,840
list uh this is the place where you can

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,140
do that

40
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,020
okay

41
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,420
uh note well

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,699
um the the special no well for our group

43
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,000
is that we we work as individuals try to

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,099
be nice to each other that's usually

45
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,860
pretty easy to do we all have a common

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,800
interest in testing here and

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,900
benchmarking so let's just leave it at

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,860
that you've seen the um the IDF policies

49
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,140
probably various times while

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,940
participating in the meeting

51
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,500
so um feel free to

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,200
you know delve into this further

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,080
basically any contribution

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,120
you make it the meeting could be a

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,940
statement at the microphone uh email to

56
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,580
the list all sorts of things of that

57
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,060
nature so uh they're all subject to

58
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,160
itf's policies and procedures

59
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,340
so here's our agenda

60
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,120
um

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,879
we've got the status and the

62
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,220
uh

63
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,840
proposal proposals and adoptions to talk

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
through

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,000
we've got the multiple loss ratio search

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,860
we've got some slides on that that's

67
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,800
actually uh 03 now

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,019
a quick update on

69
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,140
Next Generation firewall

70
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,140
um

71
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,519
we've got some new slides for the Yang

72
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,019
data model and also slides for the

73
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,840
benchmarking methodology for stateful

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,040
non-xy gateways

75
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,860
I've uploaded all of these if you can't

76
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,200
see them I guess it's because the

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
uh the system is lagging behind

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,900
uh the updates

79
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,299
um so you know I'm sorry for that but

80
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,000
don't worry we'll get the slides

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,560
presented in any case

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,239
and then um

83
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,580
we'll be looking at the proposals here

84
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,700
the considerations from

85
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,180
um benchmarking mailroom performance

86
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,400
containerized infrastructures

87
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
um also methodology for mpls Segment

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,239
routing and V6 segment routing and

89
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,160
problems and requirements for evaluation

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,579
of integration spelling iterate space

91
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,660
and uh terrestrial Networks

92
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,259
so um any bashing of the agenda needed

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
um hearing none then we'll just go ahead

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,139
with that

95
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,960
um so it's a it's important to point out

96
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,759
that there is a

97
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,860
you know there's a really easy notetaker

98
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,419
facility here

99
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,259
made available in Meet Techo

100
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,180
um obviously I'll be trying to take a

101
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,600
few notes as we go along but if anybody

102
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,479
else would like to jump in and help type

103
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,060
a few notes on the questions and answers

104
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,180
to come up uh that would be great

105
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,979
so please help out if you can

106
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,680
um we've uh we've got a fairly easy way

107
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,300
to follow the Jabber

108
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,460
uh I'm

109
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,440
uh you know I can bring that up pretty

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,840
quickly if I see an alert for that

111
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,720
but um if somebody else sees a note in

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,419
the jabber and I don't see it feel free

113
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,919
to go to the mic and bring into my

114
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:26,880
attention

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
thank you

116
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
all right

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
so I think we're good there

118
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,300
uh the status is that we've got all the

119
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,680
iesg

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,580
uh discuss ballots have been resolved

121
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,479
got a large rewrite that's uh come to

122
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,520
fruition on the multiple loss race car

123
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,660
search

124
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,960
looks like some good progress there

125
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,419
we've adopted the Yang model draft and

126
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,180
also the staple and that XY Gateway

127
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,500
drafts

128
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,199
and we've still got lots of proposals to

129
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,259
deal with so I encourage people to read

130
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,960
the proposed drafts and give us some

131
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,220
comments that'll be a basis for uh

132
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,080
considering you know what we begin to

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,639
adopt and when

134
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,160
and we've uh we've got some drafts in

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,740
that list that have really shown

136
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,280
um you know lots of progress and lots of

137
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,620
uh you know hackathon work and lots of

138
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,220
um

139
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,840
uh you know new drafts and then

um additional uh work going on so you

141
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,060
know there's there's additional work we

142

want to adopt there I think and I

143
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,800
encourage you to consider those uh those

144
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,440

okay

153

154
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,180
but um

155
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,819

156
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:15,720
for

157
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,400
quite a long time

158
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,819

159
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,039
about how to join the group or how the

160

working group page

162
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,300
it's hosted here

163
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,240
so feel free to take a look at that and

is uh where we've done done with the

168
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,740

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,240
some of these others

172
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,259
um

173
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,060
I don't think we've got much progress

174
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,720
going on on the automation uh drafts

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,060
that we were seeing for a while so we

176
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,699
may consider dropping this and we also

177
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,520
have to add a milestone for the

178
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,000
benchmarking for stateful net xy

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
gateways

180
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,259
so that's uh that's some background work

181
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,599
that the chairs have to have to pick up

182
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,460
but uh we'll we'll do that in the

183
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,979
fullness of time

184
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,319
so any questions about the working group

185
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,620
status

186
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,479
okay very good

187
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,740
so let's uh let's see what we've got uh

188
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,060
SlideShare wise here

189
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,440
so I see that um

190
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,420
you know for whatever reason multiple

191
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,100
loss ratio search

192
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,660
made it into the uh the Dex the easy

193
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,040
decks to share so I'm uh I'm doing that

194
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,420
one

195
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,699
that's our next uh deck up here

196
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,959
and I see that we have um

197
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,440
mosiak and viratko uh uh both present

198
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,779
today so

199
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,320
um

200
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,899
uh all of you guys will be uh doing the

201
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,500
presenting today

202
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,220
looks like masiak

203
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,500
hi uh hi everybody hi all uh hopefully

204
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
you can hear me

205
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,160
yeah we can see you in here you masiak

206
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
excellent oh welcome so uh we actually

207
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,380
presented uh uh together I'm gonna do

208
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,300
first few slides and then I'm gonna hand

209
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,100
over to ratko

210
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,360
to talk about uh next level of detail

211
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,300
so uh another video and the Feats are

212
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,519
going ahead then let's

213
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,040
let's get going

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
uh so uh welcome everyone again

215
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,000
um I am we have posted the uh the third

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
division of the slide after the deadline

217
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,720
so apologies for that it is a bit of the

218
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,019
rewrite as all your demands uh

219
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,560
uh how do I can I move the slides or can

220
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,620
you move the slides for me hey I have to

221
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,660
do it so uh sorry for that okay so next

222
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,279
slide please

223
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,779
okay yeah so we posted uh the uh the

224
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,880
updated version on the 9th of November

225
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,800
uh we did not manage to push it before

226
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
the deadline and uh the draft is still

227
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,959
very much a work in progress next slide

228
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,500
okay

229
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,660
so

230
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,940
what are the major updates

231
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,380
um

232
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,040
we had a very good feedback from the a

233
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,019
working group thanks to Al Gabor and

234
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,279
Vladimir

235
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,519
um and he made us realize that we need

236
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,800
to actually spend time to better

237
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,820
articulate and two things first spend

238
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,500
more time on replicating the problem

239
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,420
statement

240
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,800
um and um and uh and then uh approach

241
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,760
the basically describe the approach uh

242
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,519
to each uh and every of those uh

243
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
problems that we are proposing with mlr

244
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,079
search methodology and um and supported

245
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,260
by the the code we have been uh running

246
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,079
in the uh LF fan of the iel assistant

247
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,220
project

248
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,440
so that this is what the

249
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,720
third revision is about

250
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,240
um it is a major rewrite the concepts

251
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,600
are very much the same uh but then we

252
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,740
did we did spend time to uh really uh

253
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,860
separate the problems so again thanks to

254
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,680
I think it was Vladimir who articulated

255
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,019
it very well in one of the emails uh

256
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,760
about a year ago I think so um

257
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,420
um we also have done another thing um we

258
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,880
have applied stricter discipline in

259
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,760
terms of the terms uh we're using

260
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,579
um so we have been using a number of

261
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,040
terms from the open source project uh we

262
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,019
have a revised number of BMW G rfcs 1242

263
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:21,120
2285 and 2544 of course

264
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,320
and um and we have uh reference to the

265
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
number of terms there

266
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,920
um including offered loads maximum

267
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,260
overload forwarding rate and forwarding

268
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,959
great at maximum overload and such

269
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,440
so those references are now uh there and

270
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,519
are used

271
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,820
um quite strictly in our review uh the

272
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,200
when we describe the um the methodology

273
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,560
what we have removed

274
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,000
um from the um from the draft is a

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,800
direct references to the implementation

276
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,480
we realized that

277
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,880
uh they may have been

278
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,180
um long and sort of Meandering and

279
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,820
confusing and and some of them got a bit

280
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,760
outdated Radko will uh we'll talk

281
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,399
everybody through the the versions

282
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,260
um of the mlr search uh as the

283
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,440
methodology evolved um a bit

284
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,579
and um and really the

285
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,100
um the focus on problem statement and

286
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,040
the and the explanation of methodology

287
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,399
we are targeting the BMW G uh Community

288
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,079
to help us Harden both of these

289
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,060
um and and of course you know validate

290
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,459
uh validate them as a first and and

291
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,380
force most

292
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,160
uh next slide

293
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,339
so a quick recap on what uh multiple

294
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,380
loss ratio search is

295
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,959
um or why we're doing it and and what

296
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,079
are the goals um so mlr search is about

297
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,760
improving

298
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,660
um and enhancing uh the throughput

299
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,600
search that is specified in rrc2544

300
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,940
and just to emphasize it it's about

301
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,760
enhancing and improving not replacing

302
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,880
and in fact mlr search is compatible

303
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,320
with RFC 24 Triple H with a certain

304
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,079
input parameters

305
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,959
what is driving us uh what is driving us

306
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,720
to Define uh um this improved Network

307
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,240
throughput searches the challenges we

308
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,959
have faced when testing nav systems and

309
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,720
and other software-based networking

310
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,940
systems

311
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,860
um what is specific about those systems

312
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,360
is that

313
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,920
um we we do need to

314
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,440
execute a large volume of those tests

315
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,660
for those systems and and also the

316
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,380
behavior there is not as deterministic

317
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,100
as we have seen uh with hardware and

318
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,019
networking systems so the three

319
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,860
objectives or three goals that we are

320
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,320
aiming to address with mlr search are we

321
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,899
want to minimize the overall duration

322
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,480
the test execution

323
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,339
we want to search

324
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:19,440
multiple loss ratios so

325
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,079
um performance of the device at

326
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,060
different loss ratios including zero

327
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,000
loss and we also want to improve the

328
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,180
results repeatability and comparability

329
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,959
across implementations of the mlr search

330
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,560
and throughput search and across uh you

331
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,240
know instances of execution including

332
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,680
between the different labs

333
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,000
next slide

334
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,480
foreign

335
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:55,620
the bullets here are really uh related

336
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,279
uh are

337
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,980
corresponding one to one to the sections

338
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,139
or subsections in the latest version of

339
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,220
the draft

340
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,920
so we we have split the the problem

341
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,100
statement into the sort of Five Points

342
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,019
the first one is about the long test

343
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,820
duration

344
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,540
um

345
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,720
throughput search as specified in RFC to

346
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,600
5.4 is just too slow

347
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,639
um

348
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,820
for for software networking

349
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,279
um specifically for environments where

350
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,160
the continuous test execution

351
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,860
is part of the development Pipeline and

352
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,820
of evaluation pipeline so covering you

353
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,259
know it's basically executing number of

354
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,820
tests

355
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,040
um covering multitude of different

356
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,920
packets processing modes and and

357
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,720
different configurations

358
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,920
so so we need to basically reduce the

359
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,980
overall execution time second problem is

360
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,339
related to what we are testing the

361
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,339
system that we are testing so

362
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,760
we have uh we we within the draft we are

363
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,480
distinguishing between the dut and Duty

364
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,660
being the the actual software program a

365
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,540
software processing packets which is of

366
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,740
interest to the to Benchmark and Sut is

367
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,959
something that is you know around the

368
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,480
magnets for a run the server Hub is the

369
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
operating system and

370
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
um we've shared resources and

371
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,320
potentially other software programs

372
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,799
running on that very system so we refer

373
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,440
to it as the UT being effectively nested

374
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
within within that system

375
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,559
and and we also recognize that the

376
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,240
performance that we are measuring from

377
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,320
outside

378
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,039
um the SUV performance is a spectrum and

379
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,559
um and what we are after is the

380
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,500
noiseless and noiseless ant of that of

381
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,100
that Spectrum

382
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,299
reputable repeatability and

383
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,220
compatibility already talked about it's

384
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,419
uh about uh being able to

385
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,640
reproduce the results uh easily

386
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,520
um and um and and compare

387
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,900
the other aspect is measuring the

388
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,380
throughput but with non-zero loss

389
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,080
um and

390
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,600
we've observed in the industry that uh

391
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,720
what is common uh when testing uh nav

392
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,360
and software Solutions uh networking

393
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,919
Solutions

394
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,400
um the zero frame loss is not as popular

395
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,539
as as the non-zero frame loss and um and

396
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,280
we would like to capture uh capture that

397
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
and make the search procedure user

398
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,100
friendly to allow people to end the labs

399
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,059
to characterize the a range of a range

400
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,580
of performance and not excluding zero

401
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,400
loss but rather

402
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,380
adding the non-zero loss performance and

403
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,240
do it in a systematic manner

404
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,039
and the last one is

405
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:02,900
um

406
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,720
related to inconsistency of of trial

407
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,980
results that may happen during the

408
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,740
search and the search approach needs to

409
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,080
be able to to handle those especially

410
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,840
when we are searching for both non-zero

411
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,440
and zero and and when we encounter a

412
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,340
non-zero loss trials that are

413
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,620
um with smaller load that are a smaller

414
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,900
load than for zero loss trials so

415
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,919
handling the inconsistency in the

416
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,200
deterministic manner and is is one of

417
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,940
the problems that we have also would

418
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,660
like to recognize

419
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,700
uh next slide

420
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,620
please

421
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,160
so we included the terminology

422
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,500
um update it is much more compact than

423
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,220
the previous versions and again we are

424
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,980
referencing uh existing specifications

425
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,320
from the BMW G

426
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,679
um the the the three major ones

427
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,740
um are well the throughput as defined in

428
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,020
RFC to 544 no change there it must be

429
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,860
zero loss and then we are introducing uh

430
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,900
something we refer to as conditional

431
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,820
throughput

432
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,340
um and and the term is we're using is

433
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,620
for non-zero loss

434
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,160
um and it's a it's a throughput that is

435
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,500
measured under you know with a number of

436
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,679
conditions it coincides it's equal to

437
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,480
the throughput when the loss ratio goal

438
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,160
is set to zero

439
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,559
but in fact it is referring to the

440
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,480
forwarding rate

441
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,140
um and as specified in the RFC 2285

442
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,820
um

443
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,439
for non-zero loss richer goals

444
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,640
um the um the another important uh

445
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,980
terminology update is the uh the the

446
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,220
lower upper bound we're using this term

447
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,260
um uh quite heavily

448
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,260
um when describing the methodology

449
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,340
um they are usually relative to the

450
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,020
they're always relative to the current

451
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,799
search phase and it is uh actually uh

452
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,500
the handling of those bounds

453
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,400
um that is uh the Crux of the or the

454
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,440
core of

455
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,140
um of the uh efficiency of the of the of

456
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,620
the approach

457
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,380
um so with that

458
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,419
um Al would you mind uh going to the

459
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,919
next slide and I would like to hand over

460
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,039
to Radko

461
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,039
hello this is not black speaking uh so

462
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,120
I'll continue the top slides uh so we

463
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,900
have simplified the description of our

464
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,880
search we are no longer calling it an

465
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,760
algorithm we are calling it

466
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,100
methodology because some pieces are

467
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,360
missing but this is the main structure

468
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,520
so first of all there are main inputs

469
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,400
which control what the

470
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,299
reported value will be at the end and as

471
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,220
mentioned a very small special goal

472
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,740
which can be zero non-zero and there is

473
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,940
a target trial duration which

474
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,400
governs how long the final file should

475
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,179
be the one that will be turned into the

476
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,400
result and also started Precision

477
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,460
basically when doing the

478
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,559
minor researcher at the end how close

479
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,539
the lower bound and upper bound should

480
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,520
be

481
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,820
the search happens in as a sequence of

482
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,240
phases there is single initial phase and

483
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,179
then there are multiple middle phases at

484
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,780
the final phases by the way earlier that

485
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,679
measures those middle phases were called

486
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,460
intermediate phases but no we choose

487
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,480
this thing so the initial phase is there

488
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,020
to Kickstart the other other phases and

489
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,120
it is also the source of time

490
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,659
spent compared to the usual approaches

491
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,960
basically we are doing three trials one

492
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,559
is done at the maximum overload another

493
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,640
one is done in the frame rate

494
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,559
the forwarding rate of that previous

495
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,580
trial and once again we we use forward

496
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,760
the grade of the second trial to

497
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,200
use as a load for the third trial and uh

498
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,679
there is mol and frmol that was already

499
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,980
defined in RFC 2285 and we just

500
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,380
introduce frfrmol

501
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,840
the next iteration

502
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,159
turns out a frmol is

503
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,159
working good as a upper bound and FRFR

504
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,360
mol works good as a lower Bound

505
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,400
in the definitions of up about and lower

506
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,220
bound we allow each bounce to be valid

507
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,000
or invalid so it does not matter if

508
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,220
frfrm oil load still leads to not zero

509
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,780
loss the middle phase will headlight

510
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,940
speaking about the middle phases now we

511
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,280
are explicit there are four actions

512
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,120
executed in that middle phase so

513
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,000
we are not calling it The optimizations

514
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,780
they are specific for actions that are

515
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,539
always adapted not always need it but

516
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,900
always

517
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,740
evaluate it

518
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,960
no space to go to there but the

519
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,760
important thing is that each middle

520
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,620
phase needs

521
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,780
starting balls like starting over

522
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,880
there's nothing cover about which

523
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,580
usually come from the previous phase but

524
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,940
not always and turn them into the ending

525
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,360
bounds

526
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,600
we are still debating how to improve the

527
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,760
terminology

528
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,460
usually I say something like there is a

529
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,419
phase goal which includes

530
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,820
translation for that specific phase and

531
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,919
so on so we still need to clear that out

532
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,100
but the

533
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,640
idea is clear we are

534
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,120
iteratively improving getting closer to

535
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,159
the Target translation and Target

536
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,779
position

537
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,840
that we are using the fact that middle

538
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,539
phase is are shorter than the final

539
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,559
phases

540
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,799
speaking about the Final Phase is uh the

541
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,500
logic there is exactly the same as the

542
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
middle face but the rib is different

543
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,620
just because this is the phase that uses

544
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,720
the target Cloud version Target

545
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,580
precision and also the lower bound more

546
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,620
specifically forwarding it's probably

547
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,400
great at the lower bound this is the

548
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,740
quality that is retired as the condition

549
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,200
of the robot

550
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,159
and there is uh there is a one final

551
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,700
phase for each ratio goal and

552
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,279
uh

553
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,200
sequence of middle phase is is preceding

554
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,480
each Final Phase so

555
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,299
there is Final Phase for the first goal

556
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,760
and only then start middle phases for

557
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,940
the second goal and so on and so on

558
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,740
okay next slide please

559
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,640
yeah uh this is a

560
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,419
way too complicated so

561
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,120
it is not important for you to

562
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,520
understand every little detail here but

563
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,940
this is basically the

564
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,260
an explanation of uh why the draft is

565
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,440
trading so much so there is a table the

566
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,279
table has a five rows basically

567
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,580
each row is one implementation of the

568
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,240
mlr search and the logic of that

569
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,419
implementation is different so there are

570
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,159
few columns

571
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,380
and

572
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,860
this is an example that when one column

573
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,580
changes that needed significant editor

574
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:26,580
in the draft text so version 0 1 of the

575
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,039
draft was exactly the First Column where

576
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,460
the zero two was using the the second

577
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,740
row this is uh what we are still running

578
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,840
in the cc2 production version zero six

579
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,120
which is not now uploaded

580
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,419
mostly is matching the

581
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:51,299
next production already code which we

582
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,580
are loaded using but we'll be using in

583
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,740
the next release

584
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,299
and the reason why we spent so much time

585
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,480
writing these drafts and remove the most

586
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,120
of the detail is not row number four

587
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,440
where I had an idea and implemented it

588
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,039
and then decided the time gates are not

589
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,480
good enough so I've already been

590
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,120
training number five

591
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,760
and I expect that

592
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,159
version zero four on the draft will be

593
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,520
describing the row number five maybe

594
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,840
even

595
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,840
something more so there are subtle

596
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,200
changes I will talk about the big one

597
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,840
later

598
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,679
and uh

599
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,799
this is why you are not describing all

600
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
the details

601
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,299
yet in this version because

602
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,220
I said

603
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,919
in some previous presentations this

604
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,200
draft started as a description of

605
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,840
an algorithm of a code that we were

606
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,200
running and we are already now

607
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,799
protecting it so that there can be just

608
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,779
one specification

609
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,360
of optimal search methodology that is

610
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,900
compatible with multiple different

611
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,940
cold versions and

612
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,120
all of them can be called Larson we are

613
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,580
not there yet but we are hoping together

614
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,879
next slide please

615
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,760
maybe it will be a good story talk about

616
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,640
the second Point first because I started

617
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,340
to talk about it in the previous slide

618
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,460
uh there is uh compatibility with binary

619
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,080
research and with lost Burbank

620
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,600
verification that is uh

621
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,100
and another extension of a RFC to 544

622
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,440
which was used in a RFC nine zero zero

623
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,279
the the last number but it is possible

624
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,159
to introduce

625
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,399
more input parameters to mlr search

626
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,320
and uh

627
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,480
turn the mlr search to be compatible

628
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,220
with that basically you can Implement

629
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,080
binary search with most verification

630
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,340
inside

631
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,779
the version 4 of mlr search and this

632
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,100
will be another

633
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,220
tool for people who wants to get more

634
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,960
stable results even with facing with SSD

635
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,539
that has large spectrums so there is big

636
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,740
difference between load almost always

637
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,960
get zero loss and upload that almost

638
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,260
never but sometimes gets

639
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,960
so we are hoping that this will be more

640
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,179
useful for the immunity but

641
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,399
we were not able to

642
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,820
describe it in this version are too many

643
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,299
changes

644
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,179
in the terminology and how the algorithm

645
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,320
handles it

646
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,659
uh also uh

647
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,960
this zero three version does not address

648
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,640
the important question of consist of

649
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,799
inconsistent trial

650
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,020
this is

651
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,980
somehow related to

652
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,419
once again

653
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,580
to answer of the SCT performance

654
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,039
Spectrum

655
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,559
you can use

656
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,100
decisions that prefer one end or other

657
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,340
end but uh

658
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,520
this is very important for comparability

659
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,460
if you have one implementation that you

660
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,120
prefers model that prefect otherwise it

661
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,899
is

662
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,059
literal that one of them will be

663
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,940
reporting a lower number than other evil

664
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,520
Winters need the time Duty

665
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,440
and uh

666
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,620
those decisions needs to be

667
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,980
introduced in the definitions of lower

668
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,200
bound and yeah Final Phase call we

669
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
probably don't be the name in the next

670
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,659
rough version but basically some of the

671
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,020
definitions that are in the two of three

672
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,779
versions are not big enough for the

673
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:16,020
comparability is not the current

674
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,200
yeah hey uh I'm sorry we need to wrap

675
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,279
this up

676
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:26,700
oh okay basically the last item is uh

677
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,659
what we as authors are what probably

678
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:32,940
bmwg basically we both

679
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,960
to review focus on the problems because

680
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,360
the problems is the part that we are

681
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,960
happy with and if Community agrees these

682
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,080
are the problems we can proceed in

683
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,539
describing the Solutions in the next

684
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,940
block version thank you

685
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,240
thanks thanks Mercy I can write about

686
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,320
and um so I think that uh you're you

687
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,539
know you've got a work in progress here

688
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,159
that's uh

689
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,399
um you know uh on its way to uh the

690
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,640
state where you want it to be and uh I

691
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,740
suppose if folks have a chance to uh

692
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,919
take a look at the current draft

693
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,179
um especially if you've read it before

694
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,340
and and see the direction that's

695
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,159
changing see the direction it's going

696
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:22,580
maybe that would be good feedback to our

697
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,260
co-authors here to uh you know either

698
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,299
let them know they're in the right uh

699
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,460
quadrant or uh well you know how much

700
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,460
more they've got to do so uh that's

701
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,960
great

702
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,880
um thank you both for your uh for your

703
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,179
efforts and uh preparing this and uh

704
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,679
we'll hopefully ask some more comments

705
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,760
by the next time we get together

706
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,860
okay

707
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,140
so um

708
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,340
our next topic is uh the benchmarking

709
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,039
methodology for network security

710
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,960
device performance

711
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,380
and um there's no slide deck on this

712
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,419
today but uh

713
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:07,580
um let's see I got a chat here

714
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:14,040
so oh yeah okay okay there was some um

715
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,440
there was some chatting there off

716
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,719
uh during the presentation and then

717
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,520
that's good I think it's I think it's

718
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,440
been resolved good

719
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,199
all right uh the last round so let's

720
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,080
work on uh let's go back to this um

721
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,379
security device performance all the

722
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,540
discuss ballots have finally been

723
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,719
resolved uh that took about I don't know

724
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,540
about eight months but um

725
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,300
but it was a lot of work by the authors

726
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,418
to uh deal with many many comments here

727
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,179
and then obviously discuss ballots are

728
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,800
blocking

729
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,399
um the main question uh is I don't think

730
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,260
they're the approved announcement

731
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,920
has been sent for this and um so we're

732
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,200
sort of looking to warn for a timeline

733
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,099
on

734
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,800
uh when you can review the latest draft

735
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,180
and maybe release that approval

736
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,920
announcement

737
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,300
um but I'll wait till Warren's back in

738
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,000
the room to uh pursue this a bit

739
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,180
okay

740
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,619
so um moving on to the next topic

741
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,400
which uh Vladimir has supplied a couple

742
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,500
of slides for

743
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,599
um we've got the Yang data model for

744
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,119
Network test error management

745
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,599
and I'll wait Warren's here

746
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,880
uh Warren did you hear my question

747
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,000
yep yeah Warren's been here he just I

748
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,440
guess sitting off camera so you didn't

749
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,619
know uh yep uh hopefully sort of just

750
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,720
after the ietf meeting finishes I'll be

751
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,220
able to send that just need to go and

752
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,960
review and make sure they're all

753
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,760
all met but yeah I think that the

754
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,280
disgust was cleared just before the

755
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,560
meeting so yep hopefully just after the

756
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,420
meeting I'll be able to do one final

757
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,000
review and then click the or sort of do

758
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,180
the final approval bit so yep

759
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,460
and would you prefer me to be sitting

760
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,520
desk I'd figured often decides better

761
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,780
out of the way but whichever you'd

762
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,079
prefer

763
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,579
um well I I just wanted to be able to

764
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,420
see when you're in the room and and not

765
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,599
so that uh yeah so that I don't talk

766
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,940
about it

767
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,200
but uh uh which is you know uh the only

768
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,579
thing I have to say are good things

769
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:36,660
Warren

770
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,960
the um but uh I guess wherever you're

771
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,240
sitting wherever you're sitting it was

772
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,320
off camera

773
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,260
and uh and right there I can see your

774
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,500
hat so that's great

775
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,540
perfect thanks a lot

776
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,740
okay

777
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,460
well um so that I think that's a that's

778
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,859
a really good outcome and uh we thank

779
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,540
the co-authors for all the really hard

780
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,980
work on the uh security devices uh draft

781
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,200
and uh we'll be looking forward to your

782
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,599
uh your final review there Warren much

783
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,079
appreciated

784
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,440
all right so let me see if I can uh Now

785
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,420
find and present

786
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,560
uh the Yang model drafts uh

787
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,420
if for some reason they're not showing

788
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,000
up in the decks ready to be shared

789
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,980
so let me look at the updates here

790
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,680
meeting materials

791
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,119
so they're in the meeting materials

792
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,320
I'll refresh this

793
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,400
back to pre-loaded

794
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,220
still not showing up okay

795
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,959
so I'm going to share my screen

796
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,619
and I'll share screen tube

797
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,260
and here you can see uh you can see I

798
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,599
updated I uploaded this deck

799
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,540
but uh then I go over to the pre-loaded

800
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,820
slides

801
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,680
oops

802
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,220
when I go over the pre-loaded slides

803
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,200
uh Yang is not showing up

804
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,119
so

805
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,900
back here

806
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,900
then

807
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,640
okay

808
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,760
so I can't see the queue right now and I

809
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,740
can't see the

810
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,880
um

811
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,099
you know the mic situation

812
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,040
but um so if you need to make some

813
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,780
comments here just make some noise and

814
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,720
uh I think that'll work fine

815
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,920
um Vladimir are you ready to go yeah

816
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,000
um

817
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,420
it's not a big with all the slides it's

818
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,780
no like a great deal of detail in there

819
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,380
so I can just go quickly about

820
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,240
that's why it's only one someone is

821
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,099
interesting he can probably download

822
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,960
them later

823
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,520
can you hear me

824
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,460
yeah I can hear you fine and and like I

825
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,020
said the slides are available for

826
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,000
download

827
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,599
yeah so I can just go quickly uh to the

828
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,520
slides so

829
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,800
the first one it is uh draft status and

830
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,500
it's work in progress

831
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,079
there are no outstanding issues raised

832
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,000
on the list right now

833
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,440
and

834
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,760
the running code is in the OK shape with

835
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,640
significant yet not full coverage of the

836
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,140
model features

837
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,180
so we have

838
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,880
a single stream

839
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,060
not a multi-stream implementation yet

840
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,780
and a very basic modifier implementation

841
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,140
a single 16-bit modifier which was just

842
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,640
implemented during the

843
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,440
so we're going to the next slide is

844
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,900
a description of the draft changes from

845
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,780
zero to one version of the draft which

846
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,540
was submitted to the mailing list

847
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,480
some some weeks before ITF

848
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
conference and it's pretty much the same

849
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,119
what stays in that email that's what the

850
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,380
slides contains and it states

851
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,079
one

852
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,900
modifiers are added Dynamic data field

853
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,880
of data functionality to the generator

854
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,640
model and example configuration where

855
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,380
action type

856
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,200
which can be either increment decrement

857
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,020
or random

858
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,119
offset mask and repetitions count

859
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,520
parameters can be specified

860
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,540
and this is not uncommon for many of the

861
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,420
proprietary traffic generators so you

862
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,859
can specify

863
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,500
in a way portion of the the frame that

864
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,960
has to be dynamically changed so you can

865
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,300
increment

866
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,339
or decrement this field

867
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,339
so it seems

868
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,300
it's quite

869
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,740
flexible what we have in the draft now

870
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,839
and we might need to constrain it a bit

871
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,980
because it's not only 16 bits or 24 bits

872
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,859
uh

873
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,680
modifiers you can specify currently it's

874
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,680
like a bit field which specifies the

875
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,900
mask and it's not constrained in any way

876
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,140
so we should consider some some sort of

877
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,839
constraint so that it's not impossible

878
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,680
to implement it without the deviation

879
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,500
this is to be

880
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,599
I'm thinking about that and we should

881
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,359
probably have a discussion and decide on

882
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,000
something there but for now it's uh like

883
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,020
open

884
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,960
the second point is removed where the

885
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,440
ethernet specifics that static data

886
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,740
fields like specifying Source address

887
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,320
Source Mark address destination markers

888
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,940
and ethernet type

889
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,619
which existed but they were like a

890
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,200
subset of the flexibility provided by

891
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,619
the the general Frame data mechanism

892
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:50,000
which is what most of the the

893
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,680
people programming this generator will

894
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,420
be using anyway so having this

895
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,960
redundancy just increase complexity and

896
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,040
puts dependency on one technology which

897
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,819
um

898
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,760
I don't think it's necessary so it could

899
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,700
be just removed without having all the

900
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,440
all the issues with properly defining it

901
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,380
and the third point is in the changes is

902
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,140
the editorial changes which were made on

903
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,480
the proposed on the mailing lists and

904
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,040
they're now applied

905
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,480
so

906
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,140
this is going to the next slide which

907
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,720
summarizes the hackathon activity

908
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,260
and it's not much we just added the the

909
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,380
simplest implementation of this kind of

910
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,819
modifier

911
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:42,540
which just takes from uh from the

912
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,880
configuration this

913
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,380
single modifier which

914
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,540
it is a list in the model but the

915
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,720
implementation just

916
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,800
fails everything that he has more than

917
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,240
one modifier so it just takes the

918
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,640
parameters through this modifier

919
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,040
and allows you to implement a basic RFC

920
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,339
2889 Benchmark like you can put a bridge

921
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:11,280
with incrementing Mac addresses and

922
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,640
determine what is its limit that's like

923
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,099
an application that proves the concepts

924
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,319
that's why this was added because

925
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,240
otherwise it will be possible to

926
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,160
implement such a benchmark or it would

927
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,220
be extremely slow like you need

928
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,339
commit transaction for each Mac address

929
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,319
you want to add to the table that would

930
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:35,760
be use useless so

931
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,680
so uh

932
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,900
and another thing that was worked on the

933
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,240
hackathon was resolving uh

934
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,700
issues with the two chains upgrading to

935
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,920
like updated dependencies with the

936
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,280
latest version of Debian and python tree

937
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,880
and other boring things that are not I'm

938
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,920
not going to go into detail there

939
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,420
and uh there is a slide which publishes

940
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,180
all the links and the

941
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,020
topology of the design that reference

942
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,400
implementation

943
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,740
so that's there when you have interested

944
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,200
you can always download it and check

945
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,900
where this repositories are and what is

946
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,880
being committed to them

947
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,760
and what's why it contains uh

948
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,819
image from the the hackathon and it's

949
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:29,700
named the end so this just uh

950
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,460
picture of the table of the setup and

951
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,599
the

952
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,260
the main screen in London

953
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,980
so that's that's the presentation

954
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,540
very good

955
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,240
well thanks for that update uh and

956
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,000
thanks for continuing to pursue this

957
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,560
um you know simultaneously with running

958
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,380
code and uh in the context of the

959
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,060
hackathons

960
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,400
um did you have any interest uh any

961
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,560
folks uh asking questions at the

962
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,180
hackathon uh Vladimir

963
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,300
not much not much interest in during the

964
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,420
the hackathon and

965
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,980
especially this one I mean

966
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,079
I just have to be honest it was very

967
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,020
little like a course domain cooperation

968
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,980
in on our table

969
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,760
so

970
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,760
I I have had some success with the

971
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,240
people interested on other like uh

972
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,240
venues like fpga conference here in

973
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,460
Norway

974
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,339
and so I'm trying to find from three

975
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,500
different areas people that are inside

976
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,579
like the networking worlds in ITF the

977
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,420
the network the the test world is a

978
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,700
different like segment which also is

979
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,160
interested in this kind of models and

980
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,740
devices but they they don't seem to have

981
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,140
the background for young yet

982
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,800
and the fpga will is also like another

983
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,980
community that has a stake in this work

984
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,800
so it's like uh I'm trying to figure out

985
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,859
how to to

986
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:10,200
involve people and create interest but

987
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,260
um yeah particularly in the the London

988
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,740
we didn't manage to get any any kind of

989
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,079
interesting connections

990
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,280
yeah okay well um I'm sorry about that

991
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,260
but uh

992
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,380
well I'm hoping for uh looking for more

993
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,319
interest uh course in the future well

994
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,480
when I say that there were people

995
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,180
reading the the material and the

996
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,300
checking the implementation so

997
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,200
maybe this like comes later on

998
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,420
I I don't know

999
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,460
maybe some maybe some

1000
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,880
I will say okay thank you

1001
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,180
good thanks a lot any questions about

1002
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,598
Vladimir's presentation

1003
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,400
I don't see any requests for the four

1004
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,380
but I do see it

1005
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,940
oh okay

1006
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,800
oh man

1007
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,800
screen share did you guys see the slides

1008
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,520
I was presenting

1009
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,339
hello

1010
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,859
did you guys see

1011
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:34,220
Vladimir's slides

1012
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,460
in the room I'm doing Stephen

1013
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,319
so you couldn't see him in the room

1014
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,160
so when I'm sharing

1015
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,480
when I'm sharing the screen

1016
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,560
right now I'm sharing the

1017
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,740
uh the note taking screen

1018
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,020
can you guys see that

1019
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,780
yes yes I can see it

1020
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,260
okay

1021
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,339
all right so I don't know what went

1022
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,660
wrong last time

1023
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,040
but um I'm going to stop sharing this

1024
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,319
and uh I'm gonna try this again with uh

1025
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,599
with the gabor's slides

1026
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,359
so hang on a second because I don't see

1027
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,140
yeah I still don't see uh the board

1028
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,260
slides and the decks ready to be shared

1029
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,119
so I don't know why that's being held up

1030
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,920
there seems to be some

1031
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,180
uh-huh some some really long delay there

1032
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:55,759
but if I if I share my screen

1033
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,780
and I share screen too

1034
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,000
then now you guys should see a version

1035
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,560
of the uh

1036
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,880
you know the bmwg meteco page uh that

1037
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,099
converges on infinite Infinity

1038
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:14,040
uh would somebody confirm that

1039
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,319
I can see it I can see it

1040
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,060
okay good thanks

1041
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,660
and then uh if I if I bring up a slide

1042
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,160
deck here

1043
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,260
or Gabor

1044
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,460
which is basically

1045
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,740
uh this one uh can you guys in the room

1046
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,060
see this

1047
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,800
yes

1048
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,660
okay

1049
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,780
so I'm I apologize if people can see the

1050
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,300
slide deck last time I did exactly the

1051
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,500
same steps

1052
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,440
and uh Gabor

1053
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,440
um let's go ahead and work your way

1054
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,319
through these uh try to take about no

1055
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,420
more than 15 minutes okay

1056
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,220
okay

1057
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,400
uh can you uh set the the slideshow full

1058
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,440
screen

1059
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,880
I don't know I'm not sure

1060
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,140
yeah there we go yeah it's much better

1061
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,660
yes it's much better nice full skin

1062
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,140
thank you thank you so uh our draft is

1063
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,240
about the benchmarking methodology for a

1064
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,420
stateful n80 XY gate phase using RFC

1065
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,480
4814 it's a random port numbers could

1066
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,440
you go to the next slide

1067
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,280
that's that's right thank you so in my

1068
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,099
slide we just try to summarize the aim

1069
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,240
of our draft

1070
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,000
so our aim is to achieve some

1071
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,819
reproducible stateful and hdx5

1072
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:49,740
performance measurements producing

1073
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,980
meaningful results and to that end we

1074
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,559
want to facilitate to carry out the

1075
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,000
measurement procedures of old old

1076
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,240
bmwg benchmarking rfcs like

1077
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,680
2544 5180 and 8219 and all the

1078
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,780
measurement procedures they defined for

1079
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,119
throughput latency Frameworks lead Etc

1080
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,839
to Benchmark stateful nadx fly gateways

1081
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:20,099
uh without some careful

1082
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:23,760
thing it's not possible especially if we

1083
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,960
would like to also comply with RFC 4814

1084
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,559
several import numbers uh using them

1085
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:35,220
because uh through the estate gateways

1086
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,880
you cannot just send through packets

1087
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,339
with any random port numbers

1088
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:44,240
so we had to reconcile the two

1089
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,760
requirements and we also added some some

1090
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,500
new performance metrics for typically

1091
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,960
stateful

1092
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,460
benchmarking such as maximum connection

1093
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,500
establishment rate measurement and

1094
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,420
connection tear down rate and connection

1095
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,760
Training Table capacity could you go to

1096
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,300
the next slide

1097
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,000
thank you so the progress of our draft

1098
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,059
I'm very happy that during summer at

1099
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:16,260
iitf 114 our draft has been adapted by

1100
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,579
the working group thank you very much

1101
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:20,520
for everybody for the support and since

1102
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,760
then we submitted two versions version

1103
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,319
zero was uh just a little update we

1104
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,700
added stateful nadxy asset with n864

1105
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,099
Gateway as an example because previously

1106
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,680
only states were nt4 Gateway was on the

1107
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,700
game so and the same as an example and

1108
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,960
we did some conditional checking and

1109
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,839
Corrections and in the next version the

1110
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,540
current version we added some more we

1111
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,819
added some measurement recommended some

1112
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:52,859
measurements for scalability agents the

1113
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:54,660
number of connections and agent number

1114
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,680
of CPU cores and we also added a

1115
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,359
recommended reporting format could you

1116
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:03,078
go to the next slide

1117
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,440
thank you so this is the the slide which

1118
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,140
contains which we added this set for

1119
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,720
nt64 of course our methodology works

1120
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,300
with any IP version but uh it was an

1121
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,839
idea that not only net four four but six

1122
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,300
four should be uh displayed as an

1123
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,480
example so just a quick reminder we have

1124
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,920
two devices the test and the device

1125
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,559
under a test which is now the stateful

1126
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,400
nat64 Gateway and as I said before you

1127
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,160
cannot send just a package through this

1128
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,300
Gateway

1129
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,180
uh and initiate and connections can be

1130
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,400
initiated only from the IP version 6

1131
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,160
slide side so the this is on the left

1132
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,859
side of the figure so this is why the

1133
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:49,740
Port of the left of side of the tester

1134
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,900
is called initiator because it can

1135
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,960
Ascend any

1136
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,720
frames and then the states will indexed

1137
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,700
by Gateway translates the frame and

1138
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,319
Records

1139
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:04,020
a connection tracking table entry and

1140
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,660
forwards it back to the responder Port

1141
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,660
which collects a source IP address

1142
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,579
destination IP address Source port

1143
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,160
number destination port number

1144
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,140
information is Affordable into a state

1145
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,720
stable and then after that of course

1146
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,420
exchanging source and destination it can

1147
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,819
send back

1148
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,020
buried

1149
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,559
valid frames very test frames which the

1150
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,200
state when he gets but it's like a six

1151
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,940
four Gateway will be able to forward

1152
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,619
when you go to the next slide

1153
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,540
thank you

1154
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,859
so uh the basic idea is that we defined

1155
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:46,440
a primary test phase which serves two

1156
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,079
purposes during this permanent test

1157
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,000
phase the connection downtable of the

1158
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,859
device and the test is field and the

1159
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:54,420
state table of the responders field

1160
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,880
without its four tappers so after that

1161
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,760
you can do a real test phase in which

1162
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,520
you can execute any of the classic

1163
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,260
measurement procedures like super

1164
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,160
frameless rate latency Etc and in

1165
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,680
addition to that this Premier test phase

1166
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,740
can be used alone as a measurement phase

1167
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,599
for maximum connection establishment

1168
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,460
rate would you go to the next slide

1169
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,000
thank you no it's this is the new

1170
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,140
materia

1171
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,720
oh yes okay this is one more reminder

1172
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,780
slide yes to support repeatable

1173
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,640
measurements uh we we can

1174
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,920
achieve to extreme situations which can

1175
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,559
be uh simply ensured

1176
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,599
the first one is when all test frames

1177
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,220
create a new connection

1178
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,200
this is ideal for measuring maximum

1179
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,300
connection is that measurement rate and

1180
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,579
the other same situation when test

1181
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,020
strains never create a new connection

1182
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,540
this idea for the classic test like

1183
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,420
throughput framework latency Etc

1184
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,000
and the conditions to achieve then is

1185
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,160
that we should start each Elementary

1186
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,559
test with a large enough and empty

1187
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,319
connection tracking table and we should

1188
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,420
slow down normally enumerate all

1189
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,640
possible port number destination import

1190
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,200
Source Port analysis report number

1191
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,599
combinations in the primary phase and we

1192
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,579
should set the timeout in the device

1193
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,819
under test properly High to be higher

1194
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:21,980
than the

1195
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,420
the gap between the two phases and the

1196
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,160
real test phase

1197
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,200
and if you do connection until double

1198
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,319
testing then it's even higher than the

1199
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:34,500
additional phase 14 down the connections

1200
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,819
please go to the next slide

1201
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:46,339
yes and uh there was something in ISC

1202
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:51,240
8219 in section 10 that it mentioned a

1203
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,819
test with several Network flows although

1204
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:56,160
it didn't specify exactly how to create

1205
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,619
server Network flows for example using

1206
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:00,599
multiple Source IPL the series multiple

1207
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,760
destination IP addresses or multiple

1208
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,500
Source sport numbers or destination port

1209
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,960
numbers in our draft earlier we

1210
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,900
recommended to use only a single Source

1211
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,980
IP destination IP address pair and using

1212
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,040
a fixed and larger Source port number

1213
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,319
rage for range for example in the order

1214
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:23,280
of 10 000 and we should use a variable

1215
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,559
size destination port number range it

1216
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:29,400
can be as small as 10 or 100 or it can

1217
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,339
be larger and by changing the size of

1218
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:35,220
this range we can generate the required

1219
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:39,240
number of network flows and of course if

1220
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,280
it depends technology depends on the

1221
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,160
purpose so if we would like to uh cover

1222
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,319
a wide range with a low number of

1223
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,260
measurements we can increase tenfold or

1224
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,180
if we would like to make a fine gain

1225
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,640
analysis we can just double the number

1226
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,280
of the size of the number of destination

1227
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,680
Point numbers so then we can do a lot of

1228
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,000
measurements

1229
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,020
next slide please

1230
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,299
yes and this is something maybe unusual

1231
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:13,079
but I will say uh but it's it's really

1232
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:16,920
real the reality in a stateful nit six

1233
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,619
four gateways that they are many times

1234
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:22,260
implemented in software so you don't buy

1235
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,960
a device this is a device but you

1236
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,180
download the software many times three

1237
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,180
software and you just install it and set

1238
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,900
it up and use it for example

1239
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,500
which I use this Joule or it's a bit

1240
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,359
slow but it can be also used tiger plus

1241
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,640
IP tables because Target is a state last

1242
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,240
one and it needs a stateful

1243
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,059
counterpart and also I use open BSD PF

1244
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,700
and

1245
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,640
fdiobp also implements uh Salesforce

1246
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,260
n864

1247
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,440
so many times we use a software for

1248
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,099
State 4980xy implementation however our

1249
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,839
typical view was released

1250
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,240
I would say in my name is it my typical

1251
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,760
view is that we have a tester and a

1252
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,079
device under test I was talking about

1253
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,180
that a few minutes ago

1254
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,480
but in this case we're not testing a

1255
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,280
device because the software is not bound

1256
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,680
to a specific Hardware so but it's not

1257
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,059
really useful that we can know that we

1258
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:27,240
have a given implementation using a

1259
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,720
given server and we measure something in

1260
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,640
that case we don't know about how it

1261
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,980
would perform in a different server so

1262
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,579
what is more useful for us in this case

1263
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:41,040
perhaps the performance of a given

1264
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,260
implementation using a single core of a

1265
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,200
random CPU and even more debt the scale

1266
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,480
up of the perform performance of a given

1267
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,880
implementation with the number of CPU

1268
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,460
cores an efficient solution can be that

1269
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,180
we use powers of two as active core

1270
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:01,980
numbers so 1 2 4 8 Etc

1271
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,619
in this case with a few measurements we

1272
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,200
can cover a wide range of number of CPU

1273
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,460
cores

1274
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,420
next slide please

1275
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,660
yes and one more thing which was missing

1276
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,760
from our draft and it is present in

1277
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,040
several other drafts that we should

1278
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,980
specify reporting format of course the

1279
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,079
very first thing is that measurements

1280
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,299
must be executed multiple times and the

1281
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:29,940
number of measurements uh must be

1282
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,460
included in the report

1283
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,520
and if we have multiple results then we

1284
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,740
need to use some summarizing function we

1285
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,540
recommend median the summarizing

1286
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,859
function because it is less

1287
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:47,099
less dependent on on outliers less

1288
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:49,980
sensitive to outliners than average

1289
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,760
and of course we are also interested in

1290
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,740
the dispersion of the results so first

1291
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,500
person time 99 percentile can be used as

1292
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,900
an initial study dispersion

1293
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,760
and of course it's very important that

1294
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,220
all parameters and settings that may

1295
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,780
influence the performance of the device

1296
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,020
under test must be reported in the

1297
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:14,720
results report and it is also some cases

1298
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,880
there are some implementation specific

1299
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,760
parameters for example hash table size

1300
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,359
and connection table size for IP tables

1301
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,000
which don't exist for other

1302
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,440
implementations so these things also

1303
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,480
must be reported another example was

1304
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,359
here is the number of limits for open

1305
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,579
BSD and okay it's good thank you thank

1306
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:37,859
you you did very well to go to next okay

1307
01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:41,520
thank you and here's a reporting format

1308
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,520
so there are some required quantities

1309
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,640
for example in this example table we

1310
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,200
measure the maximum connectional

1311
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,780
statement rate of Ip tables H and the

1312
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,260
number of sessions so of course uh as an

1313
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,119
independent variable we must have the

1314
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,400
number of sessions which are not just

1315
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,579
random but the product of source number

1316
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,260
Source port number and destination port

1317
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,780
numbers and here there's two examples

1318
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,640
for the hash sites and connection taking

1319
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,040
table size which are specific to IP

1320
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,119
tables

1321
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:15,780
and here's one very important calculated

1322
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,579
value which is the number of sessions

1323
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:19,380
per hash size

1324
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,500
it means that the implementation of Ip

1325
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,660
tables has a hash table and from each

1326
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,000
entry of the hash table a linked list is

1327
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,960
started and these numbers is 3.05 and

1328
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,640
3.81

1329
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,359
Etc these are the average length of

1330
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:39,420
these lists which is very important it

1331
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,579
it really determines the performance of

1332
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:43,380
Ip tables

1333
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,440
and of course the number of experiments

1334
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,900
and the error of the binary search the

1335
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,460
difference between the lower and upper

1336
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,520
bound and here come the real result of

1337
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,280
course the com the measured connection

1338
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,980
between lead the median and the first

1339
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,680
and 99th percentiles

1340
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,940
go to next slide please

1341
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,480
yes and for discussion we put some

1342
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,319
slides for for discussion

1343
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,540
still for generating multiple Network

1344
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,900
flows we proposed to use only a singular

1345
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,700
Source IP address and destination as a

1346
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,960
spare and multiple port numbers

1347
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,720
and currently I'm in Tokyo and do

1348
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,000
measurements with the before mentioned

1349
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,460
implementations Joule tiger plus IP

1350
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:36,180
tables and open bsdpf and I found that

1351
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,280
this solution works properly with Linux

1352
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,920
because

1353
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,940
the servers which I use the support

1354
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,640
this is size scaling so if I set

1355
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,579
properly the NSS function then not only

1356
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:52,680
the IP addresses but also the port

1357
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,260
numbers take part in the in the hash

1358
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,660
function and I can distribute the

1359
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,880
interrupts of the packet arrivals among

1360
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,819
the CPU cores so all CPU cores take part

1361
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,940
in processing the interlaps however it's

1362
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,540
not the case with openbsd so I I just

1363
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,880
checked with the top command and I saw

1364
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,859
that as I used the direction of traffic

1365
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:16,920
two two cores were working to process

1366
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,079
the interrupts and the other course were

1367
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:21,780
not working because they were only one

1368
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,880
ipages there and in the other direction

1369
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,180
they were exchanged but the source port

1370
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,740
number extension polynomial didn't have

1371
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,740
to to

1372
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,180
disable the interrupts among the CPU

1373
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,260
cores

1374
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:37,079
but of course it's not the case if if

1375
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,920
this device forwards internal traffic so

1376
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,440
maybe we could improve in the situation

1377
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,880
could you go to the next slide please

1378
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,780
so our question is that we should add

1379
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,079
the requirement of using multiple IP

1380
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:57,420
addresses

1381
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,059
because in that case the measurement

1382
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:02,880
results would be closer to those that

1383
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,720
one could experience when the Gateway

1384
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,000
processes internet traffic

1385
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,619
and we have just one more slide

1386
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,440
please go to the next slide

1387
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,460
and I was talking about scalability and

1388
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,140
the recommended scalability internet

1389
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,500
number of network flows be used for this

1390
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,680
uh the the variable size destination for

1391
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,980
number range to set different numbers

1392
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,900
Network flows and we recommend the

1393
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,780
descability agent the CPU core numbers

1394
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:41,280
the active CPU core numbers and I think

1395
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,400
both are important but our question is

1396
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,380
that is there any other type of

1397
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,480
scalability what would be important to

1398
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,680
examine

1399
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,900
so we have these questions and we would

1400
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,599
like to get feedback from you thank you

1401
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,960
very much

1402
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:02,760
okay uh thanks very much Gabor

1403
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,099
um on your on your last couple of topics

1404
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:08,460
uh any input from the folks in

1405
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,880
attendance

1406
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:15,839
now each other if possible I have a

1407
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,760
comment about scalability what test

1408
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,339
because I had some experience many years

1409
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:22,920
ago about about to test primarily

1410
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,960
firewalls but not just firewalls any

1411
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,579
stateful device has typically four

1412
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,680
limits four limits and four limits was

1413
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,440
tested by me many times in the past the

1414
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,099
one limit is a number of flow uh the top

1415
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:37,140
number of law which particular device is

1416
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,859
capable to handle uh it's more or less

1417
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:42,240
just one number it's static number it's

1418
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,760
just top top number which possible to

1419
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,380
squeeze in in the Box

1420
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,200
but additionally to this uh it was as

1421
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,140
usual

1422
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,880
mandatory to test such things like GPS

1423
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,680
gigabits per second

1424
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,240
uh PPS buckets per second and CPS

1425
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,859
sessions per second new sessions per

1426
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:03,960
second it's typically was four

1427
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,339
parameters and for static table how many

1428
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:10,380
flows devices capable to handle it was

1429
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,240
just one number which is easy to test

1430
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,059
its separate test but for combination of

1431
01:08:15,059 --> 01:08:19,920
CPS PPS and gbps it was always a mix the

1432
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,679
more gbps you will request from the box

1433
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:26,460
the last PPS and CPS you will get the

1434
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,620
more CPA CPS you will ask the less

1435
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,540
therefore it was always the combination

1436
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,060
it was typically the combination has

1437
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,620
been decided by looking to the real

1438
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,380
customer production traffic you look to

1439
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,380
any customer box decide what is the real

1440
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,859
situation between GPS

1441
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:46,319
mpps and new sessions per second decide

1442
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,060
what is a mix what is a typical

1443
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,698
situation for the customer and then to

1444
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:53,580
test this one and how to do it in

1445
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,620
Benchmark in case I don't understand

1446
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:57,920
assistant

1447
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:04,399
okay let me also share my my experience

1448
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:07,679
so I completely agree that usually

1449
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,779
there's some upper limits for the number

1450
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:12,719
of sessions for IP tables we could

1451
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,020
exactly measure it and of course we knew

1452
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,299
it in advance that we sat for the

1453
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,399
maximum number of connections and you

1454
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,520
could measure it very accurately but as

1455
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,640
for Joule we were not able to measure it

1456
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,679
because it seems that it doesn't have a

1457
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:31,439
real limit the limit is the amount of

1458
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,339
memory

1459
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:35,520
so when we just increased increased

1460
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,339
increased finally uh the the computer

1461
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:41,359
stops working

1462
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,799
I don't know how it is implemented but

1463
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:46,500
it can uh just trash the data fracture

1464
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,899
until it has done free memory and then

1465
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:51,960
it changes you're right with this

1466
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,520
comment because you typically test

1467
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,560
software box I have in the past

1468
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,600
experience to test Hardware box and for

1469
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,820
Hardware box there was a limit of course

1470
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,920
it was primarily memory based as you

1471
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,260
said but it was uh pretty much a limit

1472
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,660
and sometimes it was a limit really for

1473
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,640
production maybe you're right maybe for

1474
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,960
your case because you test something

1475
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,060
software based and it's just a memory

1476
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,940
maybe in your case the overall number of

1477
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,040
sessions which is capable to squeeze

1478
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,660
maybe it's not important maybe you're

1479
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,600
right maybe not I'm not sure about this

1480
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,840
but for combination of CPS BPS and gbps

1481
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,940
I believe you will have exactly the same

1482
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,820
problem the more GPS you have the less

1483
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,880
PPS you have Etc this mix would be still

1484
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,580
still a mix

1485
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,580
yes I I totally agree with you but what

1486
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,420
I experienced it was the same uh but uh

1487
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,280
to some extent I had experienced

1488
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,159
something different because if if I use

1489
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:51,120
uh fast enough uh network interfaces

1490
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,179
currently I use 10 gigabit interfaces up

1491
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:58,380
to a while uh it's the the number of uh

1492
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,800
packets per second is not not I don't

1493
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,300
even say independent but nearly

1494
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,580
independent from the packet size so if I

1495
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:11,159
use 82 bytes or uh 128 bytes or 256

1496
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:13,679
bytes the package rate that you've maxed

1497
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,900
in fact is very similar because the

1498
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,780
bottleneck is usually in our case in my

1499
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,300
my measurements is the is the handling

1500
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,980
of the packets and not not the

1501
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,120
transmission through the network

1502
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,840
interface

1503
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,360
based Solutions of course if I use tiger

1504
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,659
which is a user space solution then the

1505
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,219
copying between the user and Canon space

1506
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:41,400
may may make slower if I use a bigger

1507
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,420
bigger frame size

1508
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:48,540
but but I I experience the same but you

1509
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,300
said that if I use many sessions then

1510
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,600
all the others will deteriorate

1511
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,880
yeah but but for sure but for sure but

1512
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,920
for sure even for your software-based

1513
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,440
situation uh you will still should have

1514
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,020
a big dependency between uh packet per

1515
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,239
second and new sessions per second this

1516
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,800
particular dependency should be still

1517
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,960
pretty much big

1518
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,800
yes I I measure separately uh the

1519
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,360
maximum connection establishment rate

1520
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,199
and then if I have a given number of

1521
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,120
connections then with a given of number

1522
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,860
of connections I can do the throughput

1523
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,719
rate and by I do the throughput

1524
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,880
measurement uh I I just separated it

1525
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,760
because uh the first I test the number

1526
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,920
of connections per second the maximum

1527
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,800
and then with no new connections I

1528
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,080
measure the throughput and other latency

1529
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,480
other things and don't mix the two so if

1530
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,940
I try to make the two it will be maybe

1531
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,159
more realistic your completely right but

1532
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,500
then it will be very hard to to measure

1533
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,179
it in a in a reputable way

1534
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,440
right

1535
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,179
um we've got a couple of other requests

1536
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:57,480
for the floor here guys so uh let me uh

1537
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,840
let me recognize uh Vladimir go ahead go

1538
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,020
ahead

1539
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,219
we can hear you Vladimir

1540
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:22,759
all right how about masiak

1541
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,699
hear me there's no question

1542
01:13:28,699 --> 01:13:32,699
yeah I do um thanks very much for

1543
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:36,540
a very informative uh uh talk I have a a

1544
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,520
comment about the scalability

1545
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,040
specifically number of CPU cores um I

1546
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,080
noticed that

1547
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,840
um the way you're assuming uh the the

1548
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,940
flows are load balanced across the

1549
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,980
course is using RSS

1550
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:53,940
as we are dealing here with uh not uh

1551
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:57,840
not uh for 4046 stateful flows with the

1552
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,400
distinction between the forward and

1553
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,659
return flows

1554
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:03,840
in the forward and return flows are

1555
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,320
are different uh from the you know our

1556
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:10,380
from the RSS hashing perspective I.E

1557
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,600
they will have a different

1558
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:18,179
um uh uh different uh uh uh IP header uh

1559
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:20,100
values IP addresses

1560
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:24,000
um if it's a source not and um and and

1561
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,679
also ports

1562
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,460
so if you scale number of CPU cores it

1563
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,860
is likely that the forward and return

1564
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,500
flows will end up on different CPU cores

1565
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,560
so the more cores you have the more work

1566
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,300
the threats running on those scores will

1567
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,040
have to do to

1568
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,560
um reconciliate the the state or share

1569
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,760
the state

1570
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,679
so that's that's one thing maybe to

1571
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:49,560
consider uh in terms of evaluating the

1572
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,420
multi-core scalability

1573
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:55,500
on how to scale the uh the the dot the

1574
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,500
software dot across multiple cores and

1575
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,199
there are solutions

1576
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,420
um out there that

1577
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,840
um you may consider that uh scale the

1578
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,900
course by running independent software

1579
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,540
instances and and basically load

1580
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,280
balancing across them from the original

1581
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,219
flows but but that's just one one aspect

1582
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:19,320
to take into account on how the forward

1583
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,500
and return flows are all balanced using

1584
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,100
RSS

1585
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,440
for raising that comment

1586
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,540
um our Gabor I'm gonna have to cut this

1587
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:33,300
discussion off unfortunately at this

1588
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,159
point uh we've got a lot of other

1589
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:38,760
presentations to cover and uh so let's

1590
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,980
uh let's move along thank you very much

1591
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:44,599
for your work on this Gabor

1592
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,159
all right

1593
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:50,839
so let's see here uh

1594
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,679
so I've got I've got a set of slides I

1595
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,260
can share here on the considerations for

1596
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:01,260
benchmarking uh in the containerized

1597
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:04,739
infrastructure and I think it's a Min

1598
01:16:04,739 --> 01:16:06,840
nut Trend who's going to be presenting

1599
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,500
is that correct

1600
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,380
you hear me

1601
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:17,219
can you hear me yes yes I can so let's

1602
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:20,280
um let's try to uh let's try to make

1603
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,679
this uh 10 minutes please

1604
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:27,000
okay I'll start a timer for you

1605
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,800
okay so hello everyone

1606
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,600
um

1607
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,679
CC

1608
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,380
Oria so on behalf of my authors I've

1609
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,320
been present a drop update today

1610
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,400
next slide please

1611
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,560
so the first thing we update in this

1612
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,739
drive is we are police our draft and

1613
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:48,800
reorganize the content inside our draft

1614
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,199
to clearly show the purpose of the drive

1615
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:54,600
so the dropper post is provide

1616
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,640
additional considerations as

1617
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,620
specification to guide copyright

1618
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,140
infrastructure batch marking to compare

1619
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,580
with previous benchmarking methodology

1620
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,960
for NF infrastructures so we reorganized

1621
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,420
the drug in the way that we clearly show

1622
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,520
really for additional consideration

1623
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,040
there's a additional deployment

1624
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,260
scenarios additional configuration

1625
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,199
parameters then the two investigation of

1626
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,239
different Continental networking models

1627
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,460
based on the uses of this switch and

1628
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,260
different package assertion techniques

1629
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,600
and investigation of different

1630
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,739
deployment settings

1631
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,239
make performance impacts on the network

1632
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:34,560
performance

1633
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,580
next slide please

1634
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,739
so this is a the comparison between our

1635
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:45,900
previous track and the current version

1636
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,120
so to increase the drop cohesion and

1637
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,280
clearly show the purple water draft we

1638
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,219
have add a new section it's a graphic

1639
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:56,159
benchmarking consideration so by looking

1640
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:59,280
at the current version everyone look at

1641
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,920
our graphic and clearly see what is the

1642
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,020
additional consideration for cutting

1643
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,760
effect infrastructures so and inside

1644
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,000
that say in the four consideration the

1645
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,640
department scenarios is actually taken

1646
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,520
from the previous season 3 The overview

1647
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,159
of controlled infrastructures so by

1648
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,679
moving the easy into this one the

1649
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,199
department scenario addition one can be

1650
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:26,040
cohesive then we add a new completely

1651
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,080
new additional configuration parameters

1652
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,840
then we have a networking models the

1653
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,060
previous season 4 and exactly when we

1654
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:35,520
update the ebpf is as a model with the

1655
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,300
AF pdb deployment option and uh the

1656
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,120
previous 1655 impacts a move inside this

1657
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,780
as well as the consideration number four

1658
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,800
next slide please

1659
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,340
so this is a detailed update so the

1660
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:56,159
first managing consideration is action

1661
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,900
deployment scenario

1662
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,020
it actually move from the previously the

1663
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,340
overview one

1664
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:04,199
it's nothing new here

1665
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:05,159
because

1666
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:08,059
next type is

1667
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:15,179
this is a new session the additional

1668
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:17,520
configuration parameter and it's just a

1669
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,679
list of additional parameters that need

1670
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,360
to be considered when I've been smoking

1671
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,600
cartilage networking so they are the

1672
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,760
resulted container printer selected

1673
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,400
container level plugin selected package

1674
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,760
access napping model number of CVN app

1675
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,900
and the restock allocation to the cbnl

1676
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,860
inside this

1677
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,940
for the third benchmarking consideration

1678
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,540
this is the networking models so we

1679
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:51,960
update the evpf assets model with af's

1680
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,480
ATP Department option so previously

1681
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,699
inside the previous club we only

1682
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:59,219
mentioned about the channel listing

1683
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:01,440
package between the

1684
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,739
Big Driver and the user space using EPF

1685
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:08,219
in the hook only so there are another

1686
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:10,500
development option that is using a ADB

1687
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,620
socket is a new liner socket that allows

1688
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:17,100
bypass control part and this option is

1689
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:21,000
used by support afpb switch like OBS or

1690
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,820
VPP and it's also used by the Intel

1691
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,699
connected data plane and the second

1692
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:28,860
development option for evf acceleration

1693
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,620
is using the EPA program branding inside

1694
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,900
the traffic control and the ACP Hub

1695
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,420
inside the net driver

1696
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,500
next time please

1697
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:44,159
uh the last consideration inside the

1698
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,860
inside the Trap is performing it past if

1699
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,780
we make no change we just move it inside

1700
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,159
this section

1701
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:53,120
please try please

1702
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:57,239
so in our preview has got home in 104

1703
01:20:57,239 --> 01:21:01,800
and 105 we are masking

1704
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,480
effort for EPF acceleration models so we

1705
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:09,719
verified the EPF acceleration with four

1706
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:10,920
validation

1707
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,179
first is using ovs V switch with the

1708
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:18,480
vhost users as a

1709
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,640
connection between the user space and

1710
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,780
the port

1711
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:25,020
the second variation is using the vpb

1712
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:28,679
switch this one using the memory instead

1713
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:31,260
of the vehicles users and both CV switch

1714
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,920
use is afdb Support Division it means

1715
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,900
that is to have an alepp remote driver

1716
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,320
to get the package from the EPF program

1717
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,060
button inside the driver

1718
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,540
and 12 valuation is a

1719
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,760
ETL quantity data plane is a new project

1720
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,640
that they have their own kubernetes

1721
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,659
plugin and this company plugins that can

1722
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,000
move the network device from the hot

1723
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,239
mechanism spray and directly attack it

1724
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,820
into the port Network namespace so the

1725
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,400
port can get the package from the ADP

1726
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,560
socket and the final will be the serum

1727
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,120
cni

1728
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,199
next type is

1729
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:18,480
so we have the results and we had a

1730
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,580
total result with the zero packet

1731
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,719
percent loss

1732
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,940
so what we can see from this result is

1733
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,900
that the first thing here vvp if sdp

1734
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:30,120
performed okay sdp because of the memory

1735
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,300
support comparison with the vfvs the

1736
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,340
second is that the user space V switch

1737
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,159
using f80p promo fiber can achieve

1738
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,679
similar performance versus the one using

1739
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:43,860
the dtk promo driver and about the new

1740
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:47,520
Intel CI cndp with your property from

1741
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,280
afdb socket to support by moving wd5

1742
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,580
from my hostname hotness way to bonding

1743
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,340
display it can catch up the LGB

1744
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,040
performance with like a side package

1745
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,380
this side please

1746
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,719
um quick question on this uh how many

1747
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:07,800
flowers are in use for this test

1748
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,640
uh

1749
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,600
yeah

1750
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,239
about the flow is is it wonderful yeah

1751
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:17,959
how many flows

1752
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,460
is it just one or um

1753
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:27,360
multiple photos okay

1754
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,179
okay

1755
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:33,020
good thanks

1756
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,580
for the psyllium the ability of cerium

1757
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,380
to accelerate performance have already

1758
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,840
been banned much by itself and probably

1759
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,140
in uh some of their report so serum can

1760
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,719
fall can accelerate both no cell and

1761
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,040
Israel

1762
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,960
to compare with the

1763
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,900
other values and then Elysium can

1764
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:58,679
can if you like EPF for Eastway traffic

1765
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:02,219
with other various in the uh the Easter

1766
01:24:02,219 --> 01:24:04,080
traffic accuracy

1767
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,980
accomplished by the district itself

1768
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:10,940
next slide please

1769
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:16,500
so and we think that the idea one of

1770
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,239
hacker Thomas completes our

1771
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:21,120
investigation activities for all the

1772
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,940
proper landmark in Constitution Etc so

1773
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,100
we would like to hear any question and

1774
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,199
comment from anyone in the working

1775
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:31,199
groups that be interested in our job and

1776
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,120
we really want these kind of feedback

1777
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,480
for the WG adoption as the next type of

1778
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,239
digital drug thank you

1779
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:43,800
that's great thanks very much so

1780
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,280
um look one thing I'm going to ask is

1781
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,080
that uh you know we've got a couple of

1782
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,679
authors of the um multiple loss ratio

1783
01:24:52,679 --> 01:24:56,100
search uh working in uh very heavily

1784
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,219
with virtualized uh measurements and uh

1785
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,980
you know the virtualization technology I

1786
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,360
think it would really be really good if

1787
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,000
mossiak and Bradco uh could take a look

1788
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,820
at this and make some suggestions

1789
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,600
um do you uh uh do you guys agree masiak

1790
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,140
and vodka

1791
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:18,600
I agree

1792
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,080
good

1793
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:24,600
I I haven't got your audio out

1794
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,880
um I get I only heard are you calling

1795
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,699
out us mlr search authors I guess you're

1796
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:31,920
asking for review I'm the Audio I got

1797
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,840
wasn't legible

1798
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,840
sorry about that yeah I'm asking uh I'm

1799
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,900
tagging you guys uh uh for uh review

1800
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,420
specifically since you're working in you

1801
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,719
know an area very close to this please

1802
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:50,219
sure thank you that's great and um I'm

1803
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:53,040
I'm searching to try to get some uh

1804
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,699
review from the um uh the Anakin oil

1805
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:59,340
open source project uh where we're still

1806
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,040
we still have a bench parking uh project

1807
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,320
there hopefully I'll get some feedback

1808
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,400
for you there as well

1809
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,940
thank you

1810
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:12,960
okay well thanks very much for the um uh

1811
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,639
for the quick review here today much

1812
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,199
appreciated

1813
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:20,820
all right so then moving right along uh

1814
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:23,940
we got a couple of talks on uh us uh the

1815
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:27,420
you know the uh segment routing and

1816
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,000
we'll start out with um uh we'll start

1817
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,620
out with the mpls

1818
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:34,020
uh segment routing

1819
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,679
and uh Apollo I think that's you right

1820
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,020
that's right just checking you can hear

1821
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,540
me properly remotely

1822
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:46,280
yes good

1823
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:52,440
well it's interesting I'm the first

1824
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,699
Speaker physically in the room

1825
01:26:55,699 --> 01:26:59,520
yeah well okay I'm very glad you joined

1826
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,080
us in person

1827
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,960
right so just to introduce myself Paul

1828
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,900
volpato away and speaking on behalf of

1829
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,320
the hotels you see listed here and uh

1830
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,800
this is the first of uh two drafts we

1831
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,440
have submitted to Benchmark segment

1832
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,040
routine capable devices uh specifically

1833
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,639
this rap is about Sr mbrs and there will

1834
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:26,100
be the next talk provided by eduarda on

1835
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,639
srv6 just as the next presentation next

1836
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:31,139
slide please

1837
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:33,900
and uh by the way Paul I'm going to give

1838
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,300
you uh gonna give you 10 minutes here as

1839
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,020
well

1840
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,540
sure which I'm starting now I think wait

1841
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,560
a minute

1842
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,940
start

1843
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,100
thank you okay I'll try to be even

1844
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:47,480
quicker than that yeah

1845
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:50,880
that'll help our later presenters please

1846
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,080
God

1847
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,120
okay so

1848
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,400
um I think this is uh something already

1849
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,159
known but just to share a few details uh

1850
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:02,900
segment routing as defined by RFC 8402

1851
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:07,080
can be applied to two different uh data

1852
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,620
planes uh as said that these draft

1853
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:14,280
focuses on SR mpls

1854
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,320
um let's see that our starting point is

1855
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,920
RFC 5695 which describes the methodology

1856
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,420
for benchmarking mpls devices so that is

1857
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:27,780
I would say our foundational uh

1858
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:32,179
component uh what we did is actually to

1859
01:28:32,179 --> 01:28:35,780
uh use it as the basis and complement

1860
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:38,520
that paper as well as all the references

1861
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,199
that you see this study here in the

1862
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:43,219
draft to extend the capability to

1863
01:28:43,219 --> 01:28:46,199
Benchmark srmpls we just need something

1864
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:50,580
more than the basic mpls benchmarking

1865
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,840
methodology

1866
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,580
so that's why we have submitted this

1867
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,560
draft

1868
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,340
next slide please

1869
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:03,060
okay as I said uh

1870
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:06,480
the SR policy the SR mpls police to be

1871
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:10,500
more precise uh is instantiated on the

1872
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,699
packet as a set of labels so basically

1873
01:29:13,699 --> 01:29:16,739
you define a segment list which is a set

1874
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:19,620
of labels you impose to the uh to the

1875
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,940
packet

1876
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,860
um there is a sort of one-to-one

1877
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,659
Correspondence between segment rooting

1878
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,659
mpls and mpls itself there are three

1879
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:31,320
basic operations considering srps we

1880
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,020
have the push operation basically you

1881
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:37,800
inject a policy I will say on top of a

1882
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,020
packet that corresponds to the label

1883
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:43,500
push in the mpls terminology

1884
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,260
uh there is the next operation which

1885
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,300
corresponds to the label pop in the

1886
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,840
traditional mpls jargon so the

1887
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,000
um the label the policy the topmost

1888
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,580
policy is removed and then you do

1889
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,199
something which is correspond to the

1890
01:29:58,199 --> 01:30:01,860
next operation that you are instructed

1891
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,600
to do and then we have the third

1892
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,520
operation which is continue basically

1893
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,980
it's a kind of one-to-one Correspondence

1894
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:10,920
to the label swap in MPS you just remove

1895
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,320
the utmost label

1896
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:19,739
so I said it's almost like mprs but if

1897
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:22,199
you want to Benchmark Sr and PLS we have

1898
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:24,239
to take into consideration something

1899
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,159
more for example

1900
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:30,060
um 56.95 States

1901
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:34,020
you should use a test list of one label

1902
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:37,020
or translated into srmpls that would

1903
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,820
correspond to one seed one segment

1904
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:40,020
identifier

1905
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,159
actually this is not enough we should

1906
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:46,739
consider at least two labels or two

1907
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:49,580
seats in Sr mpls

1908
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:53,460
because we'd like to take into

1909
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,560
consideration for example traffic

1910
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,260
engineering and to do so you just need

1911
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:01,440
two labels for example that is to say

1912
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,020
you are not yet considering the service

1913
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,659
layer so for example if you have a VPN

1914
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:11,159
layer 3 VPN which has or which may have

1915
01:31:11,159 --> 01:31:14,400
Associated another label yeah okay this

1916
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,739
is not under our consideration would be

1917
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:20,340
probably for other efforts

1918
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:25,260
um then again comparing to the uh let's

1919
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:29,699
say basic capability of a 50 56.95 we

1920
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:31,380
have to change a bit the reporting

1921
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,659
format and we have also to take into

1922
01:31:33,659 --> 01:31:36,360
consideration the control protocol to

1923
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:40,260
distribute the seats so the segments IDs

1924
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:43,699
next slide please

1925
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:47,159
all of that corresponds to the changes

1926
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:50,880
we have done from version zero two uh we

1927
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,420
submitted two version one just after the

1928
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,659
other in October to address very good

1929
01:31:57,659 --> 01:32:00,719
comments we have received from Gabor and

1930
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,120
Boris on the list

1931
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,960
um I have to be let's say uh I have to

1932
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,000
to to advance that

1933
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,639
those changes those comments were

1934
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:15,120
equally applicable to to both drafts so

1935
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,280
the one on srmps that we are discussing

1936
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,800
right now and to the next one on service

1937
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,860
six so I'm not going to let's say

1938
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,980
discuss all the topics you see listed

1939
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:28,199
here otherwise we run out of time that

1940
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:31,500
basically we have provided let's say

1941
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,260
more text to address the comments on the

1942
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,560
uh buffer size test on the reference

1943
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:41,580
about using Ethernet or other media that

1944
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:45,120
has that may have the issue of Staffing

1945
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,460
beat or bytes stuffing so this is

1946
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,719
something that should be considered

1947
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,260
especially in the performance test for

1948
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,900
example we need to reference how to deal

1949
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,060
with the address randomization to be

1950
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:00,000
sure that we equally distribute the

1951
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,120
traffic flows across multiple ports on a

1952
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,699
packet for warning engine and so on so

1953
01:33:05,699 --> 01:33:08,940
you see all the the topics here and

1954
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:11,040
pretty sure that eduard during the next

1955
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,860
talk can add more details on that

1956
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:17,059
next slide please

1957
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,780
okay next step so first of all we'd like

1958
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:24,360
to hear from from the community if there

1959
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,760
are more comments more inputs or

1960
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,239
feedback so uh new text that we can add

1961
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:32,880
to this lab to this draft as well as the

1962
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,840
uh the other one we are open to uh

1963
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,480
co-authoring contributions or any

1964
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,120
suggestions here we are more than open

1965
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:45,420
to accept uh further proposals and we

1966
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,639
like also kind of

1967
01:33:47,639 --> 01:33:50,040
um to share a kind of of uh early

1968
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,020
question if the text we have put

1969
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:55,739
together is sufficient is enough is

1970
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:59,159
there anything that we can add just to

1971
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:01,560
start discussing maybe the adoption by

1972
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,060
the working group

1973
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,580
and I will say this is it all I have

1974
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:07,380
that's great that's great thank you

1975
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:11,540
Paulo any questions for Apollo

1976
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,540
okay well I think you've got uh you know

1977
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,940
you had some good review last time uh

1978
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:20,820
let's encourage that uh to continue uh

1979
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,040
one question I've asked in the past is

1980
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,139
it is there any Implement any

1981
01:34:25,139 --> 01:34:27,420
implementation experience with this

1982
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:30,000
testing have you got any example results

1983
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,840
that uh show that this methodology

1984
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,080
um you know is uh solid and working also

1985
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,120
repeatable

1986
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,699
a very good question we are working on

1987
01:34:41,699 --> 01:34:44,520
that so we hope to introduce in the next

1988
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,699
version some let's say data taken from

1989
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:51,179
lab tests there is a Louise one of the

1990
01:34:51,179 --> 01:34:54,360
co-authors that is working on that

1991
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,760
that's great that's great

1992
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,560
um I think that we'll learn a lot from

1993
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,020
uh the lab results that you share with

1994
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:02,880
us and that's when people really get

1995
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,040
excited when we start to see some you

1996
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,100
know some real numbers here so uh

1997
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,780
um I think you know I'll mark that down

1998
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:12,060
as an action item for the authors and

1999
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,699
we'll hope to see that uh next time or

2000
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:17,100
on the list that's great thanks Paula

2001
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,940
thank you

2002
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:30,300
okay so let's move on to the um uh to

2003
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,699
the next one

2004
01:35:32,699 --> 01:35:34,679
which is uh

2005
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:36,620
the IPv6

2006
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,239
uh version of this

2007
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:42,360
I just have to find it there it is

2008
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,560
share

2009
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:46,620
and uh Edward uh you're going to be

2010
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:49,139
presenting yeah I hope you you hear me

2011
01:35:49,139 --> 01:35:52,500
all right yes yes very very well

2012
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,960
yeah

2013
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,600
probably stop here we've got uh

2014
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,420
another 10 minutes for you

2015
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:03,060
yeah I will be much faster no problem uh

2016
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,980
that's great yeah

2017
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,780
next slide please

2018
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:09,139
okay

2019
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:10,500
okay

2020
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,020
um I would say that uh our draft of

2021
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:15,060
course is uh primarily based on the

2022
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:18,420
primary draft of all primary RFC of uh

2023
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:21,380
benchmarking mocking group it's RFC 2544

2024
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:24,060
uh but of course there are many

2025
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:25,380
additional things which has been

2026
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,480
discussed deeply in different routes and

2027
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,659
primarily next different refseu

2028
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:32,520
primarily next two different RC which we

2029
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,060
should mention of course it's a IPv6 RFC

2030
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:40,500
5180 and it's mpls RFC 56.95 but it's

2031
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,659
it's not limited just just to to this

2032
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:44,159
particular if C many things has been

2033
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:45,659
taken especially after comments many

2034
01:36:45,659 --> 01:36:47,699
things has been taken from many other

2035
01:36:47,699 --> 01:36:50,340
RFC we have here a little bit

2036
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,320
challenging situation because the

2037
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,940
service is from one point of view it's

2038
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,760
it's 856 with enhanced heaters it's

2039
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,280
pretty much a pv6 right but from another

2040
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,679
point of view if you look how exactly it

2041
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,719
operates it's pretty similar to mpls for

2042
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:05,219
that reason it's combination it's a

2043
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:08,580
merge of mpls technique and IPv6

2044
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,040
technique for that reason it's a little

2045
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,659
bit special next slide please

2046
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,639
uh okay the service six is pretty much

2047
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:21,900
different unfortunately maybe

2048
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,400
fortunately maybe unfortunately from

2049
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,100
mpls because it has um not just

2050
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,679
different names for uh what we deal uh

2051
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:31,440
with here it's just just not Source node

2052
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,659
or segment and point now the transit

2053
01:37:33,659 --> 01:37:35,880
node uh it's not just in different names

2054
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,620
different uh syntax it's different

2055
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,600
semantic because if you will look to

2056
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,580
transition for example Transit node is a

2057
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,020
node which does not understand the

2058
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:45,960
services it's just normal apv6 not it's

2059
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,520
something pretty different from from

2060
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,800
mpls for the reason it needs special

2061
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,340
procedure and as already Paulo mentioned

2062
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,980
uh we have some restrictions which we

2063
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,020
put on ourselves just

2064
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,659
it's our decision maybe you will tell

2065
01:38:00,659 --> 01:38:02,520
that we are wrong but we will change but

2066
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,739
we would decision that we should limit

2067
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:07,739
draft to some reasonable size and for

2068
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:09,780
that reason we should we have put aside

2069
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,600
services in mpmpls a world it's

2070
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,159
different to decide what a service what

2071
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,360
is transport because it's different

2072
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,639
label in the stack here it's more

2073
01:38:17,639 --> 01:38:20,040
complex because here one seat could have

2074
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,800
a part of of the seed as a transporter

2075
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,199
is effectively uh the destination node

2076
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,000
and part of the seat could be the

2077
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,320
service and for that reason we have

2078
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,179
discussed here in the draft why we have

2079
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:32,580
put aside Services because it's possible

2080
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,380
of course to discuss services but it

2081
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:36,360
will put here Services the draft would

2082
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,639
be from our point of view is extremely

2083
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:39,860
big because number of services

2084
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:42,360
especially for services could be could

2085
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,880
be huge and for that reason services are

2086
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,699
out of the scope here

2087
01:38:47,699 --> 01:38:50,839
next slide please

2088
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:55,650
as as Paulo mentioned from the last

2089
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,100
[Music]

2090
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,960
um

2091
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,880
presentation we have a big update a

2092
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,199
really big update from my point of view

2093
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,940
because thanks for Gabor thanks for

2094
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,000
Burris uh they have pointed to us to

2095
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,520
many things which could be improved uh

2096
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,500
from text size point of view we changed

2097
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,880
something like from my point of view

2098
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,520
maybe 15 percentage maybe 15 percentage

2099
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,320
of text has been changed but from a

2100
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,120
logic point of view because the changes

2101
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,040
are in different effectively in all

2102
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,960
chapters here and for that reason and

2103
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,280
the logic change is much big something

2104
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,719
like 30 percent it should change

2105
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,120
therefore the current revision by the

2106
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,100
way is not the 0.2 we have a little bit

2107
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,620
small update 0.3 the current revision

2108
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:35,580
which you could find on the internet uh

2109
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,739
is much much different from zero zero

2110
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:40,139
for that reason we we ask everybody to

2111
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:42,600
read it again because after Gabor Gabor

2112
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,940
and Bernice comments uh it's it's a

2113
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:47,699
pretty pretty big change uh which we did

2114
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:48,960
here

2115
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,040
next slide please

2116
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,080
um as as you said already as a chair

2117
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,020
said already uh maybe to to proceed for

2118
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:04,080
adoption we need uh to show uh uh the

2119
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,540
test results in the real lab uh for some

2120
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,760
particular look into this particular

2121
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,159
methodology test in the real lab for the

2122
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:12,420
reason maybe we are not ready for

2123
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:15,000
adoption uh just because we don't have a

2124
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,280
test lab but from the tax point of view

2125
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,739
it looks like pretty good already but

2126
01:40:19,739 --> 01:40:22,139
anyway if somebody will read it again

2127
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:24,480
and make some additional comments big

2128
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,320
thanks uh we we are very happy that

2129
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,340
anybody will will give additional

2130
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:32,880
comments that's it from my side

2131
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,820
thanks very much Edward I think that um

2132
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:38,280
you know your appeal to folks who uh

2133
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,520
read this before and provided comments

2134
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,100
uh now that you've made a huge update as

2135
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:46,980
you put it uh would be good if uh some

2136
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:49,080
of those reviewers would go back and and

2137
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,620
see that uh that their wishes were

2138
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:56,040
realized and that would be great so uh

2139
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,199
folks uh if you've read the draft before

2140
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:01,500
I'll ask you to uh go back and take a

2141
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,800
look at this and and see the uh you know

2142
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,320
what uh see what's changed and if you uh

2143
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,440
now like uh how the authors have dealt

2144
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,620
with uh the new situation

2145
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:16,260
um also I really welcome the uh the

2146
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:18,659
implementation of the tests like I said

2147
01:41:18,659 --> 01:41:20,940
before we'll learn a lot from that uh

2148
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,440
the authors won't learn a lot from that

2149
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:26,639
I think and we'll uh we'll see uh uh you

2150
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:27,960
know we'll see what what the

2151
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,600
implications that has for the the test

2152
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,699
methods and the logic as you put it

2153
01:41:32,699 --> 01:41:35,699
Edward so uh thanks for volunteering to

2154
01:41:35,699 --> 01:41:36,960
find a way to do that I'm much

2155
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,380
appreciated

2156
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:43,580
okay any other questions from the group

2157
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,420
okay

2158
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:54,719
there seems to be a comment here

2159
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,380
oh and Boris says he will read again and

2160
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:00,780
provide feedback thank you Boris

2161
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,040
okay

2162
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:05,159
well thanks for uh thanks for the both

2163
01:42:05,159 --> 01:42:08,040
the pieces of work on segment routing I

2164
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,900
think uh you know you guys have gotten

2165
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:11,520
some good review and now it's some good

2166
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,820
input for uh making progress uh so

2167
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:17,299
thanks again

2168
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:21,320
okay

2169
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:26,179
so we can do it

2170
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:30,380
all right

2171
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,480
so I think

2172
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,000
if I'm not mistaken

2173
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,739
we've reached our last talk

2174
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:44,820
and um

2175
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:46,619
you know I'm gonna put the

2176
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:48,480
we've got about we've got about 15

2177
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,520
minutes but I'm going to put I'm going

2178
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,639
to put 10 minutes on this anyway uh Zaki

2179
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:57,659
Y is uh kind of present this uh zekiah

2180
01:42:57,659 --> 01:43:00,420
we got you in the uh the queue here with

2181
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:03,600
your uh with audio yes and it looks like

2182
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,639
you're ready to go

2183
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:08,600
so okay

2184
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,219
can you hear me hello else yes hi Zachy

2185
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:21,540
we can hear you now

2186
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:24,659
okay uh hello everyone I'm very happy to

2187
01:43:24,659 --> 01:43:26,940
have this chance to introduce our latest

2188
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:30,060
works on the considerations for

2189
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,159
benchmarking Network performance in

2190
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:34,380
integrated space and terrestrial Network

2191
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:39,000
so here we go the next page please

2192
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,239
foreign

2193
01:43:43,159 --> 01:43:45,600
now we are entering a new age of

2194
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,520
satellite internet recently we have

2195
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,560
witnessed a rapid evolution in the

2196
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,260
Aerospace industry and the many big

2197
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:54,659
players are actively planning and

2198
01:43:54,659 --> 01:43:56,400
deploying their satellite constitutions

2199
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,380
in the low earth orbit to provide

2200
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:01,260
internet access probably for example as

2201
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:02,880
November of this year Sterling has

2202
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,000
already launched more than 3 000 Leo

2203
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,760
satellites providing internet access to

2204
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:12,360
over 500 000 subscribers in about more

2205
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:15,780
than 14 countries and regions it also

2206
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,880
aims for Global Mobile phone service

2207
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:19,340
after

2208
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:22,860
2023 and in addition many additional

2209
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:24,780
public Central internet constellations

2210
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:27,300
such as one web creeper Boeing are also

2211
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:30,179
in parallel developments this emerging

2212
01:44:30,179 --> 01:44:33,119
Surplus can be integrated with existing

2213
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:35,159
terrestrial networks building an

2214
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:37,080
integrated space and terrestrial Network

2215
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,300
for Progressive and Performance internet

2216
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,340
service globally so this is a background

2217
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:44,659
the next page please

2218
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,619
so on one hand let's like in other kinds

2219
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:51,420
of commercial networks Network

2220
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:54,119
techniques such as the new tech Network

2221
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:57,179
topology protocol functionality are

2222
01:44:57,179 --> 01:44:59,820
expected to be carefully evaluated in an

2223
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,800
isolated test environments we call it

2224
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,920
ite before they are deployed in a live

2225
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,139
production environment and on the other

2226
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:10,619
hand unlike traditional situations rstn

2227
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:12,900
core infrastructures for example these

2228
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:15,480
satellite router switch are hard to

2229
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,940
upgrade after launch especially for

2230
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,580
their own broad Hardware thus it

2231
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:23,040
requires a more systematic and more

2232
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,080
comprehensive evaluation before the

2233
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:29,100
launch last time in ietf 112 we should

2234
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,380
our preliminary considerations for the

2235
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:33,600
problems and requirements of evaluation

2236
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,360
methodology for ICN here is the link of

2237
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:40,260
our previous draft and this time we also

2238
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:43,199
have some questions left over we believe

2239
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,179
discussion should be clarified before

2240
01:45:45,179 --> 01:45:47,699
our full question for example well what

2241
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:50,699
aspects of istn related problem can be

2242
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:52,920
pursued for benchmarking Network Duty

2243
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:55,920
and Sut and also we need to clarify the

2244
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,800
work scope that fits the charter

2245
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,880
so next page please

2246
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:05,460
so this time we try to First clarify the

2247
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:08,820
work scope that is relevant to our fits

2248
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,460
of our Charter I think the major goal of

2249
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,400
our bmwg is to consider a series of

2250
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,040
recommendations concerning the key

2251
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,199
performance characteristics of Internet

2252
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:22,020
working technology so here we summarize

2253
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,179
summarize five important aspects that

2254
01:46:24,179 --> 01:46:26,699
might fit the charter they are for

2255
01:46:26,699 --> 01:46:29,340
example we need to discuss what an

2256
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,320
important role in the istn performance

2257
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,820
for example the constellation topology

2258
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:35,639
Network protocol running upon that and

2259
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:38,340
the hardware capacity and what is the

2260
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:39,840
key performance characteristics

2261
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,880
pertinent to istn for example the

2262
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:44,340
service Quality Service availability and

2263
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:45,900
reliability

2264
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:49,260
third and we we think we can discuss the

2265
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,300
important matches describing above

2266
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,340
characteristics for example user

2267
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,260
perceived latency throughput loss or

2268
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,739
routing convergence and we also need to

2269
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:01,679
clarify how to specify methodologies to

2270
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,080
correct this Matrix above for example

2271
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,760
what is the expected in-like

2272
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,580
benchmarking mass storage for istn and

2273
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,980
what is the concrete concrete approach

2274
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:13,800
and test cases we need to use to

2275
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,260
Benchmark the icetn technology or

2276
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,960
functionalities and finally we also can

2277
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,420
need to describe the common and

2278
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,040
unambiguous results for marketing

2279
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,980
formats so using these two Benchmark to

2280
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,960
report The Benchmark results

2281
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,679
and in the next page we will

2282
01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:34,199
elaborate our the considerations for the

2283
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:36,420
methodology and the two bench for this

2284
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:39,480
Inlet battery match Mark so here we

2285
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:42,300
consider a data driving emulation based

2286
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,820
Benchmark approaches this includes at

2287
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:47,040
high level this approach includes three

2288
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,920
key steps we call them public data

2289
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,560
collection test environment setup and

2290
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,820
running the test

2291
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,780
next page please

2292
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,520
so the first step we call it Community

2293
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,159
German public data collection as we all

2294
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:07,020
know that Leo satellites are public

2295
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:09,719
network infrastructures and operating in

2296
01:48:09,719 --> 01:48:12,420
the outer space so many Constitution

2297
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,520
level information such as the number of

2298
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,619
office the number of satellites per

2299
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:19,739
orbit inclination attitude can be

2300
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:23,040
obtained from the public community so

2301
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,199
such topological information can be

2302
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:28,340
obtained to help us to build the

2303
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:31,500
isolated test environments in addition

2304
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,540
there are some other measurements

2305
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:36,119
platforms allowing users to share and

2306
01:48:36,119 --> 01:48:38,040
their Network management for example

2307
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,679
this is the static results shared by the

2308
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:43,260
speed test platform so this relevance

2309
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:46,500
data can guide us reasonably build and

2310
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,780
configure an isolated test environment

2311
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:53,239
in our laboratory next page please

2312
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:59,760
next please thank you the second step we

2313
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:03,480
call is real data gyro and ite setup in

2314
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,820
this step we can build an I.T via

2315
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:07,679
virtual machine or container based

2316
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,260
emulation the emulation should mimic the

2317
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,300
satellite behaviors such as the time

2318
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:15,139
varying topology distance visibility

2319
01:49:15,139 --> 01:49:18,360
connectivity and network conditions so

2320
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:20,760
this figure shows an example if we want

2321
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,219
to build an environment to mimic a real

2322
01:49:23,219 --> 01:49:25,739
istn like this for example the last left

2323
01:49:25,739 --> 01:49:28,739
picture with two office then in our lab

2324
01:49:28,739 --> 01:49:30,840
environment we can use two machines to

2325
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:34,139
create a virtual representation of these

2326
01:49:34,139 --> 01:49:36,540
environment so like this in each machine

2327
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:39,119
we run a number of virtual machines or

2328
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,580
containers to emulate the satellites and

2329
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,739
manually configure their connectivity

2330
01:49:43,739 --> 01:49:46,260
Network conditions to mimic the time

2331
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:48,239
varying distance with ability and other

2332
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,320
properties

2333
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:52,400
next page please

2334
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:57,420
and in the third step we specify the

2335
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:59,880
device on the test or the system on the

2336
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,460
test for example one day maybe a

2337
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:04,440
satellite operator or research group

2338
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,960
developed a cubesat with a satellite

2339
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,960
processor it runs a customer or modify

2340
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,020
the TCP IP stack and we want to test its

2341
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:14,699
Network performance and power

2342
01:50:14,699 --> 01:50:17,400
consumption in our lab environments we

2343
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:20,280
can use a cluster as the right picture

2344
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:23,340
to build an emulation including a large

2345
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,560
number of virtual satellites depending

2346
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:27,300
on the constellation size you want to

2347
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:29,460
test then we can connect the hardware

2348
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:32,219
for example a device under test running

2349
01:50:32,219 --> 01:50:35,219
some the protocols or functionalities we

2350
01:50:35,219 --> 01:50:37,440
call it isn't consistent on the test to

2351
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,139
the emulation and we can build a

2352
01:50:40,139 --> 01:50:42,060
Hardware in the loop test environments

2353
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:44,760
we can generate the istn traffic for

2354
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,639
example using some tools like my perf to

2355
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:49,560
load the interactive traffic in the lab

2356
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,480
environment and we can measure the

2357
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:53,520
performance for example if you want to

2358
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,980
evaluate a new to writing protocol in

2359
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:58,619
space or evaluate the TCP or quick

2360
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:00,900
throughput in the emulated icing

2361
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:03,000
experimental environments

2362
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,960
next page please

2363
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,460
okay so as our next step we hope we can

2364
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:13,679
have more further discussions and

2365
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:15,840
clarifications to narrow down the scope

2366
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,580
of our work for example we think this

2367
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:22,020
aspects may fit the charter for example

2368
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,719
the class of network functions systems

2369
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,460
or service that are important in

2370
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:27,840
emerging Leo satellite internet

2371
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,360
constellation or STM

2372
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,699
the key performance characteristics

2373
01:51:32,699 --> 01:51:35,820
pertinent to istn and a set of important

2374
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:37,800
benchmarking metrics concrete

2375
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:40,440
benchmarking methodology proper test

2376
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:43,679
case tell it for ICT environments

2377
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:46,500
we also mentioned that we did have some

2378
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,900
correct collaborators from the industry

2379
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:51,860
for example we have some

2380
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:54,600
calibrillat letters from the satellite

2381
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:57,000
operator for the channel Telecom they

2382
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,340
have they indeed have some environment

2383
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:02,400
for their mobile Telecom satellites

2384
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,080
Broadband satellites

2385
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,540
in addition we are also working on some

2386
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:10,020
tools and platforms for operators or

2387
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:13,619
researchers to build a lab level test

2388
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:16,020
environment for example we have some

2389
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:19,500
open source we call it Stoppers and also

2390
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:20,960
we have a

2391
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,980
container-based large-scale stale

2392
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:25,380
emulator we hope this tools can

2393
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:29,400
facilitate the ite creation for istm

2394
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,739
benchmarking in a more flexible and

2395
01:52:31,739 --> 01:52:34,080
convenient way

2396
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,480
next page please

2397
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:39,000
so that's all uh where I'm running out

2398
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,040
of the time and thank you very much and

2399
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,020
any comments or questions are more than

2400
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:45,800
welcome thank you

2401
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:49,500
that's great

2402
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,780
um so you've got star perf and Starry

2403
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:54,540
net here which is

2404
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,760
which are uh

2405
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,100
um I guess they're they're uh funded

2406
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:01,679
projects

2407
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:04,920
yeah there are some uh research projects

2408
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,260
we also have some open source codes

2409
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:10,500
maybe permanently used for education or

2410
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:13,560
researchers that can fast build a test

2411
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:17,179
environment in their lab environment

2412
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:19,619
okay

2413
01:53:19,619 --> 01:53:20,159
um

2414
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:22,020
I mean that that sounds like a good

2415
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:25,500
place uh for um you know some of this

2416
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:29,580
work to get started in the lab and yeah

2417
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:33,179
I I guess maybe the let me let me first

2418
01:53:33,179 --> 01:53:34,619
say

2419
01:53:34,619 --> 01:53:36,900
um the number one thanks for the talk

2420
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:39,619
and I wanted to point out thank you

2421
01:53:39,619 --> 01:53:42,480
something I missed here that you've

2422
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,040
actually got two drafts going

2423
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,480
sic benchmarking which I think is really

2424
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,420
tuned into the material that you talked

2425
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:57,060
about here today in the in the slides is

2426
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:00,980
is that fair to say is that you like

2427
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,639
mm-hmm

2428
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:06,000
okay

2429
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,300
and um so I so we've got we've really

2430
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:12,060
got two stew drafts that uh we'd like

2431
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:15,480
people to be taking a look at okay thank

2432
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:17,820
you maybe we can um in our next step

2433
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:21,540
maybe we can focus on the first one the

2434
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:23,639
SIC benchmarking

2435
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:26,179
okay

2436
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:37,080
that's good so you're kind of leaving

2437
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,179
the other one on and behind

2438
01:54:39,179 --> 01:54:42,360
uh for now when I think this one this

2439
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,280
first one here is a really really

2440
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,280
focused on our uh our particular uh

2441
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,560
needs here and I think that's that's the

2442
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,840
right way to go so uh Thanks For

2443
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,540
Preparing that so uh thank you let me

2444
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:57,900
open it up any any questions in the room

2445
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:01,460
uh for seki

2446
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:10,440
all right well uh well uh mine have a I

2447
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,679
have a question and a comment uh ziki I

2448
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:16,260
think that uh when when you start to

2449
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:19,619
when you start to pursue

2450
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:22,619
ambulation

2451
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:26,280
I think

2452
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:28,320
you uh

2453
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:32,100
I think really uh really all of us will

2454
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:37,639
benefit from um uh the the possibility

2455
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:42,179
uh where you uh describe your uh

2456
01:55:42,179 --> 01:55:44,820
um the emulations that you come up with

2457
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:48,900
and uh in let's say peer-reviewed uh

2458
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,460
conference papers

2459
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:55,080
so we can get some uh wider review you

2460
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:56,760
know beyond the benchmarking methodology

2461
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:00,000
bargaining group and uh and and maybe

2462
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,119
draw on uh some of the folks in the

2463
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:06,300
industry who's uh

2464
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,239
expertise is more in the you know the

2465
01:56:09,239 --> 01:56:12,000
satellite internet constellations and

2466
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,719
the uh the work that's going on there uh

2467
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:18,179
would you uh what you tend to agree to

2468
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:21,440
that uh you know kind of a higher bar

2469
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:25,679
for uh uh getting our emulations I think

2470
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,900
that would be uh but that would be a

2471
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:31,980
really strong step of a foundation that

2472
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:35,000
we could stand on here

2473
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:39,179
okay so uh sure thank you for your

2474
01:56:39,179 --> 01:56:42,239
comments and maybe next time we can show

2475
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,940
some of our emulation results maybe I

2476
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:47,400
think we can further narrow down the

2477
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,800
scope of our work maybe we can focus on

2478
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:53,460
a certain protocol or surveys or

2479
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:56,159
functionality related to this satellite

2480
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:59,059
internet consideration

2481
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:01,860
okay

2482
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:03,840
um but like I said anything in the

2483
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,420
emulation category I think we're going

2484
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,699
to want other people in the industry to

2485
01:57:08,699 --> 01:57:11,580
weigh in and say that you know it's a

2486
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:14,820
reasonable emulation or it needs work

2487
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:16,679
you know those are that's the kind of

2488
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:18,000
feedback

2489
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,860
um I think you know just speaking as a

2490
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:21,900
participant I'd feel much more

2491
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:25,380
comfortable if uh real experts uh

2492
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:28,020
weighed in on this okay okay okay okay

2493
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:32,099
okay as I said maybe I can ask some of

2494
01:57:32,099 --> 01:57:34,739
our car operators from the real

2495
01:57:34,739 --> 01:57:38,940
satellite operators to join this meeting

2496
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:41,400
next time if possible

2497
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:42,540
okay

2498
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:45,659
all right sure the more the merrier in

2499
01:57:45,659 --> 01:57:47,460
fact I don't think I don't think we'll

2500
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,980
be able to complete this work without uh

2501
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,980
adding up you know some number of of

2502
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:56,040
real experts uh Beyond yourselves as the

2503
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,099
co-authors who can help us here so you

2504
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:01,080
know we want to get the strong review

2505
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:04,440
and uh than a strong foundation for this

2506
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,199
if we take it up

2507
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:10,098
yeah I see

2508
01:58:14,099 --> 01:58:16,500
good

2509
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,659
uh well I think then

2510
01:58:18,659 --> 01:58:20,940
uh you know the path forward here is

2511
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:24,060
anybody who's interested in Leo uh

2512
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:26,099
satellite Communications and it's

2513
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:28,139
becoming more and more popular every day

2514
01:58:28,139 --> 01:58:31,080
I encourage you to read this uh this

2515
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,360
first draft that's on the screen and

2516

provide your feedback and um let's try

2517
01:58:36,599 --> 01:58:38,580
to get uh you know let's try to make

2518
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,219
some progress on this and and also the

2519
01:58:41,219 --> 01:58:43,560
other topics which are are candidates

2520
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:47,520
for bmwg work between now and and our

2521
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,760
next meeting uh next Mark March that's

2522
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:54,420
the uh that's the goal for all of us it

2523
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,659
requires uh doing some homework reading

2524
01:58:57,659 --> 01:59:00,000
the drafts providing comments on the

2525
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,880
list and uh you know just being helpful

2526
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,900
to one another so uh for example uh Zach

2527
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:09,119
UI you could take a look at some of the

2528
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:12,659
other work that has been promoted

2529
01:59:12,659 --> 01:59:15,659
yeah and and really that's the way uh

2530
01:59:15,659 --> 01:59:18,480
all of us help each other and get this

2531
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:19,679
work done

2532
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,739
so um uh

2533
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:25,920
I guess that's it so so any final

2534
