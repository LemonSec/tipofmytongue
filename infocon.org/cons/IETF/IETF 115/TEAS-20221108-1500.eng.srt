00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,760
the the link into the chat for uh

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,480
session editing

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,820
all right so welcome to the continuation

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,400
of teas in London thank you all who have

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,500
come back we've lost more than half the

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,660
room we'll see how many come back in

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,260
uh and how many just need to log in on

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,779
uh using the QR code

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,240
um we have the usual uh Public Service

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,279
Announcement please wear a mask please

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,200
wear it properly please wear a proper

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,520
one

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,500
um except if you're speaking at the

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,379
front of the room

15
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:42,540
and we have the ietf notewell which is

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,860
the one administrative slide we're

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,559
required to show so we're showing it

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,760
everyone was here in the previous

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,620
session right so you know it and if you

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,320
weren't please uh just go take a look at

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,420
the uh the link at the bottom of the

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,879
page if you're not familiar with uh

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,320
rules of contribution

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,660
and with that we're going to move right

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,559
on to shusang

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,479
uh hi this is Jason and I will introduce

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,000
our update about itm Network slides

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,040
application in 5G end-to-end that whole

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,700
slice presenting other quarters

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,439
considering this is a Hot Topic so it's

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,159
very glad to present in this idea next

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,640
slide please

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,880
uh just a very brief uh overview of why

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
we have this document there are a lot of

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,220
applications for item Network slides and

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,299
we think 5G is one of the most important

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,320
application scenario so we have three

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,420
documents about this topic and before it

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,259
have 104 we are suggested by the all uh

40
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,780
chairs to merge these three documents

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,360
and during process we collect a lot of

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,420
feedback from the uh these working group

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,759
so we also modify the contents and and

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,880
some missing point and we have a new

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,560
document for this topic and uh basically

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,840
this document is trying to answer the

47
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,700
following key questions the first one is

48
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,400
the rule of ietm network slides in 5G

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,319
Network slice and the second one is the

50
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,720
existing 3gpp work that has already been

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,120
done which is really related to item

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,819
Network slides and how to map the GP

53
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,640
NATO slides to item mental slice uh next

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,059
slide please

55
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,819
uh here is the draft structure and we

56
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,459
really make some progress in the new

57
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,040
version the version one and make it make

58
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,560
the structure more stable uh in section

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,900
three because we collect some feedback

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,239
from community so we update the figures

61
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
and terminologies to avoid introducing

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,099
unnecessary 3gpp Concepts to make itl

63
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,340
people confused and for section 4 we

64
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,080
give some overview of the mapping

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,480
between 3gp and ITF Network slides

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
between going into details about the

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,300
mapping process and for section five uh

68
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,340
we clarify the relationship between the

69
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,980
existing 3gpp parameters that are have

70
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,459
already been defined in TS uh age

71
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,440
28.501 uh clarify the relationship

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,780
between it with the itm network slides

73
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,120
and in section 6 which is the main part

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,040
of the document we modified the script

75
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,819
descript descriptions and terminology uh

76
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,739
some updates in terminology next

77
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,379
slightly please

78
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,319
uh this slide actually has already been

79
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,239
introduced by Raza index ietf uh the the

80
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,459
motivation here is just to show the

81
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,060
scope of this document to answer what is

82
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,420
uh the rule of itm network slides in

83
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,940
February scenario uh the scope of this

84
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,799
document we what we are trying to cover

85
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,220
is all the connection between 5G net

86
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,400
Network functions uh that can be

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,140
connected by an ITF Network slice so uh

88
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,459
depending on the Run technology

89
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,980
deployment there may be a different

90
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,180
interface that can be that can use item

91
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,820
Network slides to connect the different

92
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,820
network functions and based on the

93
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,340
comments from community that I have

94
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,520
already mentioned we just replaced some

95
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,520
the detailed Concepts from 3dp site and

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,699
we just think different interface May

97
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,860
introduce no difference for itl parts so

98
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,080
just make them all showed as Network

99
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,139
functions for uh for in the picture and

100
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,040
to show what the ITF Network slides will

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,759
be inside different scenarios next slide

102
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
please

103
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,000
yes and here we give some this is a new

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,280
section we try to give some overview of

105
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,620
the mapping between 3gpp and itm network

106
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,220
slices uh we just take the connection

107
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,460
between run UPF as an example and show

108
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,040
the options realizing 5G Antoine that

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,060
was live mapping uh for example the V

110
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,340
Line uh here we introduce a new

111
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,800
terminology we call it handoff or

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
handoff ID which is used between a 3gpp

113
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,160
site and ITF side to just

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,740
um do the mapping in different uh

115
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,639
scenarios and uh we we give some

116
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,039
examples about how to do the mapping for

117
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,340
example V Line uh as the handoff ID MPS

118
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,400
label as handoff ID and sr6 Seed as

119
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,660
handoff ID I have to

120
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,400
mentioned that all these three uh

121
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,820
options has or has also been defined in

122
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,240
the 3gpp parameters so we think it works

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,460
we also give some considerations for the

124
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,539
case of policy based routing and uh gtpu

125
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,479
UDP cells part based

126
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,120
mapping which is defined in

127
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,940
another document in DMM working group

128
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,440
Next slide please

129
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,800
uh yes I think this part is one of the

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,500
main progress in uh in this version

131
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,860
because we think the GP transport

132
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,660
especially the related parameters

133
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,900
defined in EP transport uh is the most

134
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,620
related part in your PPP to connection

135
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,120
with uh ITF Network slides and we can

136
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,460
see the parameters that are have already

137
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,259
been defined in EDP transported in the

138
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,900
table it includes the IP address logical

139
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,419
interface infer next hobby infrared cues

140
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,960
profile uh all these attributes could be

141
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,660
used in uh in the mapping of 3gpp

142
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,180
between 3gp Network slice and ITF

143
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,819
Network slides especially the next half

144
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,460
info which identifies the Ingress

145
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,199
transplant node each node can be

146
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,840
identified by any combination of IP

147
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,300
address of Next Top router of transform

148
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,699
Network system name post name and App

149
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,400
Management address of Transformer nodes

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,500
which means that we can use information

151
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,800
of this information to choose the PE

152
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,400
node in TN domain and also another

153
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,580
important set of parameters is logical

154
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,120
interface infer which are which is a set

155
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,699
of parameters include logical interface

156
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,580
type and The Logical interface ID it

157
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,699
specifies the type and identify of The

158
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,919
Logical interface as I have mentioned in

159
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,800
the in the previous slide it it could be

160
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,460
a villain ID amps tag or segment ID so

161
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,160
uh if this is assigned equally

162
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,340
personalized so it can be used to map

163
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,160
3gpe Network slides to item number Slice

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,460
on that side please

165
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,400
uh actually these figures we have uh

166
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
presented uh several times in ITF uh

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,520
meeting the it just shows the overview

168
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,099
process of how we do Network slice

169
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,840
mapping uh basically the the LSM this

170
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,240
sorry this terminology is from 3gp side

171
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
but it's uh equals it equals the

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,479
oxidator in ITF uh framework document

173
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,860
the ismf will receive some requests from

174
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,379
the customer and create network slides

175
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,620
and the the requirement and will be

176
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,179
separated and to push the uh the subnet

177
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,940
controller to create their own network

178
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,399
slides to make them all together to

179
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,099
satisfy the overall requirement and for

180
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,919
the ietl part the item Network slice

181
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,540
controller will create uh the the the

182
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,980
itm network slides and with the item

183
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,440
neutral slice identifier and in this

184
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,160
progress there will will be some mapping

185
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,740
relationship allocated by the management

186
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,339
plan to the CE and the PE node to

187
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,800
let them know which stage PPE Network

188
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,320
slides will be mapped to which ITF

189
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,200
Network slides handoff ID and for the PE

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,860
size it it shows that which item Network

191
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,399
slides handoff IDE will be mapped to

192
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,540
which itm level slides uh and next slide

193
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,779
please

194
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,720
uh so uh we think uh after a lot of

195
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,480
discussions among the others and a lot

196
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,660
of uh work from contributions and also

197
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,540
we collect a lot of comments from the

198
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,959
working group we haven't I have to admit

199
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,240
that we haven't lost all of the comments

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,519
and we just released them in the GitHub

201
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,860
but we think the the structure of the

202
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,620
document is quite stable and we think

203
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,019
it's a good start for further uh

204
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,500
discussion about this topic so we we

205
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,380
request for uh one group adoption and

206
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,240
always reveals and comments are welcome

207
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,940
we will have weekly call meeting and it

208
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,240
is open to anyone who is interested and

209
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,820
we will keep modify modifying the

210
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,339
dolphin actually there is a Meetup among

211
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,760
the others uh this morning and we will

212
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,260
slightly change the order of the

213
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,540
document but the the contents are we

214
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,820
think are stable and we will give some

215
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,040
detailed example about how to do the

216
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,160
mapping especially use the Nvidia model

217
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,080
that has already been adopted by working

218
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,000
group yes

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,519
okay notwithstanding going over time so

220
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,839
not really leaving time for this

221
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,339
question which is definitely bad form

222
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,720
we're going to ask the working group

223
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,240
whether or not uh are there any

224
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,420
objections to adopting this document

225
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,060
raise your hands if you object

226
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,640
uh lower your hands if you've read the

227
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
document and you think it's ready and if

228
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
you haven't read it or don't have an

229
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,760
opinion please don't do anything

230
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
and we're going to bring up the next uh

231
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,980
uh presentation

232
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,019
sure so it's Julian

233
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,300
so an interesting thing is is when you

234
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,880
change presentation it ends the poll so

235
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,760
you had a very very short poll with not

236
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,779
a whole lot of participants and uh uh I

237
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,560
have no idea what's going on there but

238
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,860
uh the conclusion is

239
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,140
um it's really mixed and not huge

240
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,600
support so you know I don't I can't

241
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,220
judge whether it's because of the time

242
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,079
or not but

243
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,760
um if you want if you're going to ask

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,500
the working group to adopt your document

245
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,120
and you want us to take it seriously you

246
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,920
got to leave time for that

247
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,640
thank you

248
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,260
right so everyone so this is talking

249
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,620
about the realization of

250
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,980
um ITF Network slices for the 5G use

251
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,740
case using current ipmpls Technologies

252
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,320
and this is on behalf of all of my

253
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,420
co-authors who are listed here next

254
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,019
slide please

255
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,339
so by way of reminder

256
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,740
um the overall goal of this draft was to

257
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,720
take 5G

258
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,120
um slicing as the use case and to see to

259
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,180
what extent ietf Network slices can be

260
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,339
implemented using current IP and mpls

261
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:32,899
Technologies next slide

262
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,279
and so here are the differences between

263
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,700
the current version which is zero two

264
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,100
and zero zero zero one had a lifetime of

265
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,240
about one hour because that's something

266
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,399
that we forgot to add and so it became

267
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,740
zero to you know one hour later

268
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,940
um first of all

269
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,160
um we'd like to welcome Reza Louis and

270
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,339
Benny as um co-authors to the draft um

271
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,079
zero two

272
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,940
um in section two

273
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,380
um we added some extra material because

274
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,139
what we wanted to do is to describe how

275
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,300
um the overall data path from a network

276
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,100
function which might be on a compute and

277
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,300
one DC to a network function somewhere

278
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,519
across the network again perhaps on a

279
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
compute in another DC how that

280
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,180
end-to-end data path

281
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,240
um has several different sections to it

282
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,540
under the control of different

283
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,639
orchestration because you have a sort of

284
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,760
Sandwich where you've got what we call a

285
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,680
local segment then we've got the

286
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,540
transport segment in the middle and then

287
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,240
the local segments on the other side the

288
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,120
local segments being controlled by you

289
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,680
know service management orchestrator

290
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
while the transport segment in the

291
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,060
middle is controlled by the ietf NSC and

292
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,320
also we mentioned some special cases

293
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,260
where a data path between a pair of NFS

294
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,120
could just be a local segment because

295
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,519
they're co-located in the same data

296
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,579
center still with section two

297
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,740
um we

298
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,480
previously had an overview of 5G

299
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,779
networking as

300
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,860
pertaining to the content of draft

301
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,959
that's relevant to the contents of this

302
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,600
um draft but for ease of readability of

303
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,260
the main body of the draft we moved that

304
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,079
overview to appendix B

305
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,420
now section three

306
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,339
um section three in previous versions

307
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,360
had

308
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,620
um discussed

309
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,620
um two handoff methods between

310
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,360
um you know for example the brand domain

311
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,940
you know presented by DC and the

312
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,339
um also mobile core domains

313
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,560
um and their transport Network

314
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,540
um the two um previous methods of

315
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,720
handoff discussed were VLAN handoff and

316
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,480
also IP handoff IP handoff by with

317
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
example being if you've got ipsec

318
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,540
running between

319
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,180
um you know a pair of NFS

320
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,860
um and so in this new version of the

321
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,380
draft we added a additional handoff

322
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,380
method namely into provider option b and

323
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,019
this um is well suited to a situation

324
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,579
where

325
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,980
um let's suppose layer 3 vpns are used

326
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,139
as the underpinning

327
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,240
um the layer 3 VPN vrfs are actually

328
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,940
located on the compute perhaps on a

329
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,639
virtualized router on the same server as

330
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,560
that's hosting the network

331
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,040
um functions and that um its roots are

332
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,800
communicated via bgp perhaps to a DC

333
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,139
Gateway and from then to the PE that

334
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,560
faces the DC and so on across the

335
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,079
network so what you have in that

336
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,420
situation is Enterprise of option b so

337
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,060
we wanted to document

338
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,760
um that and then finally and we have a

339
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,300
new section section five which talks

340
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,199
about

341
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,399
um how one

342
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,399
um you know could deal with or not um

343
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,480
5qi 5qi stands for um 5G cos indicator

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
of course

345
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,720
um that in itself isn't

346
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,699
um a direct actual group of a packet but

347
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,019
sometimes people map that 5qi value to a

348
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,260
dscp and value and so one model is you

349
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,079
say for a given slice that slice is

350
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
mapped onto you know one particular cue

351
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,100
as it travels through the network and

352
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,220
therefore it's 5qi unaware or the other

353
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,699
model is 5qi aware mode where

354
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:18,300
um according to five qis that exist

355
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,699
multiple of them within the same slice

356
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,279
encoded onto dscp

357
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,779
um you know those different packets

358
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,019
could be mapped onto different

359
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,699
um you know queues as the packets travel

360
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,279
across the transport Network and we have

361
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,199
corresponding diagrams I may have

362
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,120
example

363
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,240
um to illustrate each of those two cases

364
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,639
so now let's move on to the final slide

365
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,019
please

366
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,899
so finally um you know given that

367
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,880
um we've received a lot of interest in

368
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,980
the draft we'd like to

369
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,560
um as a Next Step request adoption as a

370
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,518
working group draft

371
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,579
uh

372
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,300
hi Julian this is joseon thank you for

373
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,900
our presentation I just think uh this is

374
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,480
um a really interesting topic and I

375
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,059
think it's a valid matter to realize uh

376
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,939
ITF transport slides in 5G scenario with

377
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,720
existing Technologies uh still I I have

378
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,079
seen some possible overlap between my

379
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,939
document and your document because we

380
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,380
all we both focus on the 5G scenario and

381
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,860
even the something like handoff ID maybe

382
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,760
also both considered in our documents so

383
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,840
I

384
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,440
um I just want to seek your suggestion

385
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,419
or suggestion from chairs or working

386
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,480
group do we need to correct cooperate

387
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,780
together with these two documents or we

388
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,679
can coordinate better with our different

389
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,120
contents

390
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,120
yes um they do certainly cover similar

391
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,919
ground and therefore there is some

392
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,840
degree of overlap I mean certainly we

393
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,760
can look to see

394
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,860
um you know how one could address it I

395
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,799
mean one method might be

396
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,600
um you know if there's places where

397
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
there's a lot of overlap we remove the

398
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,860
overlap so instead of having overlap one

399
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,360
draft in across the first the other and

400
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,919
says in for more detail you know look in

401
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,919
section 5.1 of this other draft

402
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,160
um or you know the Other Extreme is you

403
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,080
know merging the drafts so we could you

404
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,179
know look in detail at you know the sort

405
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,340
of overlaps the non-overlaps and see you

406
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,140
know what can be done accordingly and

407
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,760
suggest because they did come out at

408
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,419
about the same time

409
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,799
sure we can talk afterwards thank you

410
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,600
I think the motivations of the two

411
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,520
documents are slightly different uh

412
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,039
there is some text in this document that

413
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,600
could clearly move to the other document

414
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,940
but uh in terms of the motivation of

415
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,679
document it's uh clearly different

416
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,679
see

417
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,840
from Hawaii yeah I think this document

418
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,900
is interesting it provides a

419
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,080
one option to realize the to support the

420
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,419
5G Network slicing with existing ITF

421
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:10,440
Technologies

422
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,240
and actually in this working group we

423
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,179
also have other options for this similar

424
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,120
purpose like vaping plus and as you

425
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,059
mentioned in the slides you say that you

426
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,419
want to describe to what extent the

427
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,940
existing technology can be used in the

428
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,600
scenario and I would suggest include

429
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,440
this in the document so that you can say

430
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,080
the applicability of this existing

431
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,000
Technologies and also the limitations

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,919
useful for people to understand the

433
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
difference between different options so

434
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
that can choose a simple suitable tool

435
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,679
for their Network for

436
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,280
so are you suggesting we analyze

437
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,460
um things that are not under the

438
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,580
category of existing

439
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,039
um you know IPM PLS Technologies by both

440
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,320
contrast like are you saying but even

441
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,260
though the main sorts of direction of

442
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,299
the draft is using current ipmpls

443
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,679
Technologies are you saying we ought to

444
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,780
way out of against alternative

445
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,799
technology X Y and Z in order to

446
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,660
highlight

447
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,200
you know potential advantages

448
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,679
what you had in mind yeah my suggestion

449
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,380
is uh as you imagine that in the slides

450
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,080
you want to identify to what extent this

451
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,260
technology our mechanism is suitable for

452
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,320
the 5G Network slicing so I suggest the

453
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,620
document could uh specify this in the

454
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,039
text with some text to which are the

455
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,620
applicable scenarios to use existing

456
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,320
Technologies so that will be helpful for

457
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,780
people to understand when they can use

458
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,059
existing technology and when they will

459
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,640
need some enhancement to achieve maybe

460
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,640
for some critical services in the 5G or

461
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,980
other scenarios yeah I mean certainly

462
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,440
the overall sort of premise of the draft

463
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,480
was asserting that one could address the

464
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,980
5G slicing use case using like in PLS

465
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,679
current Technologies and then you know

466
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,120
the body of the draft

467
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,660
um then exposes that you know explains

468
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,160
that

469
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,740
um since that was the sort of overall

470
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,700
purpose drafts

471
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,020
okay maybe we can discuss offline yeah

472
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,059
indeed

473
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,840
unfortunately we've pretty much taken

474
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,640
the rest of your time rezzo if you want

475
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,900
to ask a question why the next person

476
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,440
comes up that would be uh fine it's uh

477
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,860
Drew reserved from Sienna as a co-author

478
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,280
of both documents uh so the this

479
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,140
document explicitly talk about their

480
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,780
realization detail of that and the

481
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,320
document that susanka explained is one

482
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,020
layer up and it's kind of abstraction of

483
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,260
that it it would be a good idea to next

484
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,380
meeting we put a hierarchy all these

485
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,179
documents together how they are related

486
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,919
you know the title is the same for

487
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,620
people who don't know it they might be

488
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,380
you know not clear but definitely there

489
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,120
is differences between them thank you

490
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,740
thank you for the comment thank you for

491
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,419
the uh presentation there's clearly

492
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,940
interest uh in the topic so we'd like to

493
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,980
hear more certainly if there's Parts you

494
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,720
can combine with existing documents or

495
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,100
other documents that's always great

496
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,440
right it seems like you're not covering

497
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,539
exactly the same topic so there's room

498
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,380
for multiple documents here thank you

499
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,260
that's Groove yeah uh I'll be talking

500
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,620
about uh uh Network slicing mapping so

501
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,799
on the same lines next slide please

502
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,020
uh basically we have a working group

503
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,200
document which is uh T service mapping

504
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,780
uh it Define a grouping that grouping

505
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,320
has been used to augment l3sm l2sm L1

506
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,260
CSM with mapping of how this service

507
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,559
uses the underlyte resources uh whether

508
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,020
it is in form of v and T topology or

509
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,299
tunnel the same thing we also apply for

510
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,840
Network models and this how work has

511
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,820
been going on in the working room for a

512
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,280
while now but one thing was missing that

513
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,679
we don't have a similar thing for IIT of

514
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,900
network slices and at the same time we

515
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,340
didn't want to overload this current

516
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,559
document which is anywhere very big and

517
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,179
even the mapping requirements are little

518
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,039
different because especially with NRP

519
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,720
coming into the picture so it makes

520
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,299
sense to have a separate document which

521
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,820
is talking about how do we map uh slice

522
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,520
service to the underlyte resources next

523
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,679
slide please

524
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,100
so uh this is that mapping model

525
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,919
basically the new requirement also is

526
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,980
that we need to map to NRP so once we

527
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,740
have got the ndi which is the top level

528
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,039
this we are mapping that NBI to what is

529
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,140
the NRP that is instantiated in the

530
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,059
network and then uh if uh l3nm like

531
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,159
services are being used as Lewis had

532
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,260
presented in the earlier presentation

533
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,419
with the mapper and the realizer if the

534
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,480
below thing is a network model like l2nm

535
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,580
or l3nm you can have a mapping to that

536
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,460
as well as well as maintain the mapping

537
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,880
to NRP plus we can also map to T

538
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,640
resources so that's the next slide so

539
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,400
the existing mapping that we had for uh

540
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,280
for T resources that can also be done so

541
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,740
all we provide flexibility in this case

542
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,820
would be like in the previous

543
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,220
presentation which was trying to use the

544
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,320
existing technology and not create an

545
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,419
art piece yes that's fine you could

546
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,460
directly map things to the T resources

547
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,460
uh this mapping realization model would

548
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,460
allow that uh the idea here would be

549
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,679
that this mapping you know gets

550
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,480
populated when you do the realization of

551
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,500
the slice you could also allow

552
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,840
configuration only in cases where maybe

553
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
if the topology is exposed already to

554
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,480
the customer they have they can also do

555
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,880
some more control over how the network

556
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,100
how the things are realized that option

557
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,320
I don't see it being used that much but

558
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,059
currently it is there we are looking for

559
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,039
feedback whether that should be there or

560
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,260
we should just make this read-only and

561
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,960
not allow configuration at all right now

562
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,179
it is allowed so we want to get feedback

563
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,659
for that as well

564
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:27,539
uh and continuing in the same thread uh

565
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,460
there is a possibility also to have

566
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,980
multiple map types so right now we are

567
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,200
basically borrowing things from how we

568
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,720
have done for ITF networks uh for the

569
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,480
teas service mapping we wanted to see

570
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,940
what needs to apply for ITF Network

571
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,799
slides as well and what we should change

572
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,260
so looking for feedback on that next

573
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,120
slide

574
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,539
a very high level this is what the we

575
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,880
are augmenting ITF Network slice Define

576
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,919
a container called mapping you can map

577
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,980
to nrps to l3nm l2nm or to te in case of

578
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,200
T we simply reuse the grouping that

579
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,720
already exists for T service mapping and

580
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,419
that's basically uh what the current

581
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,080
model design is next slide

582
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,360
this is the tree I think we can go to

583
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,220
the questions

584
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,000
and use that time so uh first question

585
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,279
in our mind right now I have only done

586
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,000
the mapping for slice that at the ITF

587
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,039
Network slice level I'm mapping it to

588
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,039
NRP do we need to do mapping at the

589
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,919
other constructs like at each collection

590
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,140
group level or connectivity construct

591
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,320
level or is that not necessary this is

592
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,480
not very clear as of now so we want to

593
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,179
get more feedback on that similarly

594
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,820
should we map sdps into say sites of

595
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,000
l3sm ltsm or let Let It Be figured out

596
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,980
during the realization time there is no

597
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,080
such clear requirement that this kind of

598
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,240
mapping would be useful or not that is

599
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,520
not clear so we want to get feedback on

600
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,820
that should we allow multiple map types

601
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,860
Etc and of course the the major work

602
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,539
would be we need to add some examples to

603
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,580
make sure that people understand how to

604
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,980
use this model and how would it be

605
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,640
useful so that's also something what to

606
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,340
do and maybe if there is consensus that

607
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,260
this is useful we can go and update

608
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,960
Lewis earlier documents and add this one

609
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,480
as also one of the young models that

610
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,460
could be used when we are thinking of

611
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,820
how ITF Network slices are realized I

612
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,860
think that's my next last slide so

613
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,459
questions please

614
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,360
no one is asking a last one

615
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,220
um so you said you did not want to

616
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,520
augment the T use the te service mapping

617
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,779
model

618
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:52,380
um

619
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,880
again is it because of the technology

620
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,460
agnostic positive taking or no so

621
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,679
basically if you see in the tea service

622
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,779
we have a common model which is just a

623
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,240
grouping and then what we do is we have

624
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,539
augment of l3sm augment of l2sm augment

625
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,120
of L1 CSM all these multiple models in

626
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,640
the same draft uh we could also add

627
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,400
augment of IQ of Netflix size right now

628
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,679
we kept we want to keep it in a separate

629
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,720
document because if when last time I was

630
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,760
presenting this t-service this was the

631
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,620
exact question I asked the working group

632
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,179
and at that time the idea would be that

633
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,860
we will be blocking these service

634
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,520
mapping for a long time uh let's get get

635
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,620
this separation that's one reason and

636
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,360
second none of the other things care

637
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,640
about NRP this would be the only one

638
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,919
where an RP concept is coming in so it

639
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,620
makes more sense to keep this separate

640
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,039
and uh add the NRP concept only for ITF

641
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,020
Network slice mapping and keep the other

642
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,299
things separate okay

643
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,340
um well let's discuss that more on the

644
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,220
list one uh you currently augment the

645
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,400
slice service model yes so why don't you

646
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,220
consider moving this to that to a

647
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,779
service model itself

648
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,159
I think we could do that with that

649
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,260
working would be also thinking of it as

650
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,820
a working group last call again you add

651
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,179
things that whole thing changes cells

652
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,500
contains small enough yeah if the

653
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,900
working group feels this is useful

654
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,880
the only thing would be then the moment

655
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,880
you do that then the an RPM model also

656
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,200
needs to be standardized before this

657
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,020
happens so move it you you try to put

658
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,200
this in the NBI that's also something to

659
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,299
worry about I would rather not do that I

660
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:31,380
think

661
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,179
like more sense to keep it separate

662
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,799
so while we're bringing you up for the

663
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,720
next one I got it

664
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,919
Oh I thought

665
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,039
oh sorry Sergio I missed that go ahead

666
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,779
yeah you hear me

667
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,200
okay uh Drew just a clarification it

668
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,179
seems to me that the Europe

669
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,760
the prefix of the model as a network

670
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,679
slice if it is uh MBI young model it

671
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,760
seems to me that is a NS test

672
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,799
uh traffic so

673
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,320
am I wrong

674
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,299
are you talking about what is the prefix

675
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,880
that I use in the young bottle yes yes

676
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,760
the prefix if you use the augmentation

677
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,760
from a NBI model it is ITF

678
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,440
N double s

679
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,340
NSS but I noticed that in your

680
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,700
augmentation is just an s

681
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,580
okay oh sorry so I'll fix that thank you

682
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,500
okay

683
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,480
okay yeah my mistake all right we're

684
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,039
gonna move on to the next one I actually

685
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,980
received a private message to ask the

686
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,039
room to please put on masks if you are

687
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,620
uh sitting in the room

688
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,899
thank you so let's move to the second

689
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,480
one again it's zero three but first time

690
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm presenting this this is about

691
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,159
traffic mapping Yang model uh next slide

692
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,120
please

693
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,600
uh again when we were discussing T

694
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,179
service mapping this was one of the open

695
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,279
issues that were listed that we don't

696
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,700
really have a good way to also tell what

697
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,740
traffic flows in the parts and the

698
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,980
services that we are currently

699
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,539
establishing so this is an attempt again

700
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,220
uh

701
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,740
sort of like a straw man getting a feel

702
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,120
from the room that whether this will be

703
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,100
useful work to continue or not

704
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,520
so background we know in ITF we have

705
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,740
various young models we set up various

706
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,340
PE Services tunnels Parts Sr policies

707
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,320
all that stuff but we don't really have

708
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,899
a good Yang model that clearly says what

709
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,840
traffic flows over these parts and

710
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,580
services we have various different

711
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,700
things like we have ACL and then what

712
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,419
happens is at various uh models they try

713
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:06,059
to do it themselves ITF Network slice is

714
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,799
also trying to do it via something

715
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,840
called as a match criteria we have

716
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,059
protocols like bgp and psap both have

717
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,539
flow spec as a way to Signal this and

718
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,880
some of the models also have the flow

719
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,179
match criteria based on IP UDP and TCP

720
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,100
headers so we have various people doing

721
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,539
various different things but not

722
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,940
something that is standardized in the

723
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,340
Yang model point of view so the question

724
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,299
is

725
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:33,779
is this even possible are we too late uh

726
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,520
and if we want to do it what is the

727
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,779
right way to do it so these are the

728
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,880
questions in front of the room so let me

729
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,919
just give uh at a very very high level

730
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,080
what my thinking is and then we'll open

731
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,919
uh the discussion next slide please

732
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,380
so where could this be useful I think

733
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,299
there are various ways where having a

734
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:54,240
standard traffic mapping model would be

735
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,760
quite useful various AG models do not

736
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,159
mention this at all and people use their

737
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,740
own proprietary way to figure uh things

738
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,980
out uh outside of just e there are

739
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,240
various different things happening in

740
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,399
ITF for instance traffic classification

741
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,580
for service function chaining uh APN

742
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,799
buff was supposed to happen didn't but

743
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,779
they also have traffic classification so

744
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,500
this idea of uh having a way to identify

745
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,960
traffic is quite important at various

746
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,299
levels in the ITF but we do not have a

747
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,399
standard way to do this as of now next

748
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,740
slide

749
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,140
now the issue uh with this kind of

750
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,480
mapping would be that should we pick one

751
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,159
I don't think so that would make sense

752
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,200
uh because people have different

753
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,179
requirements they map it uh using

754
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,220
different things they will use different

755
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,460
way to achieve this so should we have

756
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,039
this as a way of just maintaining the

757
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,019
various different ways in which you can

758
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,120
map you can still create an ACL but just

759
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,760
maintain a reference so that I could try

760
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,440
to figure out what traffic is Flowing

761
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,000
where what is the actions being taken

762
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
maybe doing some statistics as well on

763
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,580
this various different flows so continue

764
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,580
to allow multiple ways to do this but

765
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,960
still maintain in a carbon Place uh a

766
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,820
common place what kind of mapping is

767
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,399
being done that's one approach uh that

768
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,699
we were discussing it is not ideal but

769
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,679
it's one approach we don't even have for

770
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,599
instance a flow spec Yang model as of

771
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,719
now so this is just things in the air uh

772
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,879
but some of them we have ACL model is

773
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,000
pretty good uh uh saying things that

774
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,099
whatever traffic that you receive on a

775
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,359
particular interface

776
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,460
the things that we do for VPN pretty

777
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,500
straightforward we can directly have a

778
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,659
way to identify the sites and interfaces

779
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,399
and port numbers that's pretty

780
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,379
straightforward so some parts are

781
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,359
straightforward some part not but this

782
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,418
is at a high level what could look like

783
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,760
a good traffic mapping young model next

784
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,560
slide

785
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,619
just a rough three of various things uh

786
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,240
having some statistics having some

787
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,000
actions that could also be useful again

788
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,160
keeping it optional so that you could do

789
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,800
it in various different ways that's

790
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
is proposed here next slide

791
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,240
but the main question is is this even

792
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,579
useful basically the models have been

793
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,079
developed people have been doing their

794
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,180
own ways this this is not a new problem

795
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,400
people set up a service because they

796
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,140
wanted some traffic to flow they have

797
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,880
solved this problem in different ways

798
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,920
maybe we are too late and there's no

799
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,500
point of continuing this then maybe this

800
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,000
will be the last time I'll present this

801
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,040
or if there is an interest that this is

802
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,740
useful and the approach that we are

803
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,540
taking is correct then we may continue

804
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,780
to do this work and again does this work

805
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,579
belongs in this group or should we go

806
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,619
somewhere else that's something that we

807
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,020
need to also figure out thank you let's

808
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,040
keep more time for questions

809
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,520
Charles

810
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,020
next slide

811
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,859
just says thanks

812
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:08,040
uh yeah Charles I called uh Cisco thanks

813
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,540
for the presentation I think it was it

814
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,700
was really good um

815
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,400
also spent some time in uh MEF and

816
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
working on sd-wan stuff over there and

817
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,619
we had a similar need for this

818
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:20,339
um

819
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,760
we didn't see any kind of General

820
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,520
purpose-like way of uh not just

821
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,260
classifying but indicating what the

822
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,839
classification was so we did like many

823
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:33,480
people do to find our own it is a bit

824
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,280
special purpose and that it's meant for

825
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,099
sd-wan applications where classifying

826
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,140
application traffic as it comes in is

827
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,220
very important

828
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,960
so what we did is we have a number of

829
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,460
things some of which you mentioned here

830
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,839
uh

831
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,839
based on IP address Port Source

832
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,000
destination of those uh and then we have

833
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,700
kind of a wild card of just you random

834
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,740
USI and an application ID because so

835
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,140
many people were using DPI you know some

836
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,079
type of special sauce to identify

837
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,180
uh traffic and the key thing was once

838
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,500
it's identified

839
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,540
then the customer at the sd-wan wants to

840
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,040
be able to say well this is how I want

841
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,300
you to treat it or these are the

842
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,920
important aspects for it

843
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,220
right so um anyways we have that I would

844
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,900
be happy to help people

845
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,660
you know see that see if it matches your

846
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,940
purpose or fits into this uh General

847
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,619
category of what you're looking to do

848
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:23,760
and

849
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
and kind of go from there

850
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,480
thank you please send me the link yeah

851
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,660
sure

852
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,359
I'll actually ask both of you if either

853
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,000
of you were in netmod this morning oh

854
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,060
gosh yes I wasn't there okay so if you

855
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,520
heard in netmod there is a discussion

856
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,960
talking about

857
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,040
um revising the ACL base model and it

858
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,800
seems like there's some Synergy here and

859
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,760
either you could uh do your work by

860
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,660
um further revision of ACL or an

861
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,180
augmentation of that new work at least

862
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,280
the classification part and that might

863
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,800
also apply to

864
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,420
Charles what you're talking about

865
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,220
so you might want to look at that

866
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,900
document and see whether or not there's

867
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,619
good synergy

868
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,359
if if I've misread and you're really

869
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,300
talking about more about routing policy

870
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,740
I'll remind you everyone that there's a

871
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,299
routing policy but I think yeah okay

872
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:29,720
so moving to the next is Pavan

873
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,280
I'll give a quick update on the data

874
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,839
model graph that discusses topology

875
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,240
filters and topology filter sets

876
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,500
uh this was uh initially presented in

877
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,420
itf112 there were some comments and

878
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,380
questions

879
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,079
raised we discussed those on the list

880
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,020
and an update was published addressing

881
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,640
those

882
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,480
just hold it

883
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,440
now

884
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,720
okay

885
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,440
uh this was introduced in itf112 there

886
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,880
were some questions and comments raised

887
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,339
we discussed those on the list there was

888
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,740
an update published uh addressing those

889
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,480
comments and I'll cover those changes in

890
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,760
the next couple of slides I'm pawn biram

891
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,740
and uh I'm presenting this on behalf of

892
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,560
my co-authoric Rakesh and shafen that's

893
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,740
right

894
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,140
uh the topology filter construct was uh

895
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,579
originally modeled as part of the

896
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,680
network resource partition policy data

897
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,380
model given its generic applicability we

898
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,520
published it as a standalone module uh

899
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,320
there were some questions about the

900
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,380
scope of this construct so we did add

901
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,180
some text and introduction clarifying

902
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,119
that uh it's a construct that's used to

903
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,220
filter Network topologies it can be

904
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,579
applied on either a native tier where

905
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,400
topology or a native or a customized ta

906
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,180
where topology as discussed in RSC 8795

907
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,099
application of this on a topology would

908
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,780
produce a filtered set of topological

909
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,240
elements uh topology filter set on the

910
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,960
other hand is just a union of multiple

911
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,760
proposal filters that can be applied in

912
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,359
tandem on a topology we also went ahead

913
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,880
and added a note to especially state

914
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,160
that this is used for filtering Network

915
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,560
topologies and not for filtering entries

916
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,900
in the real uh next one

917
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,839
next slide

918
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,040
they were uh there were also some

919
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,960
comments about uh potential use cases

920
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,359
for this uh so we went ahead and added a

921
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,980
section describing a couple of use cases

922
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,140
one has a specification of topology

923
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,119
associated with uh Network resource

924
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,579
partition the other is uh specification

925
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,920
of top of G related constraints for Te

926
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,839
path computation

927
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,300
um we did add a few examples for each of

928
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,460
these use cases those are listed in the

929
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,380
document and reproduced here on this

930
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,660
Slide the rest of the deck goes over the

931
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,400
model structure there hasn't been any

932
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
changes to it since the time we

933
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,859
presented last time uh so we uh I'll not

934
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:15,720
repeat that can we jump to the last

935
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,960
slide uh our next touch line the one

936
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,000
before

937
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,680
um at this point we are just requesting

938
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,500
further review and feedback uh this is

939
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,260
uh a prerequisite for the NRP policy

940
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,339
data model uh uh at the point where we

941
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,560
would uh claim that they're not people's

942
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,540
data model or the merge document that

943
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,760
goes alluding to earlier uh is ready for

944
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,940
adoption we will uh put in a request for

945
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,619
uh this to be constructed for adoption

946
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,920
as well

947
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,920
so I'm going to ask the same uh well

948
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,079
well

949
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,700
in one moment

950
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,140
um so I'm going to ask basically the

951
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,420
same question I asked at the last one

952
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,280
there were some comments that it was a

953
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,619
little confusing so this is gauging

954
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:07,040
interest it's not about adoption

955
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,180
and uh

956
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,160
you know raise hands if you're

957
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,260
interested in hearing more

958
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,240
know if you're not or you think the

959
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,579
draft is going in the wrong direction

960
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:19,800
and no response means don't care sorry

961
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,140
about the three state but that's that's

962
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,140
our pull tool and uh gee if you want to

963
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,859
ask your question

964
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,320
yeah from hallway actually uh my

965
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,180
question is uh I think there's a

966
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,599
topology future it's mainly applicable

967
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,500
to perform the T or centralized past

968
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,680
computation so you can use this filters

969
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,680
to as constraints to for the controller

970
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,960
or the Ingress node to compute the past

971
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,560
but whether it can apply to the

972
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,760
distributed past computation like you

973
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,660
use

974
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,300
can you apply to the multi-topology or

975
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,720
it can apply to the flasago it says

976
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,480
not that clear to me at a current moment

977
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,520
so I think it can be clarified further

978
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
in the doctor it can be we can add an

979
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,640
appendix with examples

980
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,260
all right we'll give just a few more

981
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,780
moments and the next speaker is going to

982
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,160
be uh

983
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,400
uh Greg

984
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,220
so uh we've had about a third of the

985
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,819
room respond it looks like uh slightly

986
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,880
more are interested than not uh but we

987
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,180
definitely got some good not interested

988
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,819
um so it's uh

989
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,319
the room is mixed but I'd say the

990
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:44,760
working group isn't convinced about this

991
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,339
work but still should hear more thank

992
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:49,520
you

993
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,460
uh you want to switch

994
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,940
are you

995
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,140
uh I'll switch sorry

996
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,619
thank you uh for um

997
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,859
granting the time uh to update you on uh

998
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,200
the work that uh being done in ittm

999
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,540
working group on uh Precision

1000
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,940
availability metrics in

1001
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,880
um uh multi-so will govern end-to-end

1002
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,680
Services next slide

1003
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,700
so um

1004
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,000
we had uh two groups of offers

1005
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,680
um

1006
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,500
interested in this problem and then we

1007
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,599
worked together to merge this into one

1008
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,000
document and

1009
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,660
um

1010
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,599
we had first working group adoption Pro

1011
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,079
in ittm working group and in the meeting

1012
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,000
earlier this week uh we agreed that

1013
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,599
um the version of the document that uh

1014
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,560
reflects uh comments that we received uh

1015
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,319
will be uploaded and uh their second

1016
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,300
working group adoption poll or

1017
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,920
continuation of the working group

1018
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,640
adoption poll uh will be announced uh

1019
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,740
why we are presenting to tears uh

1020
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,020
because we believe that uh this is

1021
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,760
important for traffic engineering and

1022
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,460
networks Rising operations and the TS

1023
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,800
working group has an expertise on those

1024
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,700
topics

1025
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,920
so uh we hope that it will get your

1026
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,819
interest and uh you will uh review this

1027
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,440
document and share your comments

1028
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,020
including on ipt and working group list

1029
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,960
thank you next slide

1030
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,400
so what is the problem

1031
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,579
um since slos uh composed of uh service

1032
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:54,599
level agreement they're the key and

1033
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:57,300
um they need to be considerate in many

1034
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,960
cases uh just one violation does not

1035
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,400
mean uh a lot so uh instead of keeping

1036
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,800
the history of all the measurements of

1037
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,560
all the raw data that are being

1038
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,760
collected uh for the given Service uh

1039
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,700
that can be

1040
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,819
aggregated and concentrating on when the

1041
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,380
service is

1042
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,060
um

1043
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,880
crossing the threshold

1044
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,540
so basically going out of their defined

1045
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,040
parameters acceptable for this given

1046
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,260
performance metric

1047
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,740
so capturing these violations uh or

1048
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,660
asserting the absence of a certain

1049
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,020
conformance to the SLO is sufficient to

1050
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,740
draw the conclusion of uh and assess the

1051
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,040
quality and conformance to the required

1052
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,500
SLO

1053
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,560
so uh there is analogy between the

1054
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,980
service and system failures and uh the

1055
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,119
failure is to be considered when um

1056
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,940
fail to deliver uh to the required

1057
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,839
um

1058
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,180
performance metric

1059
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,140
next slide please

1060
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,700
so what is

1061
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,119
um perform Precision adorability metric

1062
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,520
so it expresses availability of the

1063
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,839
service in accordance with the

1064
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,960
performance required reflected as is

1065
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,839
expressed as a service level objective

1066
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:34,500
and I would like to stress because uh as

1067
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,420
mentioned that we believe that this is

1068
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,240
very much applicable to work uh being

1069
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,180
done in tears on iitf transport Network

1070
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,060
slices uh we follow the terminology

1071
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,579
defined in

1072
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:51,660
um Network slices uh TS document

1073
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,920
and that uh both for SLO s uh service

1074
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,660
level expectation and service level

1075
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,800
agreement

1076
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,140
so the service level agreement because

1077
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,760
as defined and agreed upon that uh they

1078
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,060
are

1079
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,380
uh

1080
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:15,240
quantity well there are some um parts of

1081
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,140
uh SLA but they are difficult to measure

1082
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,540
so these are outside the scope of this

1083
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,720
work

1084
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,520
so the performance Squad uh requirements

1085
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,560
for various Network Services can be

1086
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,240
expressed through the combination of

1087
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,319
slos so thus uh the conformance of the

1088
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,040
service is the combination of uh each uh

1089
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:44,280
individual SLO that is uh a part of SLA

1090
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,359
next slide please

1091
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,500
sorry

1092
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,000
no that's fine

1093
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,420
so here we come uh to their composing

1094
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,480
service and as discussed uh in um

1095
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,980
ITF um Network slice uh document

1096
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,119
um

1097
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,920
composite service might include

1098
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,980
connectivity constructs so e uh all

1099
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,599
constructs may be assigned for um

1100
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:22,619
the same uh set of slos

1101
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:25,680
or some construct might be assigned a

1102
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,740
different sets of slots so in that case

1103
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,839
each connectivity construct that

1104
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,819
composes the service can be monitored

1105
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:36,839
according to its own set of slos then

1106
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,020
are there um

1107
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,099
Pam for their uh composite service will

1108
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:48,000
be a supposition of uh fams of these sub

1109
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,359
services

1110
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,160
foreign so uh if you have any questions

1111
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,260
so feel free to

1112
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,380
sorry uh well indicate and uh I think

1113
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,359
the chairs will bring it to my attention

1114
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,880
so we can have a discussion I think that

1115
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,520
it will be better if I will go all and

1116
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,380
then we have to rewind to the beginning

1117
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,300
of the presentation

1118
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,560
but let me continue next slide please

1119
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,380
so applicability uh where we think that

1120
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,560
we leave that pan can be used it could

1121
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,020
be useful in a determined degree of

1122
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,140
compliance uh which service levels are

1123
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,400
delivered relative to predefined slos

1124
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,400
and uh here what we envision that uh

1125
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,460
interest from operator perspective and

1126
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,160
from subscriber perspective could be

1127
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,880
different

1128
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,900
uh for example what we Define we Define

1129
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,300
uh the violation of SLO and severe

1130
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,619
violation so where their violation is uh

1131
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,720
probably more of interest to the an

1132
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,940
operator and it indicates the

1133
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,819
degradation or sufficient degradation of

1134
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,280
the particular performance metric

1135
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,660
uh

1136
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,940
Crossing some threshold

1137
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,660
uh but severe violation is the violation

1138
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,079
that crosses the critical threshold and

1139
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,319
that both may be of interest uh to

1140
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:16,200
operator and subscriber

1141
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,720
but again nothing prevents it having

1142
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,839
only uh one threshold which is a

1143
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,400
critical threshold

1144
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,319
uh so also

1145
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,119
um fam could be useful in providing

1146
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,700
service uh according to SLO as

1147
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,760
accounting records and assess

1148
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,460
um the quality with which uh service is

1149
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,000
deliberate and monitor it continuously

1150
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,839
next one please

1151
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,240
um again one of the foundation elements

1152
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,740
of Pam is the time unit Tamp unit so uh

1153
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,440
it is the unit on which their uh

1154
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,200
particular performance metric is big uh

1155
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,160
measured and then uh their conformers

1156
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,579
are to SLO being evaluated and expressed

1157
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:04,980
either it's a violated interval

1158
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,980
violation free interval or severe

1159
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,960
violation interval

1160
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,599
uh an example of time interval could be

1161
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,720
one second one millisecond or to the

1162
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,420
liking of uh

1163
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,300
um the user uh the only is that

1164
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,579
requirement and I I think it's logical

1165
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:28,920
that uh time interval for all slos that

1166
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,819
uh included in a given SLA should be the

1167
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:35,000
same

1168
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,020
um so

1169
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,900
uh based on this definition uh we Define

1170
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,319
their set of basic metrics which is a

1171
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:45,480
number of

1172
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,359
violation intervals violation three

1173
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,180
intervals and severe violation intervals

1174
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,020
but the number itself uh probably does

1175
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,680
not reflect uh the state of the uh

1176
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,920
particular Sol and service

1177
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,500
so next slide please

1178
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:10,380
so from that we have can have some

1179
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,920
derived parametrics uh that might be

1180
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,140
useful time since last violation

1181
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,420
integral mean time number of packets

1182
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,880
mean number of packets and that are

1183
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,520
applicable to both violation intervals

1184
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,680
and severe violation intervals next

1185
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,220
slide please

1186
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,300
and an extension so here's the probably

1187
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,180
might be the interesting part

1188
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,319
um

1189
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:41,160
the availability on availability of the

1190
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,520
service can be expressed uh based on the

1191
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,420
state and because the state has to be uh

1192
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,619
sticky

1193
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:53,220
so not to switch uh what we Define is

1194
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,280
that uh availability or unavailability

1195
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,520
States expressed as a lengthy

1196
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,880
and interrupted

1197
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,680
um

1198
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,260
continuous State whether it's a severe

1199
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,220
violation state or a violation L

1200
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,059
relation three intervals consecutive

1201
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:18,540
so for example it could be that

1202
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,819
10 consecutive severe violation

1203
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:23,520
intervals constitute the unavailability

1204
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,119
state that began at the beginning of the

1205
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,099
first interval

1206
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,079
are similarly

1207
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,339
uh 10 consecutive none

1208
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:36,960
severe violation intervals which is

1209
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,720
violation intervals or violation three

1210
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,140
intervals will constitute a transition

1211
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,640
to uh availability State beginning from

1212
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,579
the first non-svi you need to wrap up

1213
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,800
yeah next slide

1214
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,680
uh we're getting there I think you need

1215
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,440
to be last slide yeah so we have some

1216
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,319
discussion items and some future work

1217
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:03,599
out uh

1218
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,420
uh indicated it's in the document we

1219
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,400
welcome cooperation next slide

1220
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,619
of course okay as mentioned uh please uh

1221
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:19,200
read the document share your comments on

1222
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,900
ittm working list I'm sorry we don't

1223
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,520
have time for it also this is

1224
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,040
informational please take your comments

1225
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,579
to the ippm working group thank you no I

1226
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,920
I TSN working sorry

1227
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,319
um

1228
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,859
Gabrielle

1229
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:40,980
yes thank you can you help me yes you

1230
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,640
sound great okay thank you okay next

1231
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,240
slide please

1232
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,440
so this uh

1233
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,500
just an overview on the motivation of uh

1234
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,420
this draft as we know uh the networks

1235
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,220
are uh layering and then

1236
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,160
there is the need to manage the the full

1237
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,940
Network and Independence of the layers

1238
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,720
and then uh I think uh a great job a

1239
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,800
great job has been done by Act mpy

1240
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,420
applicability

1241
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,319
but

1242
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:26,220
recently we see the new pluggable

1243
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,339
interface the dwm interface is coming on

1244
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:33,680
the market and moving for example the

1245
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,920
what is the transponder like

1246
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,099
functions from the optical layer to the

1247
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:43,280
IP layer so that

1248
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,079
this open a number of use cases because

1249
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,119
actually

1250
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,579
a part of the optical components are in

1251
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,520
a different layer than the optical layer

1252
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,859
and so

1253
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:06,059
in theory the the Deployable should be

1254
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:10,859
managed by the the packet controlling

1255
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:13,619
instead of optical controller on the

1256
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:16,319
other side the optical controller needs

1257
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,400
to know what kind of uh

1258
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,740
transceiver or what kind of pluggable

1259
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,460
has been fitted in the router and then

1260
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,700
this is used to make the optical

1261
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,740
verification and all that stuff

1262
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,000
next please

1263
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,760
okay in other words this is the network

1264
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,700
topology we are addressing no so we have

1265
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,119
the packet Network element with the P1

1266
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,940
P2 P3 which are the plugable dwdm

1267
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,520
pluggable we have the optical Network

1268
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,640
and then so we have sort of mix and

1269
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,140
match

1270
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,400
next next please

1271
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,800
to address this uh kind of uh Network as

1272
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,339
you can see we we are adopting we we are

1273
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:11,700
not making anything new acts solution is

1274
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,880
the good one where we have an

1275
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,700
hierarchical controller which is a mdsc

1276
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,579
and connected to the hierarchical

1277
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:23,579
controller we have the packet PNC and

1278
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:27,000
the optical PNC of course in some way

1279
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,599
the packet PNC and the optical PNC needs

1280
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:33,540
to share some information related to the

1281
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,940
to the pluggable

1282
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,839
next one

1283
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,760
thank you so the service can be either

1284
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,619
dco link so it's a pure

1285
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:51,900
Optical circuit if you want that is by

1286
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,799
the way the terminated on the routers

1287
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,920
there are uh some interlayer link to be

1288
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,160
defined between the router port and the

1289
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Rotom ports and then on top of that we

1290
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,799
have Internet

1291
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:11,220
services IP services and whatever and of

1292
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:15,420
course is a matter of mdsc to manage all

1293
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:20,280
this stuff tank helping the packet and

1294
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,859
the optical PNC

1295
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,880
next one

1296
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,540
so basically in the draft we have been

1297
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:34,920
identified identify a bunch of use cases

1298
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,660
that they don't want to go one by one

1299
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,520
but basically the matter is to identify

1300
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,380
the Interlink connections first and then

1301
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,940
each

1302
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,460
controller so domain controller can

1303
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,700
share with the mdsc the network topology

1304
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,760
the layer of topology and the mdsc will

1305
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,720
rebuild the full Network topology

1306
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,200
at that point mdsc can manage and can

1307
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
drive end-to-end services

1308
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,440
or that can be done at IP level or can

1309
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,319
that can be done at Optical layer

1310
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:20,760
or also driver Restorations and so on

1311
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,540
these are actually described in details

1312
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,500
in the draft so I would like you to uh

1313
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,700
to have a look to the to the draft and

1314
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,160
then feedback

1315
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,558
feed the feedback next one

1316
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,559
so next step is actually to address the

1317
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:48,059
use case but also to add a new one like

1318
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,040
for for example end-to-end Performance

1319
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,420
Management along correlation and and not

1320
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,960
only this one because I feel there are

1321
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,680
many other use case to cover and to to

1322
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,660
to address

1323
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,500
in order to let's say uh

1324
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,900
help the the

1325
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,359
operator the network operators to

1326
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:16,619
support this kind of network topology of

1327
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:19,380
course so we want to keep align this

1328
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,559
draft with the the httmp poi

1329
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,119
applicability

1330
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,540
and then get feedbacks and consensus

1331
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,220
from the team so especially the

1332
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,380
feedbacks because this is quite

1333
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,619
important point the technology is

1334
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:36,660
running fast the deployment of the

1335
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,359
pluggable in the field is running very

1336
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:43,980
fast more than expected probably and

1337
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,059
then so we need to address this point

1338
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:51,660
last but not least we would like also to

1339
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,440
help the young models definition

1340
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,180
we don't think for the moment that the

1341
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,119
model will be defined in this draft but

1342
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:03,180
we should identify the good one already

1343
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,299
existing in other draft and maybe ask to

1344
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:09,720
the other draft to add new models

1345
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,660
okay that that's all

1346
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,980
thank you thank you for your time

1347
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,359
did you consider uh

1348
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,339
putting I mean discussing this as part

1349
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,920
of the working group adopted document

1350
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,119
just

1351
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:32,660
let's say uh we we as you know we have a

1352
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:39,059
design team on httmpy I would ask the

1353
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:41,400
design team also to discuss about this

1354
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,400
draft and then I don't know

1355
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,540
um

1356
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,180
this is zero zero it's a brand new draft

1357
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,920
so I wouldn't expect to have uh now

1358
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,359
weekly meetings and then report back to
