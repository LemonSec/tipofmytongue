1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,920
foreign

2
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,080
let's get started here

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,900
this is sedate

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,000
if you intended to be someplace else

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,340
you're very welcome here

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,409
[Music]

7
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,800
let's see here

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,640
suddenly

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,200
let me try this here

10
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,160
that's all right yeah yeah

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,299
okay let's try this again

12
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,840
thank you

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,960
that looks good okay uh the usual note

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
well

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,720
um it's a small enough type that

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
um it'll be hard to read but it's

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
something that you probably are aware of

18
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
from every other working group

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,939
that you've been to so I won't spend a

20
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,740
lot of time on that

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,240
uh

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,759
there's some basic meeting tips here if

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,939
this is your first time there is uh in

24
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,640
the uh

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,079
ietf 115 agenda there is a link to our

26
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,520
working group and uh it has

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,799
on the right hand side a link to the

28
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,840
on-site tool

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,220
um that's the one you should probably

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,820
use uh that also does the job of

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,560
automatically signing the blue sheets

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
for you and we do have some remote

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,439
participants I see so that's great

34
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,140
um we'll make sure and keep an eye on

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,199
the queue as we go along

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,260
uh in terms of resources for this ietf

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,500
meeting uh the agenda is on data tracker

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,840
uh meet echo of course is what you're

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,120
using to participate

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,700
um uh there is zulup we've sort of moved

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,680
to zulup as the

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,160
uh instant mesh messaging Tool uh and

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,739
there's of course uh the chat room

44
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,440
associated with meet Echo and we'll keep

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,520
an eye on that as well

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,160
um in terms of resources

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,040
um here are the usual ones uh Braun is

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,920
going to start putting notes uh in the

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,040
notepad that's great the mailing list is

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,959
right there

51
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,540
um enough about that

52
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,540
here's our agenda this is the simplest

53
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,540
agenda that we could possibly have uh

54
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,840
we're basically here to see whether or

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,260
not we've made enough progress on the

56
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,580
sedate draft

57
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,920
and Karsten will take us through that

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,159
and we'll see if there are any remaining

59
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,379
outstanding issues otherwise Braun and I

60
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,080
uh be doing an assessment

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,099
um

62
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,200
we're supposed to do it tomorrow as a

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,340
matter of fact

64
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,220
if we need it we can talk about the

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,700
liaison that we have to

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,260
tc1454

67
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,879
I'm not sure we need that but we can

68
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,680
decide as we go along

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,220
and so with that uh we come to the end

70
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,340
of my prepared remarks

71
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,720
and

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,599
um we're going to give the presentation

73
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,299
to Kirsten

74
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,319
let's see here

75
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,840
there

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,260
and I can run the slides for you or

77
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,080
okay you can use that thing I think you

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,860
might be able to use that

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,720
oh well that's impossible as it turns

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,139
out yeah

81
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,220
okay thank you so this is a pretty

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,600
illustrious

83
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,479
Community today but

84
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,540
we will go on YouTube so it's worth

85
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,000
doing this

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,759
so this is really the only slide I

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,520
uh need to show

88
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,340
um because we are pretty much done

89
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,520
and the document has

90
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,680
converged

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,199
surprisingly

92
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,240
we found a problem with the document

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,520
that we were supposed to build on

94
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,699
we go into some more details

95
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,240
and added a fix to that

96
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
through the document even though we

97
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,680
promised that we were not going to touch

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,840
our best documents so that's really the

99
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,960
interesting part today

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,020
and so we also found out that it is

101
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,120
really hard to discuss this problem

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,580
next slide

103
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,240
so uh just to remind everyone what

104
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,360
RFC 3339 is

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,699
this is essentially

106
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,600
described

107
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,560
by this

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,419
data model here

109
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,820
an RC 5339 date

110
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,800
has a UTC time

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,560
and optionally a local office

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,300
that's the whole data content of the

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,380
thing

114
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,580
and uh well that was defined

115
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,039
around the year 2000

116
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,620
essentially the profile of

117
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,419
ISO 8601 that we all love dearly

118
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,720
so they used actually the 1988 version

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,460
for that

120
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,940
one could argue that they didn't quite

121
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,919
provide it right but

122
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,080
that's maybe not that important there

123
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,039
was a 2000 version of 8601 and that's

124
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,479
even cited by 239 so let's uh think

125
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,520
about that

126
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,780
so um I'm noticing that uh when you look

127
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,639
at the characters

128
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,460
you don't necessarily see a UDC time so

129
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,979
when there is a local offset the UTC

130
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,680
time is encoded based on that local

131
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,740
offset but the data model view of of

132
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,960
this data is that you always have a UTC

133
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,600
time and you actually have a local

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,220
offset

135
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,199
so uh

136
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,780
there are no floating times or anything

137
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,900
like that no calendaring times

138
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,400
this is just a time stamp on the udg UTC

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
time scale uh

140
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,100
plus optionally the local offset

141
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,660
a hint

142
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,720
and the reason why that that is given

143
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,259
for using the Oracle offset is that this

144
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,660
is often useful information

145
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,020
so how do you indicate that you are not

146
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,060
providing a local offset when you're

147
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,080
generating

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,080
and Roc 339 timestamp

149
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,400
you use negative zero as your local

150
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,680
offset

151
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,259
so that is going to be important in the

152
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,380
next issue besides things like this

153
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,560
so what's the date actually does

154
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,180
is extending 359 timestamps

155
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,819
um so you can add additional

156
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,240
hints just like the local offset hinge

157
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,840
is a hinge there are other hints and in

158
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,360
particular there is a way to indicate

159
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,919
the time zone

160
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,259
so the local offset only tells you how

161
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,039
many hours you are west or east of

162
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,340
UTC why the time zone actually tells you

163
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
which

164
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,259
political construct

165
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,380
uh you are referencing to to arrive at

166
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,660
that local offset so for instance Europe

167
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,039
Berlin right now is plus one

168
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,539
uh but uh in summer it's plus two so uh

169
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,759
the the time zone information is a hint

170
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,360
that is added but it doesn't change the

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,659
uh content which is still a UDC

172
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,039
timestamp

173
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,860
we also have ways to add keys

174
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,820
for other options and as an example we

175
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,700
put in the calendar type

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,860
which again is a hinge and not changing

177
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,959
the base semantics

178
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,560
of the timestamp and we can even

179
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,440
identify options as critical as much

180
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,080
must understand

181
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,880
um I we don't have an example for that

182
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,820
in in the document right now but that's

183
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,860
easy to see how that

184
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,660
would work

185
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,779
okay so this is all really not very

186
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,779
complicated it's not rocket science and

187
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,880
our main job was to make sure that this

188
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,740
works well

189
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,740
with various existing

190
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,080
and uh in standardization

191
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,440
interfaces to timestamp libraries that

192
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
we want to make sure people can continue

193
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,160
to use

194
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,060
next slide

195
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,339
so yeah

196
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,459
this should be my last slide

197
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:47,820
unfortunately next slide it's not quite

198
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,399
as simple next slide

199
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,459
um so the the problem is

200
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,440
that

201
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,000
roc-339 defines

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,060
the ISO 8601z

203
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,120
suffix and the plus zero zero colon zero

204
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
zero as synonyms for a local offset

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,100
hinge of zero minutes so you are on UTC

206
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,920
but you are not only on UTC this is the

207
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,980
you're telling the recipient that uh for

208
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,720
instance the person who generated this

209
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,899
timestamp actually uses the local offset

210
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,660
to convert the UTC time into their local

211
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,640
uh thinking

212
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,519
and to opt out of giving that

213
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,220
information again we have minus zero

214
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,959
zero colon zero zero

215
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,220
that means no local offset a given and

216
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,580
this minus zero zero zero zero was

217
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,380
essentially imported from RFC 822 or

218
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,480
actually to a22 which is the first

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,880
version of the email standards that

220
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,899
actually

221
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:57,240
uh documents this so in uh email date

222
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,940
may contain this minus zero zero colon

223
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,200
zero zero

224
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
and that is actually in use it's not

225
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,100
like

226
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,180
uh 30 of the mails so how have that I

227
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,279
did a quick check on a small repository

228
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,800
of emails million or so

229
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,180
um I had and I found like

230
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,680
0.3 percent I don't remember the number

231
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,300
but it was

232
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,240
uh not nothing but it also wasn't an

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,660
overwhelming majority of emails

234
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,000
using that but at least that's in use so

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,060
it's good that that email has that

236
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,760
so people can for instance indicate that

237
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,640
this email

238
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,440
originated from a place

239
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,660
that simply has no idea what the the

240
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,360
user who was ultimately responsible for

241
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,660
the email being generated users as their

242
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,000
local offset

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,100
now uh the RLC 5339 implementations

244
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,040
actually

245
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,680
uh generally don't deal

246
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,480
with minus zero zero colon zero zero

247
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,100
uh some of them actually follow the the

248
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,579
words of iso 8601 and don't allow that

249
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,040
that is actually rare but most never

250
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,000
generate this

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,640
because 8601

252
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,700
in this 2000 version not in in its 1988

253
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,300
version but in its 2000 version

254
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,660
suddenly started to disallow minus zero

255
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,260
zero colon zero zero so since people who

256
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,140
write JavaScript implementations or

257
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,040
other programming language

258
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,420
implementations

259
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,060
often look at isil standards in parallel

260
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,139
to

261
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,940
the the profiles we generate here they

262
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,459
decided not to write that number

263
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:56,420
so in practice

264
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,680
they wouldn't have a way to actually

265
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,959
indicate no local offset being given

266
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,440
but the reality is that

267
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,899
all implementations that don't deal in

268
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,339
time zone offsets

269
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,860
so what would really have to use this

270
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,959
minus0000

271
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,740
all those implementations use Z

272
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,000
as the suffix because that's short

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,980
and other implementations that actually

274
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,620
do have the information

275
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,339
uh have tended to give Zed as the

276
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,320
indication that no local offset has been

277
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,760
given and plus zero zero colon zero zero

278
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,579
as the local offset 0.

279
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,720
so we have uh an interoperability

280
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,980
problem

281
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,560
between implementations

282
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,620
that Implement through this resign

283
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,399
and implementations that Implement what

284
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,440
other implementations Implement what the

285
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,300
majority of implementations out there

286
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,959
Implement so this is based on a survey

287
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,139
that Justin Grant did then which can we

288
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,200
find in one of the issues of the sea

289
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,540
date Repository

290
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,880
so next slide

291
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,740
what do we do about that

292
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,660
um well there is a the whole issue of

293
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,820
handling conflicts for instance between

294
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,040
time zone information and

295
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,880
uh information that is uh

296
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,800
in the the original uh RC 539

297
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,700
um I think we have that correctly uh

298
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,120
covered so we know how to handle that

299
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,980
except for the problem on the previous

300
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,899
slide next slide

301
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,500
and uh the the result

302
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,459
that didn't take oh uh the result is

303
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,540
that we essentially now have two

304
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,420
problems uh there are two options we can

305
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,399
ignore the problem

306
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,260
feign ignorance

307
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,860
and just add our our optional suffixes

308
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,120
and act as if nobody uh

309
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,180
uh nothing will miss oh that's something

310
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,399
very good or we can do the right thing

311
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,540
and uh the the discussion on the list

312
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,540
went into preferably doing the right

313
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,519
thing next slide

314
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,339
and uh so

315
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,480
the radical proposal is that we actually

316
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,180
start to interpret Z

317
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,519
as minus

318
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,100
zero zero zero zero

319
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,360
so that means no local offset is implied

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,940
so if you want to imply a local offset

321
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,699
of British winter time

322
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,880
then you write plus zero zero colon zero

323
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,100
zero

324
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,519
um so this happens to mirror the

325
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,040
consensus in the implementations so this

326
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,199
would essentially just be adjusting the

327
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,480
specification uh to what the

328
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,800
implementations do

329
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,139
but it goes outside the charter of

330
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,980
sedate because we were not supposed to

331
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,220
actually modify uh 539

332
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,279
so uh we thought maybe we need a little

333
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,980
bit of discussion beyond the sedate

334
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,560
working group Next slide

335
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,839
so I sent an email about a month ago

336
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,639
two five

337
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,459
working groups or actually art is not a

338
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,199
working Uber artist the discussion list

339
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,740
of the area to which sedate belongs to

340
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,959
in the ietf

341
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,060
applications in real time

342
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,120
and the forwarding of sedate sibo and JP

343
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,620
and tick tock

344
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,620
now the reason that sibo ntp and Tick

345
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,380
Tock are on there is that they are also

346
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,779
doing something with time

347
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,759
and they probably need to know what's

348
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,740
going on now Tick Tock is is kind of

349
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,440
closing right now so this this maybe

350
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,660
wasn't that necessary

351
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,179
ntp is

352
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,640
uh in the process of

353
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,980
essentially making up their mind of what

354
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,859
should be an ntp version 5 and there is

355
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,520
actually some some discussion about

356
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,299
having a time zone aware version of

357
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,619
ntp and to be normally isn't just about

358
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,980
UTC so they they wouldn't care

359
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,260
um but that may influence their

360
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,700
discussion so I thought it might be good

361
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,380
to include them

362
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,360
uh sibo has a Time tag which is a binary

363
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,140
data structure that is supposed to be

364
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,860
compatible with other representations of

365
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,919
time so of course it should provide a

366
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,679
binary version of the sedate extensions

367
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
which it does

368
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,360
and of course see date because we

369
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,480
detected the problem next slide

370
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,179
now it turns out when you bring up this

371
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,559
problem problem

372
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,720
then people start first of all

373
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,120
discussing whether we should be

374
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,120
referencing ISO 8601 at all

375
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,440
which is

376
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,660
not irrelevant to this working group

377
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,600
because that was a decision done by 539

378
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
but still there was a lot of discussion

379
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,100
in the thread about whether we should

380
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,500
reference non-free uh standards

381
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,820
normative

382
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,740
okay irrelevant

383
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,440
there also was a discussion about the

384
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,280
need for floating time so floating times

385
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,559
are different from the the

386
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,020
Z times

387
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,780
that I have been talking about these are

388
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,980
times

389
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,500
where you don't know

390
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,900
what the local offset is but also don't

391
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,799
know how the the time you're looking at

392
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,039
uh relates to UTC

393
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,320
so the only thing in a floating time is

394
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,679
you know it's 1400

395
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,860
um afternoon but you you don't know uh

396
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,840
what that means in UTC and that's

397
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,460
strictly outside of the scope of this

398
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,900
work group because we started with the

399
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,280
UTC time

400
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,000
uh representation 539 so yeah it's an

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,559
interesting discussion

402
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,440
uh but uh

403
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,780
maybe not that relevant

404
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,820
there also was a discussion about sub

405
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,340
manage time zone offset

406
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,020
so uh the Netherlands in 1923 had a time

407
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,140
zone offset from Germany that was

408
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,280
something something plus 23 seconds

409
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,160
um yeah that's certainly interesting but

410
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,500
it's not something that that really

411
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,840
impacts uh date and time implementations

412
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,760
that we use today

413
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,940
so nobody has submitted time zone

414
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,919
offered offsets

415
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,340
in use for things that happen

416
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,280
to to matter for Commerce

417
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,440
so we can ignore that as well

418
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,240
then people brought up calendaring

419
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,720
issues what if I do a if I plan a

420
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
meeting next year

421
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,100
uh in the summer

422
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,400
and say well it's supposed to be 1400

423
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,840
afternoon

424
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,760
and uh then my government goes ahead and

425
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,340
finally implements the decision to get

426
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,380
rid of daylight savings time or

427
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,700
summertime

428
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,660
uh yeah then what happens to my meeting

429
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,820
the UTC

430
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,360
timestamp I might have computed for that

431
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,000
meeting it's no longer going to be right

432
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,059
so I will see

433
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,620
53.90 really wasn't the right standard

434
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,760
to represent

435
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,520
uh that in any case so this is about

436
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,860
calendaring times and not about

437
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,400
time stamping uh information in a way

438
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,580
that is unambiguely referenced to

439
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,179
uh UDC so again relevant and of course

440
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,480
you can then from there go into tangents

441
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,460
on unstable politicians and times or

442
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,100
definitions and yes that has happened in

443
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,539
this thread

444
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,280
so

445
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,799
so after reading the whole thread

446
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,820
I'm none the wiser except maybe the fact

447
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,600
that these five things came up and not

448
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,679
really uh criticism of making the change

449
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,780
or making the change that that we are

450
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,179
intending to make here shows me that

451
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,860
this isn't

452
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,860
really big problem apparently

453
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,879
so next slide

454
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,679
so my

455
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,440
recommendation would be to consider the

456
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,760
discussion done

457
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,580
at this point

458
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,980
check with the every director and with

459
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,679
the ADHD in general

460
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,080
whether we can go beyond our Charter

461
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,280
which probably means we will have to

462
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,860
change our charger

463
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,080
to actually fix Roc 539 in this context

464
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,480
which by the way I think is a useful

465
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,340
outcome so aligning our

466
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,919
documentation of how a timestamp

467
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,559
implementation should work with what we

468
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,400
people are actually doing out there is a

469
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,200
useful thing to do completely

470
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,860
independent of our Charter of adding

471
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,780
additional hints to these timestamps

472
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,299
so this is where we are

473
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,780
and I was hoping to actually use

474
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,659
uh the time here to get at least an

475
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,640
in-room conclusion of this again we have

476
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,460
to verify anything on the mailing lists

477
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,940
uh that we do in the ietf and we have to

478
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,380
talk with the

479
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,600
ad I don't think there is an ID in the

480
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,500
room

481
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
there's an ID online oh good

482
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,780
so let's open the discussion in ritual

483
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,100
go ahead Audra

484
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,880
all right you seem to be on mute here

485
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,799
it doesn't seem to have a sound switched

486
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,918
on yeah

487
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,559
first of all can you turn your audio on

488
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,240
hello does that work hello this is

489
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,620
excellent

490
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,580
well I I hate technology okay uh well

491
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,780
apologies I I had one question uh maybe

492
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,000
not just for Carson but for the entire

493
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,120
room uh when we were starting out with

494
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,900
this work uh sort of pre-sedate

495
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,240
chartering and everything

496
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,600
there were Ambitions initially to uh

497
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,120
sort of revamp three to three nine right

498
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,539
there were a few other things like uh

499
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,480
you know extended years and so on that

500
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,659
that could be done back then uh

501
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,240
all of those faced a lot of resistance

502
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,559
uh

503
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,980
and and in the end uh we decided to go

504
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,419
with this sort of more conservative

505
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,760
approach of leaving 389 as is uh what

506
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,940
I'm trying to say here is that I while

507
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,120
I'm completely with you that uh you know

508
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,799
the I'm sorry

509
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,580
uh that the charter sort of restricts us

510
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,820
I I do have to remind that there is a

511
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,460
reason why the charter is explicit on

512
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,380
this thing

513
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,159
so uh if we decide to

514
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,980
sort of uh you know recharge it today

515
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,880
and and move ahead with with this I hope

516
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,860
that we can reach a conclusion as a

517
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,080
working group that the change we're

518
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,440
talking about here does warrant

519
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,559
uh sort of that change and and uh

520
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,320
that we wouldn't receive further

521
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,520
pushback uh

522
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,980
yeah that that's all

523
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,140
okay I think um

524
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,720
uh I understand that Francisco's in the

525
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,159
queue

526
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,360
um go ahead Francesca

527
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,720
let's see if this works

528
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,220
well it does work

529
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,760
okay great yes I was going to say

530
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,960
it was just said

531
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,360
that

532
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,460
[Laughter]

533
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,419
that's our youngest engineer

534
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,779
kill it let's train again sorry about

535
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:13,740
that as you can hear I'm Not Alone

536
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,460
um I was going to say that yes this this

537
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,159
starter was

538
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,100
crafted with a lot of attention and um

539
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,380
and it was a very

540
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,580
um

541
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,880
it was a compromise to get to to to this

542
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,779
text

543
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,340
so any modification to this Charter will

544
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,919
require a lot of work to get consensus

545
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,299
from the community

546
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,159
and

547
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,360
um while I understand that

548
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,678
fixing things is

549
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,679
um

550
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,980
it's obviously very appealing but we

551
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,100
need to have a community consensus that

552
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,900
uh

553
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,720
agreement on what we're fixing and the

554
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,720
scope and the use case and everything so

555
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,240
it's not as simple as saying let's

556
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,700
extend the charter and

557
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,260
um and get this done

558
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,700
and I we are I see 17 people in the

559
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,140
meeting today I know that this meeting

560
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,760
collided with media man uh media man and

561
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,260
so

562
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,919
I think that a big part of the

563
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,559
uh the resistance that was there during

564
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,679
the initial Charter discussion uh people

565
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,240
were not are not present right now so

566
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,220
um I'm just catching up with the thread

567
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,720
I don't know if this was discussed in

568
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,000
the mailing list

569
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,919
uh but I think that we should have a

570
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,179
consensus to to do any sort of

571
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,980
retartering

572
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,720
and then if there is consensus of course

573
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,700
I will support it and bring it to the

574
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,100
history and move forward with it but the

575
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,240
first thing is

576
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,880
you know getting consensus in the

577
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,059
community

578
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,940
yeah can I quickly reply to that

579
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,260
um so the the purpose of the October 4th

580
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,520
uh mayor was to find out whether there

581
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,940
would be such resistance of course I

582
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,340
don't know that everybody who would be

583
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,200
resisting this is on the art mailing

584
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,159
list

585
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,260
or actually reads this or actually

586
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,200
replies to what they read so this is

587
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,860
hard to assess but I was surprised that

588
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,179
there were no

589
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,200
uh there was no discussion uh that

590
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,140
really questioned what we were trying to

591
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,120
do there were some misunderstandings of

592
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,740
what we were trying to do so I think

593
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,960
these were corrected

594
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,440
um but once they were I think yeah

595
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,559
people just went off those five targets

596
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,179
that I listed so my assessment is that

597
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,020
uh we don't have a strong opposition

598
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,240
against that

599
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,760
um but yeah I'm not sure in the pay

600
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,620
grade to actually make this assessment

601
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:12,539
before before I call on Brian here let

602
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,539
me use Chair say that I think we need to

603
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:16,799
be very clear that we're talking about

604
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,260
two things right we have an existing

605
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,020
sedate document that

606
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,539
um are the working

607
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:27,360
that the working group has and that's

608
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,120
currently in last claw and then there is

609
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,659
this problem which certainly the working

610
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,760
group could document

611
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,380
um

612
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,299
yeah right right

613
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:42,299
um and use that documentation as a

614
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:48,179
mechanism to support the ad as a

615
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,440
background to re-chartering so I I guess

616
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,480
what I'm thinking here is that the

617
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
working group has two tasks

618
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,059
excuse me number one

619
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,700
decision about the existing document and

620
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,080
number two

621
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,360
um a revision

622
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,220
3339 bits or whatever we want to call

623
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,919
that so Brian go ahead sorry to

624
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,720
interrupt that's okay thank you

625
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,600
um my memory of the discussion to start

626
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,200
off with about changing RSC 3339 was

627
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
that people didn't want anything which

628
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,440
would make the wire format backwards

629
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,240
incompatible in any way that was the

630
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,279
concern if we did something that meant

631
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,260
that existing passes broke the nice

632
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,820
thing about this change is all we are

633
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,580
doing is saying You must not generate

634
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,380
one particular form

635
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,000
so we're not adding anything that will

636
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,500
break existing parsers I think that's

637
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,960
why there hasn't been any pushback my

638
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,960
suggestion without any chair hats on is

639
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
that this document published saying must

640
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,120
not generate that particular form

641
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,620
and that we've identified this problem

642
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,559
with RSA 3309 and then ignore that for

643
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,059
this document we publish this document

644
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,220
and then we asked to reach out with a

645
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,380
specific task of just fixing that one

646
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,779
thing with 3339 and nothing else

647
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,760
I think there will be no difficulty

648
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,740
getting consensus on that change

649
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,640
uh thanks Brian I I wonder not to put

650
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,860
you on the spot Francesca but if you

651
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,299
have any reaction to that as a path

652
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,600
forward

653
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,720
it was rude of me to put you on the spot

654
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
okay she just might have noise

655
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,379
noisy shoot locally

656
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,980
we don't hear Francesca

657
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,700
yeah we still can't hear you

658
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,720
let's see now

659
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,640
um it's fine yep

660
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,159
great so yeah my preference would also

661
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,100
be to finish the current work and then

662
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,940
um focus on possible retardering

663
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,659
um but again I'm still catching up so

664
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,419
my opinion might change after

665
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,279
looking into the details of the mail

666
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,000
thread and

667
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,980
yeah so maybe I should remind people

668
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,340
that the actual approach that is in the

669
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,899
current document

670
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:22,740
is not to do a 639 base I don't see a

671
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,080
reason to do that

672
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,440
um but to actually just provide an

673
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,720
update to a 639

674
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,500
so the RFC resulting from this process

675
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,320
would have a tag on it which says it

676
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,059
updates the three nine

677
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,779
and the metadata for 339 would say this

678
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:46,080
is updated by the current document

679
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,539
and to the the uh only update here would

680
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,520
be juggling these three

681
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,140
uh time zone excuse me local offset uh

682
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,179
hence Z plus zero and minus uh zero

683
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:07,559
so I know that uh we are we have an

684
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,299
urgent problem in our hands

685
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,120
that in about 8 000 years this will no

686
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,679
longer work

687
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,019
uh but maybe we have a little bit more

688
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:19,380
time to fix that uh part

689
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,380
and the the intention here was to make

690
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,380
sure that we have a common format for

691
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,059
libraries like temporal and the

692
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:31,019
JavaScript support that is being put in

693
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,200
by ecmar tc39

694
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,059
and so on that provides a common basis

695
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,539
for the syntax extension that that

696
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,100
people need

697
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,820
foreign

698
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,640
okay well with a lot of people who are

699
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,320
participating remotely let me take a

700
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,580
moment here and see if there are any

701
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,360
other comments

702
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,500
uh one thing is that if you do go ahead

703
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,940
and fix RFC 3339 to to take the

704
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,359
terminology that Customs using we should

705
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,760
probably think about

706
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,980
um

707
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,399
uh early Ace with isil as well

708
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,359
yeah and we we also talk to other people

709
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,000
like tc39

710
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,339
um we currently have informal contacts

711
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,599
into that organization that's really the

712
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,659
reason why we have even detected this

713
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,159
problem because because we have

714
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,219
exercised these informal contracts

715
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,280
yeah I mean the the um the iso committee

716
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,040
is is sort of

717
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,859
wrapping up I mean I got into it very

718
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,359
late they'd already almost finished

719
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,680
there's a couple of points that I was

720
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,560
going to raise about their last minute

721
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,480
decisions but

722
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,700
um if we put together a message I can

723
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,420
always

724
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,460
um

725
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,619
pass it across and see what happens

726
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,579
yeah no maybe also should point out that

727
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:20,339
what we are fixing here is not things

728
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:24,060
that we have imported from 8601

729
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,599
but what we're fixing is our own

730
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,859
interpretation of

731
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,400
there being a difference between two

732
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,140
representations that mean the same thing

733
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,680
in 8601 and adding a third one that is

734
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,980
not supported by 8601 so from from the

735
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,560
point of view of

736
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,040
tc154 uh we are getting more compliance

737
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,160
which probably they should be like

738
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,560
yeah I don't know that it's something

739
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,240
that affects the h601

740
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,480
okay any other comments or questions

741
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,980
let me sum up what I think I've heard

742
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,200
this is dangerous

743
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,140
I think first of all uh the existing

744
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,780
sedate document is in last call that

745
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,579
last call ends tomorrow

746
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,800
I haven't heard at our meeting today any

747
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
objections to moving that document

748
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,160
forward

749
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,720
and so I'm going to just stop for a

750
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,520
moment and listen if there are any last

751
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,920
minute objections

752
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,740
okay that part's good

753
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,660
second thing I've heard is that perhaps

754
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,220
and this is my interpretation of what

755
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,320
I've heard the chair should work with

756
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,839
the ad the responsible ad

757
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,599
to start the discussion about a very

758
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,880
conservative re-chartering

759
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,119
for sedate to take care of the problem

760
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,320
in 3339

761
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,520
emphasizing what the cause of the

762
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,859
problem is what the solution to the

763
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,800
problem proposed is what the use cases

764
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,420
are and and basically maybe even uh go

765
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,520
to the list with

766
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,400
um proposed Charter text

767
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,859
so that's the second thing I've heard

768
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,079
the third thing I've heard is that if we

769
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,280
do that

770
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,300
we should communicate to ISO that number

771
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,820
one we found the problem it's our Pro

772
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,920
it's a problem that's associated with us

773
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,740
it's not our interpretation

774
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,099
of of the Isis standard and but we

775
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,619
should in the spirit of liaising with

776
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,839
other standards organizations we should

777
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,820
communicate that to them

778
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,380
those are the three things I've heard

779
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,940
have I missed anything missed anything

780
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,160
Carson is nodding his head

781
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,180
okay

782
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,098
I feel like we have consensus

783
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,940
all right

784
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,500
so what you can expect next is uh the

785
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,339
working group working group last call

786
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:07,380
ends tomorrow

787
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,060
um and at that point the chairs will

788
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,099
have a conversation

789
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,680
uh the second thing is that the chairs

790
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,040
will have a conversation with Francesca

791
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,680
to talk about

792
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,820
um

793
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,400
the process of extending or changing the

794
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,980
charter in this conservative way

795
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,200
uh and then we can start the work on

796
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,079
moving that forward uh this winter long

797
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,240
before we go to Japan

798
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,760
that's what I'd like to do is that if we

799
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,619
are going to pursue

800
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,560
revising the charter I'd like to have

801
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,380
that process underway before Yokohama

802
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,520
does that seem reasonable

803
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,980
okay I've got nods of heads in the room

804
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,680
and I hear no objections from the people

805
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,020
participating remotely let me just check

806
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,500
the chat to make sure that I'm not okay

807
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,880
all right

808
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,060
thank you Carson I appreciate it

809
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,260

[Music]

811
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,820
we're done here

812
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,380
all right let me uh let me check with

813
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,820
the remote participants and the people

814
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,859
in the room is there any other business

815
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,800
