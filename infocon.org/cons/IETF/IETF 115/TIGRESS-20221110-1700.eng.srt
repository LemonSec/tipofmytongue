21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,940
slide sharing

22
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,660
thing

23
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,459
yeah I see a screenshot I know it's just

24
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,700
there there is there's supposed to be a

25
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,900
oh

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,900
um I see the problem the the chair the

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,860
slides are

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,580
um

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,840
they're not um

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,640
um yeah they're

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,220
um hang on

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,239
I think there is a

33
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,440
I don't know the final name isn't

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,420
doesn't end with that dot PDF and I

35
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,940
think the meat Deco doesn't recognized

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,459
oh the the slides I didn't

37
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,959
know that that was a thing

38
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,260
let's see if I can just sort of share my

39
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,239
my uh

40
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,379
that slide window and I can just do that

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,900
all right

42
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,659
think at least then we can start doing

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,860
this

44
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,720

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,060
all right this is I in lieu of a proper

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,840
slide sharing

47
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,420
all right I'm gonna do this while and

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,580

questions

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,900

next slide

79
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,380
so the agenda for today is pretty brief

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,600
until I know uh we're gonna hand it over

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,979
to the authors we're going to walk

82
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,560
through all the draft updates they have

83
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,840
made they have taken all the feedback

84
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,699
they received from 114 and over the

85
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,620
mailing list and we'll just go over

86
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,780
through uh some of the updates they have

87
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,039
made and then uh we can move on to the

88
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,740
questions please a couple things which I

89
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,539

I I switched slides over to the the

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,620
uh let's see if I can just do that and

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,080

definitely appreciate your participation

117
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,680
so this is the the working group meeting

118
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,380
for Tigress which stands for transfer of

119
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,080
digital credentials securely next slide

120
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
please

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,280
there is a lag unfortunately

122
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,460
okay

123
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,919
um I have three presenters my name is

124
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
Casey asses and I'll be presenting with

125
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,060
Brandon Leventhal and Dimitri Vena karov

126
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,520
but we also have some additional authors

127
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,740
and a lot of them should be on the call

128
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,199
as well but that's the full list we'll

129
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,240
we'll be representing Apple alphabet as

130
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,759
well as Mercedes-Benz

131
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,220
next slide

132
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,160
okay so today's agenda we're gonna do a

133
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,440
quick overview of the problem statement

134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,240
we went over this a little bit more in

135
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,280
depth in itf114 but for those that

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,500
didn't join we just wanted to go over

137
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,460
that

138
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,139
um for the majority of the time we want

139
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,120
to talk through our requirements so this

140
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,460
is additional documentation that we've

141
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,520
done in the last three months and then

142
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,259
overall talk about what the next steps

143
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,000
for the working group are

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,979
so with that we have the problem

145
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,620
statement so in today's world there are

146
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,360
lots of different ways to add digital

147
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,460
credentials to your device and walk

148
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,940
around especially with access to hotels

149
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,060
cars home Etc and while there has been

150
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,340
some solutions for sharing within a

151
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,680
single year platform or maybe within a

152
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,080
certain type of credential right now

153
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,539
there is no widely accepted way of

154
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,880
transferring a digital credential

155
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,560
securely between digital wallets of

156
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,000
different software and Hardware

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,520
manufacturers so our main goal is to

158
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,099
find a solution that works for all types

159
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,900
of these digital credentials as well as

160
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,940
you know all platforms

161
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,139
so

162
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,479
there are three main entities as part of

163
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,399
the sharing process that are depicted

164
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,099
above we first have the sender device

165
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,020
this is the person that's originating

166
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,059
the share and they already have some

167
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,500
sort of digital credential on their

168
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,420
device and then we have the receiver

169
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,940
device this is the person or device that

170
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,800
we're trying to share too to give that

171
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
additional access

172
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,339
the sender device at the beginning

173
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,380
already has some connection with the

174
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,180
credential Authority or provisioning

175
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,600
partner this is the entity that is in

176
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,899
charge of maintaining the list of who

177
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,820
has access to what actually minting

178
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,000
those credentials for each user and just

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,660
doing full life cycle of that pass so

180
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,940
the job of the provisioning partner in

181
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,279
this situation is to give a provisioning

182
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,500
information down to the sender and the

183
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,000
sender needs to send that to their

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,959
receiver

185
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,580
so the provisioning information you

186
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,500
could just think of it as a token that

187
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,480
the credential Authority sees and knows

188
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,279
that it's okay to provision this on that

189
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,720
device

190
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
so it's very high level and we'll move

191
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,360
on to the next slide

192
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,300
all right and let's slower yeah no

193
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,839
worries so diving deep a little bit into

194
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,300
the problem statement so the digital

195
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,339
credentials on your device and the

196
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,080
hardware are that you're actually

197
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,120
interacting with in real life are owned

198
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,120
by that provisioning partner so in some

199
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,519
situations you can think of this as a

200
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,500
hotel and the hotel owning the actual

201
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,600
locks on the doors or you can think of

202
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,760
this as you being the one that owns the

203
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,920
locks on your home for example you are

204
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,360
your own provisioning partner in that

205
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,680
situation

206
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,500
so these provisioning Partners need to

207
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,360
keep track of these share networks that

208
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,100
you might create as well as the

209
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,100
provisions associated with each user so

210
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,560
that could mean that you have shared to

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,420
three or four different people and each

212
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,800
of the people might have different

213
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,320
access rights or different entitlements

214
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,180
Associated and that provisioning partner

215
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,680
is meant to keep track of that so you

216
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,899
can manage them at any moment

217
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,420
so these provisioning Partners want to

218
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,160
enable sharing provisioning information

219
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,740
between Ascend and receiver independent

220
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,880
of the software and Hardware

221
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,980
manufacturer so they also don't want to

222
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,019
be keeping track of who has implemented

223
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,700
what or making different unique

224
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,019
Solutions per

225
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,180
manufacturer

226
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,739
so next slide

227
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,880
so just to go a little bit into a use

228
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,279
case let's talk about a hotel use case

229
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,040
so say I'm staying in a hotel

230
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
when you actually when I'm staying at

231
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,940
this hotel the hotel operator owns this

232
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,740
property as well as the physical locks

233
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,060
like I was just saying

234
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,459
so during my visit I'm actually only

235
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,440
renting a room I'm not the one that owns

236
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,779
that and so therefore that's why the

237
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,640
credentials went by the hotel

238
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,160
so say that I've paid for two people to

239
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,779
be able to access my room and therefore

240
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,360
I can add up to two keys for my room

241
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,540
once I I reserve the hotel room under my

242
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,459
name and therefore I can download or

243
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,399
create provision a digital hotel Key on

244
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,680
my device however I want to be able to

245
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,600
share that with my partner or my spouse

246
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,820
that's going to be joining me

247
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,980
so therefore the hotel or the

248
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,899
provisioning partner will provide me

249
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:43,920
with the provisioning information

250
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,980
required to give to my spouse so that

251
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,420
they can then provision their own hotel

252
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,660
Key so the nice part about this is a lot

253
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,100
of com a lot of hotels these days

254
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,560
require you to make accounts with them

255
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,839
like a high account for example in order

256
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,480
to provision or have access to their app

257
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,360
and so when you share to your receiver

258
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,980
they shouldn't have to have access to

259
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,959
the app or create another account Etc

260
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,279
they should just have that provisioning

261
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,300
information and that should be

262
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,279
sufficient to redeem and get that hotel

263
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,600
Key

264
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,579
lastly at the end of your stay the

265
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,500
producing partner will manage the key

266
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,720
delete it off your devices and you're

267
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,240
good to go no stopping at the lobby

268
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,180
so now I'll be handing off to Dimitri to

269
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,800
go through our requirements and start

270
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,339
the discussion

271
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,000
thank you Casey

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,339
um thank you for showing interest to our

273
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,980
working group

274
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,540
can we please yes

275
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,060
um so in the previous conversation uh

276
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,260
IDF conference represented the solution

277
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,959
and the work questions and the feedback

278
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,959
that we received was we were trying to

279
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,260
propose something without defining uh

280
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,899
formal requirements we decided to step

281
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:01,920
back

282
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
uh write a draft containing formal

283
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,019
requirements to the solution and another

284
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,500
draft with sample implementation threat

285
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,839
modeling and present it to the community

286
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,480
uh during this conference

287
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,100
and right now we're going to go over

288
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,220
several slides which show assumptions

289
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,380
that we made

290
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,500
um and then a requirements grew into

291
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,639
certain groups like slide on the slides

292
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
um next slide please

293
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,600
so the assumptions to the solution

294
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,680
um

295
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,959
we have some knowledge about the

296
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,380
credential digital credentials and based

297
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,579
on that knowledge

298
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,519
we come here to ask for advice from

299
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,760
Community whether these assumptions and

300
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,959
requirements

301
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,980
uh look valid we come here

302
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,720
to um

303
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,820
for help basically

304
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,279
the first assumption is

305
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,399
revision partner may not allow for two

306
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,339
users to use the same credential or

307
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,040
cryptographic material

308
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,079
um this assumption is based on the fact

309
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,200
many of the digital

310
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,300
credential providers they own the

311
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,820
infrastructure as Casey mentioned on her

312
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,839
slides

313
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,240
they own it and they want to distinguish

314
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,540
between two credentials

315
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,060
with different indictments access rights

316
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,240
and even the time the credential can be

317
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,600
used to access property

318
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,139
um

319
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,199
second assumption user may not have the

320
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,779
ability to revoke a credential that a

321
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,139
provision partner has issued again this

322
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,240
assumption is based on the fact that the

323
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,639
property is owned by

324
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,240
um

325
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,260
Hotel chain or a private owner

326
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,100
and people who have access in the

327
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,100
digital wallet to the property

328
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,160
they're just given a right to access

329
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,100
temporarily or maybe for a longer time

330
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,760
um

331
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,300
third is user may have not ability to

332
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,519
create new digital Keys Without

333
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,459
provisioning Partners interaction so

334
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,579
again in order to receive an access to a

335
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,300
hotel room I first need to request a

336
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,599
property owner to issue a new credential

337
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,220
security communication between sender

338
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,380
and receiver and provisioning partner

339
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,560
should be trusted so obviously when the

340
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,079
new credential is issued

341
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,459
um the channel

342
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,779
needs to be trusted

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
um the next is the choice of

344
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,839
integumentary shall be defined by

345
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,000
application initiating the credential

346
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,300
transfer so our solution proposed an

347
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,880
integumentary server we understand it's

348
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,160
just one of the way to approach this

349
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,240
problem and we specifically propose that

350
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,639
intermediate survey in our solution

351
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,680
in order to

352
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,819
achieve some goals

353
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,720
if I have a key in my wallet and I want

354
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,360
to initiate a sharing process with my

355
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,320
friend

356
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,100
uh I want to offload that

357
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,260
revisioning information in encrypted

358
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,899
format and store it temporarily for the

359
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,940
time of the transfer

360
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,579
and that's what our integumentary server

361
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,139
is intended for

362
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,600
and there should be certain level of

363
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,180
trust between me as initiating under

364
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,060
transfer and the intermediary server who

365
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,279
temporarily stores the content

366
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,779
um the next one is sander and receiver

367
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,720
shall both be able to manage the search

368
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,480
credential at any point by communicating

369
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,459
with the packaging partner

370
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,099
credential life cycle management is out

371
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,140
of scope for this proposal

372
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,199
which means the credential which I have

373
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,619
in my wallet in order to be managed

374
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,740
it needs to be managed by the revision

375
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,799
partner so let's say Hotel chain that

376
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,359
owns the

377
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,939
um rooms in the hotels and all the logs

378
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,459
and the hotels and I can only issue

379
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,340
requests for them to change

380
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,220
the access rights or maybe life cycle of

381
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,679
the credential

382
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,900
um and the final assumption is any

383
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,559
device OEM with a digital credential

384
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,600
implementation adherent to Tigris

385
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,299
so be able to receive shared

386
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,299
provisioning information whether or not

387
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,880
they can't originate provisioning

388
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,299
information themselves or host their own

389
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,919
intermediary

390
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,179
uh

391
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,400
we want to separate the credential

392
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,460
initiation and the credential

393
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,860
provisioning so if I receive a link from

394
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,440
my friend invite from my friend in form

395
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,980
of URL to my Digi to my device

396
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,100
I shall be able to provision that accept

397
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,240
the link

398
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,120
and provision a pass to my wallet

399
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,220
and uh

400
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,440
basically that's it separation between

401
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,100
initiation by sender and um

402
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,620
provisioning by the recipient

403
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,120
oh next slide please

404
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,740
and now we go to the requirements

405
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,820
so

406
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,280
um there was a lengthy process uh

407
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
discussing this in both

408
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,640
um

409
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,539
private GitHub repository and on a maven

410
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,380
group

411
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,440
with both co-authors and all people

412
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,380
interested in this in this work group

413
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,360
and as a result of that we tried to

414
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,580
formalize requirements to the solution

415
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,960
that we propose

416
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,539
so I will read the groups of the

417
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,580
requirements and then uh if there are

418
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,400
questions we can discuss it either at

419
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
and or at the end of this slide

420
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,620
so first requirement says requirement

421
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,179
connectivity

422
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,840
uh sender and receiver devices shall be

423
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,580
allowed to be online at different times

424
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,679
both devices shall never need to be

425
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,960
online at the same time

426
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,320
so simple example I want to share a key

427
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,280
to um to my home or to my car with my

428
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,059
friend

429
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,480
so I initiated sure I send them a URL

430
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,840
which points to that temporary storage

431
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,880
provisioning information

432
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,760
and my connectivity shall be limited

433
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,500
just for that time

434
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,200
my friend may be offline at the time but

435
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,640
when they receive an SMS or email or

436
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,539
encrypted message

437
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,900
with that link with that URL they shall

438
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,120
be able to provision

439
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,100
um that credential to their wallet

440
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,860
haven't connected to internet

441
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,740
at that time the initiator the sender

442
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,240
don't need to be online

443
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,480
um

444
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,240
the second requirement is solution

445
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,780
should allow sander to send her

446
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,720
invitation to receiver over any

447
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,260
messaging Channel with Vegas degrees of

448
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,460
security

449
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,460
so again going back to our proposing a

450
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,240
proposed solution

451
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,500
temporarily store the provisioning

452
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,799
information uh the voucher which allows

453
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,080
our friend to provision that information

454
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,020
to the wallet restore that temporarily

455
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,120
on integumentary server

456
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,900
and we can share the link pointing to

457
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,580
that provisioning information with our

458
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,820
friend over multiple channels over a

459
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,059
simple SMS which has a limit of 140

460
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,799
characters

461
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,960
over email WhatsApp iMessage or any

462
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,340
other maybe signal protocol

463
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,580
the next requirement is P2P so go with

464
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,059
that too soon

465
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,260
so P2P means means that we are trying to

466
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,000
focus presenting this particular

467
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,740
Solution on person to person

468
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,140
um share a process of credentials so I

469
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,000
want to share my credential with a

470
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,380
single person

471
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,220
and the goal sharing which means if I

472
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,720
wanted to share it with multiple people

473
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,340
at the same time

474
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,799
is not in focus for given particular

475
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,640
solution even though we do not preclude

476
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
that goal in the future

477
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,080
um

478
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,840
if there is any questions to this

479
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,299
particular group of our requirements

480
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,760
please help them

481
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,280
uh otherwise we can move on to the next

482
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,418
group of requirements

483
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,340
if do you have a clarifying question

484
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,120
otherwise okay I think it's easier if we

485
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,500
kind of because we have a lot of flies

486
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,179
if we can just run through them and then

487
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,159
we can do interrupt for clarifying

488
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,780
questions and then

489
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,000
we do kind of discussion at the end I

490
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,220
appreciate it um

491
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,720
all right

492
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,799
um

493
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,720
transfer data

494
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,860
so

495
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,380
first requirement is arbitrary format

496
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,480
since there is multitude of different

497
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,480
credential types let's say some of them

498
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,240
are digital car key so it's a credential

499
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,220
which allows you to operate your car

500
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,240
open it start the engine drive it Etc

501
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,539
other types of credential can cover

502
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,580
digital keys to your hotel room

503
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,220
other types of credential can allow you

504
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,539
to open

505
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,260
um

506
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,140
an apartment door in a multi-family home

507
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,200
or maybe a private

508
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,820
a door in a private home

509
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,299
so all these may be um

510
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,400
regulated by different specifications

511
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,620
some of them can be published as carcon

512
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,799
Integrity Consortium some of them or are

513
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,100
proprietary to certain hotel chains so

514
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,360
we want our solution uh to try to

515
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,940
approach and handle all these type of

516
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,940
credentials to try to allow users to

517
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,580
share them to transfer these credentials

518
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,840
from one person to another

519
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,820
um the next requirement

520
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,559
um is round trips

521
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,000
again

522
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,440
um some of the credential types require

523
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,179
multiple Communications between two

524
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,600
devices using intermediary server for

525
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,780
instance in a car key world when I want

526
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,020
to share a cover a key to my car with my

527
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,460
friend

528
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,179
um

529
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,059
I'm getting deeper into details now

530
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,120
um but when I want to do that the actual

531
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,760
keys are generated on my friend's device

532
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,440
and then the friend will send back to me

533
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,740
uh key import request in order to be

534
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,400
signed by me as a car owner and then I

535
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,799
need to sign that um

536
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,080
key import request and send it back to

537
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,320
my friend and only then friend can uh

538
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,840
provision the new credential which was

539
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,700
generated on their device

540
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,179
that's why for some protocols we need

541
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,900
multiple round trips between two

542
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,460
and the third requirement is preview

543
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,159
this is mostly for user experience the

544
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,620
better user experience so as a friend

545
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,559
when I receive a URL the short

546
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,600
credential I want to be able to

547
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
understand what I'm trying to provision

548
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,100
to my wallet

549
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,679
um basically that's it

550
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,240
um I guess we can move on

551
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,659
security and privacy security

552
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,059
a solution should provide security of

553
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,539
the provisioning data transferred

554
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,039
confidentiality integrity and

555
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,539
availability

556
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,720
uh simply said depression in data that

557
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,360
we temporarily store on integumentary

558
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,500
server

559
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,600
needs to be secured

560
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,740
and

561
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,559
I'm here making a reference to the

562
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,080
security triangle

563
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,320
um second requirement is revocation

564
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,539
Solutions shall maintain Access Control

565
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,020
allowing sender to revoke before the

566
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,720
share has been accepted and for receiver

567
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,179
to and transfer at any time

568
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,940
since sometimes transfer can include

569
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,940
multiple steps bow sender and receiver

570
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,020
shall be able to control

571
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,059
entrybook like cancel shocking process

572
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,760
at any step

573
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,779
um

574
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,299
we can move on please

575
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,400
um actually we have somebody in the

576
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,900
queue and yeah

577
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,320
maybe Michael I don't know

578
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,779
hi um just the one that's on the slide

579
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,039
there requirement security so

580
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,539
confidential integrity and availability

581
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,279
do you mean Authentication

582
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,200
seems that's bundled up with security

583
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,320
um I'll get to there uh not purely

584
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,659
authentication uh in the Forum we

585
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,419
normally um okay understand that it's

586
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,200
not strong authentication by any

587
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,960
uh like like digital certificates um

588
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,299
okay and is availability a security

589
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,559
property would it not be better to have

590
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,720
it as a separate requirement

591
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,640
ah

592
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,220
right so availability normally it's a

593
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,620
recommendation to implement her to

594
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,860
um to provide to implement some measures

595
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,320
to guarantee availability of that

596
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,080
intermediary server yeah like did those

597
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,159
attacks

598
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,520
measures against that okay

599
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,559
um yeah I I would say have it as a

600
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,559
separate requirement but uh okay of

601
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,740
course

602
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,880
um now I'm moving to the requirements

603
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,340
by referring to our integumentary server

604
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,360
so again

605
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,000
our solution proposes a temporary

606
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,580
storage in the form of integrated server

607
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,100
so we can see that we often refer to

608
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,500
that as a mailbox storage so we create

609
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,419
some tamper your place

610
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,620
a store that provision information uh in

611
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,760
encrypted form in that temporary place

612
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,220
and both devices can use it to exchange

613
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,900
that

614
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,919
so first requirements is privacy

615
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:53,940
um

616
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,520
an integumentary server shall not be

617
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,640
able to correlate users between

618
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,299
exchanges or create social graph

619
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,500
it shall never be an Arbiter of identity

620
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,539
so it's a very strong requirement

621
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:13,020
because we don't want our solution to

622
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,620
collect information about user identity

623
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,840
store that sell it use it in any form

624
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,740
and due to that

625
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,500
our requirement to Authentication

626
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,480
cannot use strong authentication

627
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,020
um we cannot send user identity to that

628
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,000
integumentary server because it can be

629
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,480
collected

630
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,320
second is requirement notified so again

631
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,500
it's mostly for the ease of user

632
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,980
experience so in that in the

633
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,340
use case when there is a multiple

634
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,500
exchange like round trips between sender

635
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,480
and the receiver devices and whenever

636
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,000
each device updates the content stored

637
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,080
on intermediary server we want

638
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,400
push notification some automatic

639
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,820
notification to be sent to a appropriate

640
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,640
party in order to notify them to come

641
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,460
and fetch an update

642
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,960
and uh the next requirement is opaque so

643
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,240
the message content I'm referring to

644
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,980
that provisioning information that we

645
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,440
store temporarily on our integumentary

646
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,000
server

647
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,299
um so not I shall be opaque to that

648
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,760
server so which means

649
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,820
if I Implement that integumentary server

650
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,000
I shall not be able to look into what's

651
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,600
stored there or use it

652
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,419
um let's say by provisioning a pass to

653
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,360
someone else's digital wallet

654
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,720
Dimitri we have a question from yaron

655
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,380
of course

656
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,840
your answer for

657
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
um

658
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,140
so first of all uh privacy is mentioned

659
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,200
in the draft but very sparsely there's

660
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,820
only one requirement and

661
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,580
I would like to contrast two use cases

662
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,640
that to me demonstrate that we need to

663
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,179
think at least one level down deeper

664
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:31,559
into privacy so in the case of

665
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,940
of car credentials

666
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,820
if I lend you lend you my car for two

667
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,840
hours

668
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,880
I don't want anybody to know about it

669
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,820
it's just just between you and me

670
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,559
however if

671
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,080
in the case of a hotel room it makes

672
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,020
sense and in fact Casey mentioned that

673
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,480
the hotel needs to know about it and

674
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,940
needs to have the identity of the second

675
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,140
person

676
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,779
so those are two different very

677
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,419
different use cases

678
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:06,960
um

679
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,640
and I don't see how they can coexist but

680
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,940
appreciate that clarification

681
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,340
um thank you for a question it's a

682
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,399
really good one and we actually uh

683
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,679
received that question in some forms

684
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,240
previously

685
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,919
so uh the state is that currently

686
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,020
um access

687
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,880
uh to a car using digital credential is

688
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,000
it has only one published standard which

689
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,159
comes from CC

690
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,539
body

691
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,460
and it defines how a digital credential

692
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,700
can be used in order to provide access

693
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,539
to the car if there were other standards

694
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,760
let's say Open Standards which would

695
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,919
regulate those we would be gladly and

696
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,720
using them unfortunately there is only

697
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,880
one standard and it requires

698
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,100
communication to so-called vehicle om

699
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,080
server so simply put I can I can do that

700
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,840
exchange between two devices generate a

701
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,059
new credential and

702
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,100
add it to the wallet on the receiving

703
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,179
device

704
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,539
but there is always that last step so in

705
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,520
order for that credential to work

706
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,279
the CCC

707
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,200
requires a request to be sent to the

708
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,740
vehicle or M server in order to register

709
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,320
that newly minted credential so that the

710
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,299
car recognizes it we try to argue in one

711
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,240
of the CCC meetings and the answer was

712
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,260
since modern cards especially those who

713
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,200
Implement that standard they are very

714
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,500
expensive assets and car manufacturers

715
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,580
they don't want to carry responsibility

716
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,860
for illegal access to the Curve so if

717
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,140
you want your Anonymous car by an old

718
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,299
mechanical Ford

719
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,039
I guess that's the answer should we yeah

720
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,120
but somebody was on the Queue here uh I

721
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,559
I'm I'm seeing Alex

722
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,899
in that case if that's a requirement if

723
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,380
you if you need to follow the CCC stamp

724
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,620
to be compliant with the CCC standard

725
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,440
and it to some degree contradicts at

726
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,500
least the the

727
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,080
intention of other requirements this

728
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,360
needs to be pointed out as a requirement

729
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
yes

730
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,299
um

731
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,059
I think that's a very good command um

732
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,960
the only thing uh I want to mention is

733
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,240
that this is a requirement for for our

734
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,700
particular solution and our particular

735
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,620
solution basically covers just the

736
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,860
transfer part and CCC uh

737
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,779
defines the provisioning part so once

738
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,279
the credential is provisioned to the

739
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,559
wallet what are the next steps to start

740
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,960
using that credential right so we have a

741
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,839
key to the wallet in the wallet so how

742
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,260
do I open the car with that new key

743
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,760
there should be some exchange between

744
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,060
the device and the car in order to let

745
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,940
the device starting to control the car

746
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
um

747
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,119
but it's it's a great question and we

748
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,619
realize

749
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:35,399
um

750
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,219
the sensitivity of that matter we do

751
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,760
realize uh again if there is a standard

752
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,099
and if anyone is willing to start

753
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,460
working on the standard which would be

754
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,739
um

755
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,119
which would control the access to the

756
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,679
car

757
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,580
um we would be willing and glad to adopt

758
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,700
that

759
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,580
um I think Dimitri as you mentioned this

760
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,020
is Alex speaking

761
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,359
um Alex Peltier the distinction here is

762
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,720
that this privacy requirement is for the

763
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,220
intermediary if there is one and that it

764
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,079
doesn't track it but the provisioning

765
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,420
partner credential Authority always

766
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,520
needs to know who is in control of the

767
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,040
keys so whether that is a non-device

768
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,920
credential Authority or a hotel they

769
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,420
they need to know who is shared to who

770
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,060
and so there's not privacy in that sense

771
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,640
this is privacy for the transfer

772
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,940
protocol

773
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,799
thank you Alex

774
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,618
go to the microphone

775
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,240
this needs to be clarified so that

776
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,060
people who read the the protocol or the

777
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,520
requirements understand their privacy

778
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,839
implications and either way I I strongly

779
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:59,599
disagree with Alex's latest statement

780
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,359
whether the the credential issue needs

781
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,599
to know of a certain delegation is per

782
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,800
use case

783
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,700
and not necessarily always

784
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,660
thank you very much

785
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,700
um if you have time we have that

786
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,119
document published in at GitHub and at

787
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,560
the end of the presentation there is a

788
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,700
link

789
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,400
um all the URLs to the documents if you

790
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,820
could come and leave your feedback uh

791
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,099
it's or maybe in the mailing Group which

792
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,320
is better probably

793
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,839
um we would very much appreciate it I

794
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,480
would suggest that you open an issue on

795
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,420
on this particular topic

796
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,900
um so we don't forget to can I clear it

797
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,640
and then we can address that later

798
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,960
all right

799
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,339
um continuation

800
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,200
um of our requirements

801
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,339
so

802
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,079
again this is

803
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,280
um about our integrity server and

804
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,720
we want

805
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,240
these in technology server to implement

806
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,660
some mechanisms to prevent abuse by

807
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,700
sharing shaking device

808
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,220
we find that the device is in good

809
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,040
standing and the content generated by

810
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,380
the sender device can be trusted by

811
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,060
integumentary

812
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,300
the trust mechanism could be proprietary

813
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,720
or publicly verifiable for example in

814
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,540
form of web Authentication

815
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,020
um simply put we want to establish since

816
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,900
share initiation is the crucial part of

817
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,119
the transfer process we want to

818
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,280
establish special trust mechanisms

819
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,339
between sender device and integumentary

820
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:48,599
server both of these need to start to

821
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,040
trust each other

822
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,720
and the way we propose is by using

823
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,280
attestation

824
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,300
not linked to the user identity

825
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,900
um

826
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,400
so whenever

827
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,040
sending device creates a mailbox the

828
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,960
content can be covered by the

829
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,420
attestation blob which incognitively

830
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,720
server can verify following defined

831
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,800
rules

832
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,859
and make a decision whether to trust the

833
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,020
content or not

834
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,200
and the next requirement covers the

835
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,079
receiving device so for the case of

836
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,660
receiving the device

837
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,140
the level of trust the level

838
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,680
of requirement is lower so we don't want

839
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,300
the receiver device to provide

840
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,060
attestation or any strong authentication

841
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,780
we just wanted to trust a list of

842
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,820
um integumentary servers

843
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,300
it can work with so whenever I receive

844
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,180
that URL to that temporary storage

845
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,119
on the integumentary server we only want

846
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,940
we only propose so the receiving device

847
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,300
has a low list of intermediary servers

848
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,020
so uh recognized

849
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,140
by device manufacturers and if

850
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,040
that integumentary server in the list we

851
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,780
make an assumption it can be trusted

852
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,420
again we are not enforcing strong

853
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,160
authentication

854
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,119
um

855
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,640
here because of the Privacy requirement

856
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,779
which we covered before

857
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,660
and these

858
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,359
concludes all the requirements

859
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,640
we have only in q

860
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,900
yeah

861
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,359
I was wondering about that list you said

862
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:37,920
that the device manufacturer

863
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,720
manufactured the list in my device can I

864
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,180
manage that list to make sure I control

865
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,160
who I'm trust

866
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,000
um

867
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
should I always only trust the

868
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,780
manufacturer

869
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,820
um good question so um

870
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,619
when I say device what I actually mean

871
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,140
is a digital wallet the application that

872
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,599
manages credentials on your mobile

873
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,400
device right and if someone

874
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,200
implements the digital wallet they have

875
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,160
a control over what

876
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,140
integumentary servers they can interact

877
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,960
with and who can be included in that

878
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,280
trusted list

879
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,960
and I believe

880
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,920
it's the details of implementation so it

881
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,839
can be a done

882
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,480
by allowing users add

883
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,359
new intermediary service into that list

884
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,579
or it can be hard-coded or in some form

885
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:41,400
programmed onto your application

886
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,060
so uh in the solution that we propose we

887
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,619
have a list of

888
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,980
intermediary servers which includes

889
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,040
um one two three four five right and we

890
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,320
as Developers

891
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,260
as the owners of that digital wallet

892
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,440
application we make decision Who We

893
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,859
Trust

894
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,240
well in iitf we develop protocols that

895
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,160
can be implemented in many ways and

896
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,480
assuming that only you as a device owner

897
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,420
is in control of that list

898
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,060
and for users

899
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,060
using the protocol

900
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,180
in another situation that you think

901
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,980
shouldn't be able to manipulate and edit

902
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,280
that list or add to that list if I mean

903
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,900
if I want to add

904
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,140
an intermediary to my phone I should be

905
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,700
able to do that because that

906
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,859
intermediate handles the credentials

907
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:47,220
that I need and your list doesn't

908
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,959
so be careful here

909
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,820
um thank you that was great question

910
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,500
again

911
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,260
um it's very sensitive matter let's say

912
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,980
I want to develop my application

913
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,000
and it's my responsibility to define the

914
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,380
rules the security rules my application

915
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,660
is following when we interact with the

916
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,980
user

917
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,140
um I don't know if you agree or not with

918
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,280
that

919
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,040
so I'll I'll go on the I'll go on the

920
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,200
cube as an individual

921
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,339
um and and um say that I mean the the in

922
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,500
the EU wallet space right that the EU is

923
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,000
taking more or less the same approach as

924
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,800
Apple does here right so you're it's

925
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,780
kind of up to the wallet application to

926
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,700
Define

927
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,280
what its trust list is

928
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,200
um and so you I think the deployment

929
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,540
model you're going to see is

930
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,780
possibly multiple wallet applications

931
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,220
you know and and that they will kind of

932
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,800
vary with ecosystems so I don't think

933
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,359
there is any

934
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,119
there's not any necessarily any like

935
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:56,220
huge impact here right for user control

936
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,599
because there will be multiple

937
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,400
ecosystems or multiple Wallet app and

938
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,839
they will be used for different things

939
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,020
thank you we've also talked about this

940
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,180
kind of issue I think in 114 we've

941
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,160
talked about potentially having a list

942
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,380
of these existing intermediary servers

943
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,680
maybe not in the actual Solutions spec

944
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,260
but maybe in an implementation guide so

945
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,760
for whatever ones that are considered

946
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,800
accepted you know or the working group

947
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,359
would get to accept them and add it to

948
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,619
the spec

949
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,540
um but we can definitely talk about that

950
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,400
more as we have more intermediary

951
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,980
servers I'm just going to make an

952
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,839
administrative decision to stop sharing

953
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,540
because people can easier to can find

954
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,599
the um QR code and and get on the

955
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,079
speaker list

956
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,560
the other point made about um

957
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
uh users being able to add

958
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,460
intermediaries if they want that it

959
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,020
shouldn't be something that apps

960
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,720
unilaterally decide for their users

961
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,700
um the other thing I wanted to raise was

962
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,500
um throughout the requirements uh you

963
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,599
stated if an intermediary is required

964
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,339
for the solution and I think you've

965
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,480
demonstrated some cases where actually

966
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,920
genuine is required and Cloud

967
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,599
manufacturers don't seem to want to

968
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,220
delegate

969
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,780
um permissions to people who own things

970
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,800
and

971
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,180
yeah I think that says something about

972
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,619
the way but

973
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,599
um ownership Works nowadays

974
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,599
um if the

975
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:20,280
um intermediary is required in some

976
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,619
solutions will it be possible to use

977
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,440
this protocol without an intermediary

978
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,480
does that make sense I I realize that

979
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,400
intermediate is sometimes required but

980
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,960
if that means those protocol always

981
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,000
means they need to be intermediably

982
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,560
required I think that's a step backwards

983
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:39,839
not like not necessarily required for

984
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,460
even for the car key stuff that's more

985
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,859
of like communication with the car OEM

986
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,540
is required

987
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,000
um in theory like you could implement

988
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,520
the intermediary on a device itself

989
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,500
um so you know there could be this could

990
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,240
be extended to a place where it's just a

991
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,540
device to device communication um and if

992
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,819
you go to OEM that even supported you

993
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:01,200
know provisioning that they're creating

994
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,240
that key from the sending device like in

995
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,859
theory you could do all this offline

996
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:08,280
without you know having uh anyone or

997
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,800
like any third party interact with you

998
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,300
um I imagine that if you even took a

999
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,800
step further and you know you did it

1000
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,180
over like a protocol like Bluetooth or

1001
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,980
something um then you could do it you

1002
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,180
know completely

1003
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,760
like just device to device in proximity

1004
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,680
okay thank you I just want to check that

1005
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,760
wasn't being written out to the protocol

1006
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,300
thank you

1007
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,400
all right are there any other questions

1008
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,079
in the room

1009
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,740
remote

1010
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,879
okay so we're running for the like

1011
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,079
so uh I'll just ask the authors to kind

1012
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,240
of summarize the status of all the

1013
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,400
drafts you have currently

1014
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,380
so that everybody understands Where We

1015
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,339
Are

1016
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:59,760
so Dimitri Casey anyone can

1017
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,140
sure no problem

1018
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,700
so since 114 at 114 we had a proposed

1019
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,579
solution draft that uh we voted on and

1020
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:09,980
then have worked on a little bit since

1021
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,859
so now we have a requirements draft and

1022
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:16,079
a sample implementation and threat model

1023
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,300
draft that are all published a data

1024
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,720
tracker so we've I'm really excited

1025
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,280
we've gotten a lot of feedback on the

1026
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,780
requirements draft in the last couple of

1027
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,420
weeks from different members I think a

1028
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,740
lot of them are probably in the security

1029
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,480
dispatch meeting

1030
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,819
um but that's in a much better spot than

1031
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,800
it was even a couple months ago

1032
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,599
and a sample implementation is probably

1033
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,400
the newest so definitely take a look at

1034
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,900
it if you have a moment

1035
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,540
um so yeah that's the status then

1036
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,339
they're all obviously on GitHub and the

1037
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,339
links are on our slide deck

1038
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:48,900
all right

1039
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,960
um

1040
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,880
so I think for the authors we still have

1041
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,079
some feedback that we need to

1042
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,819
incorporate in the requirements draft I

1043
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,260
think right before this email we got

1044
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,680
some comment from Ecker as well uh so

1045
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,859
the next steps would be for you all to

1046
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:06,900
go back and incorporate those feedbacks

1047
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,660
and uh publish a new version of the

1048
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,180
draft requirements draft and then we can

1049
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,480
probably do an adoption call

1050
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,859
does that sounds like uh at forward yeah

1051
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:21,359
leave do you have anything to add to

1052
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,200
that

1053
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,319
I think that's a I mean it kind of

1054
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,480
allows you to iterate

1055
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,339
um a little bit quicker right we're

1056
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:32,760
we're getting a lot of feedback and as

1057
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,160
while the draft is kind of under your

1058
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,280
editorial control you you it's kind of

1059
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,740
up to you how you process all of the the

1060
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,099
your your your your own change requests

1061
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,900
basically on the document

1062
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,240
um but you know we're I think we're also

1063
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,339
getting to the point where it's it makes

1064
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:51,660
sense to kind of move it into the

1065
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,980
working group because that's kind of

1066
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,780
where we want them to be but once we get

1067
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,460
to that point we have to start getting

1068
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,160
consensus sort of in a different way and

1069
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,079
the the documents were willed by their

1070
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,839
by that nature move a little bit slower

1071
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,780
um so I think we in in for practical

1072
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,940
reasons it actually helps if we can if

1073
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,099
we see that there isn't a lot of

1074
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,319
contention on the list around the

1075
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,599
comments that is coming in I I don't

1076
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,280
think we're seeing that I just think

1077
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,260
we're seeing like good content and good

1078
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,599
suggestions is sort of incorporate those

1079
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,640
and then we're at the point where all

1080
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,619
right let's fine-tune the resulting

1081
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,839
document in our in as a working group

1082
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,420
document yeah and one last piece I

1083
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,859
wanted to note that I don't think we

1084
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,720
mentioned this at 114 but we do have two

1085
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,280
parties that have implemented our

1086
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,740
solution and We Know It Works which is a

1087
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,760
good thing

1088
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,260
um and of course we'd love to keep

1089
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,760
incorporating comments and tweaking it

1090
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,680
but I think at least we have good proof

1091
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,359
of Concepts um

1092
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,520
which is exciting and I think that we've

1093
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,079
also had just some discussion in the

1094
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,180
working in the working group email list

1095
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,400
and I get about different solutions and

1096
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,640
I think we were a little bit too fast to

1097
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,200
say that other Solutions wouldn't work I

1098
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,640
think it's true other Solutions might

1099
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,960
have worked for this

1100
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,819
um I think we were just looking for a

1101
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,020
nice straightforward way that it would

1102
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,700
work and that anyone would be able to

1103
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,220
implement so I just wanted to add that

1104
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,780
and definitely acknowledge that because

1105
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,740
I feel like we weren't acknowledging

1106
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,420
that very well in our last meeting

1107
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,000
we should definitely think about running

1108
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,819
a hackathon

1109
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:20,160
session I don't know whether Yokohama is

1110
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,960
too soon or I don't know what you think

1111
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,140
prachi but uh yeah no hackathon would be

1112
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,000
a great idea I think and we can propose

1113
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,339
the idea I mean I'm sure we'll get good

1114
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:30,839
participation

1115
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:33,599
I mean if we if we if we can pull off a

1116
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,720
successful hackathon session at an iitf

1117
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,520
with like where we know that the

1118
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,740
industry relevant Industries are present

1119
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,720
that that actually helps kind of move

1120
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,578
things along quite a lot

1121
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,780
I see Tommy in the queue

1122
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:57,720
hello

1123
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,579
yes yeah I was just having to wait for

1124
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,440
audio to kick in

1125
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,940
um

1126
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,680
so

1127
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,119
uh

1128
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:08,520
you know I I've been following this work

1129
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,660
um

1130
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,260
both from IAB standpoint as well as a

1131
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,260
person at apple and a while ago we did

1132
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,700
have a conversation with CCC about this

1133
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,099
and talking about the fact that there

1134
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,440
are these essentially early versions

1135
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,780
where we're testing interop now and may

1136
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,579
even you know we can have deployment

1137
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:31,140
that works between the different things

1138
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,500
but the protocol is expected to evolve

1139
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,359
based on

1140
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:38,640
uh the discussion in the working group

1141
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,220
and even

1142
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,839
you know if we're looking at the

1143
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,280
direction that some people are pointing

1144
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,540
to like okay maybe it's going to be a

1145
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,920
profile of web dev or you know something

1146
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,859
else it could like take a very sharp

1147
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:53,460
turn as far as the implementation and

1148
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,440
what I'm wondering when we're talking

1149
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,660
about uh hackathon or are these early

1150
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,280
implementations

1151
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,500
he's kind of like what is do we have a

1152
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,740
strategy that's formalized for how we

1153
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,859
evolve from an early implementation and

1154
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:10,020
saying like Okay the client

1155
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,940
when it knows it's trying to share a

1156
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,760
credential or receive a credential knows

1157
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,319
what version it's on like oh this is on

1158
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,359
the early proprietary version how will

1159
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:22,020
those clients migrate to what it ends up

1160
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,000
being and

1161
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,500
I think that that answer could be

1162
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,020
different depending on like is it a

1163
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,579
tweak of what you're doing today or is

1164
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:31,079
it a completely different protocol

1165
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:32,880
server you need to point to and how do

1166
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,380
you recognize that you need to do that

1167
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,359
so I just want to point out that we

1168
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,740
should consider that and I'm curious to

1169
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,598
hear if you have thoughts already

1170
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,420
so I see Brad in the cube Brad are you

1171
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,460
trying to answer the question

1172
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,839
yeah

1173
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,760
um I don't know if this is a great

1174
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,599
answer

1175
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,000
um but I think one of the uh takeaways

1176
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,280
we got from the quick experience is

1177
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,980
thinking about versioning early on in

1178
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,020
the protocol development allows you to

1179
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,540
make those like very sharp uh pivots um

1180
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,160
and maybe that's what you were trying to

1181
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,559
get at Tommy but I I do think that's an

1182
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,059
area that we need to start thinking

1183
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,319
through

1184
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,300
um as we start to move into the working

1185
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,460
group adopting these things is having a

1186
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,800
very reliable versioning system so that

1187
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,420
we can keep the design space open

1188
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,680
right and you know quick is a good

1189
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,020
example I think it started with you know

1190
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,240
there's a variant of like this is a

1191
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,520
packet over UDP and like this first

1192
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,140
little bit will tell you the version and

1193
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,760
that's the thing

1194
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,480
um

1195
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,579
what is I guess I'm asking what is it in

1196
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,300
this case is it a URL that we get and

1197
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,460
the URL that tells us

1198
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,440
where to point to as the intermediary

1199
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,480
that that is the thing that tells us the

1200
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,640
version or is it something within the

1201
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,839
TLs connection Etc

1202
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:56,339
hey Alex speaking currently the show URL

1203
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,780
that's accepted has a version in there

1204
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,760
and right now it's version one so if it

1205
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,619
was updated to be version two clients

1206
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:03,960
that supported version two could uh

1207
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,300
dramatically different things really uh

1208
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,059
perfect I'm gonna show my ignorance here

1209
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,859
but my understanding of web dev is that

1210
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:12,900
it's an extension of HTTP so I think

1211
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,000
that given the way it's set up now is

1212
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,559
like all the other potential solutions

1213
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,780
that are are being

1214
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,300
fit into the you know the proprietary

1215
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,460
solution that is working right now

1216
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,099
okay so essentially we're assuming that

1217
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,920
everything bootstraps off of a URL that

1218
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,280
begins with https colon slash slash and

1219
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,960
there's something in it that can

1220
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,000
indicate the version

1221
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,280
um and I guess even if it's

1222
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,579
even if we decide hey this is SMTP we

1223
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:43,440
could just have a different scheme in

1224
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,859
the URL and you could key off of that so

1225
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:50,160
so the URL is our negotiation mechanism

1226
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,420
here

1227
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,339
yes okay great

1228
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,880
yaron

1229
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:05,099
I'm probably missing something but if

1230
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,680
the URL determines the version doesn't

1231
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,619
that imply that you do need to have the

1232
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:14,040
intermediary server so that you have

1233
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,940
the URL

1234
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,500
yeah that's a good question I think

1235
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,059
we'll need to think on that a bit

1236
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:21,839
um

1237
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,359
yeah especially if we want to have it be

1238
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:25,980
available to expand into like device to

1239
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,240
device communication or something like

1240
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,880
that um

1241
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,160
maybe consider putting it into the

1242
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,780
credential format in some way definitely

1243
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,700
hi this is Nick I just want to comment

1244
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,220
on that as well um you know proprietary

1245
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,500
solution does not need to use URLs at

1246
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,420
all if it doesn't

1247
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,160
um want to go through the intermediary

1248
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,020
server so that'll be just left up to

1249
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,760
just you know the proprietary solution

1250
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,500
and its own versioning if it wants to

1251
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,720
negotiate that so you could do it over

1252
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,420
you know like nearby sharing or you know

1253
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,540
uh whatever Bluetooth or uwb or whatever

1254
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,619
it is that you want to do

1255
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,839
foreign

1256
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,180
any other questions

1257
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,020
from anyone

1258
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,220
we are yeah

1259
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,339
all right I think then uh we'll close it

1260
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:25,800
off and thank you everyone for coming we

1261
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,900
have some action items uh that we'll

1262
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,180
take from here and we'll continue the

1263
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,280
discussion on the meaning list

1264
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,040
have a great idea week thank you

1265
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,640
thank you

1266
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,980
foreign
