121
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560

122
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,860

00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,820
we want to talk a little bit about skim

149
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,160
for devices

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,459
um so uh next slide please

151
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,700
okay so here are some of the questions

152
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,080
uh that

153
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,880
um we have

154
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,580
uh and that are we think administrators

155
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,899
will have

156
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,120
and actually some

157
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,100
um of the business to business Community

158
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,660
will have

159
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,380
so how do I provision a new device into

160
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,899
Enterprise infrastructure or many new

161
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,820
devices into Enterprise infrastructure

162
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,220
and I might be

163
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,399
and an individual within the Enterprise

164
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,620
or a partner to that Enterprise

165
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,360
how do I

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,339
um establish bootstrapping credentials

167
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,620
for that device what are bootstrapping

168
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,959
credentials in this case a means by

169
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,540
which the device can be can be

170
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,320
introduced into the um Enterprise or

171
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,440
deployment environment in a way in which

172
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,740
uh in in some some notion of a secure

173
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,480
way and I'll talk a little bit about

174
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,660
what I mean by that in a little bit

175
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,000
um how can I provide ancillary

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,560
information about the device that's

177
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,320
being introduced into the environment

178
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,180
um one example of ancillary information

179
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,459
might be a software bill of materials

180
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,500
for that device another piece of

181
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,060
ancillary information might be in fact

182
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,519
what the device is

183
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,519
um another piece might be

184
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,640
um to leverage the manufacturer usage

185
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,500
descriptions

186
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,579
um

187
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,380
and then

188
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,040
um

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,300
the last question is how might I get

190
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,760
application API information

191
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,100
uh how might I exchange application API

192
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,380
information particularly for non-ip

193
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,540
enabled devices uh clarifying question

194
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,959
yeah just quick question this is when

195
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,060
you say device can you talk about what

196
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,760
what what do you mean by a device oh you

197
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,399
know let's say a

198
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,940
um a light bulb illuminaire a

199
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,040
refrigerator

200
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,920
um a good it's a good question a a thing

201
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,560
I I always talk in terms of things and

202
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
to me things are everything but general

203
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,300
purpose computers that have displays and

204
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,480
keyboards right we know how to add those

205
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,220
things onto networks we have great

206
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,320
difficulty adding

207
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,899
um non-things onto Network sort of weird

208
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,720
saying non-things but there you have it

209
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,339
uh so

210
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,380
um there's a class of device uh that

211
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,880
will require

212
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,540
um a data a data plane uh Communications

213
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,760
those are going to be uh devices that

214
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,980
are only L2 enabled

215
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,860
um and so they might want

216
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,519
uh uh information on API level

217
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,140
information on how to communicate with

218
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,240
those L2 devices so these are the

219
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,760
questions that we've come across next

220
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,180
slide please

221
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,839
so I sort of introduced this concept I

222
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,660
think it was in uh spring meeting

223
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,240
that we were thinking about skim for

224
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,579
this well yeah now we're really thinking

225
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,260
about skim we're thinking about it such

226
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,540
that a few of us have actually done some

227
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,839
prototyping and a little bit of coding

228
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,700
around this

229
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,519
um and why not right what we want is

230
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,560
something that skim largely speaking

231
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,899
provides a normalized set of schemas

232
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,899
starting with a very small base

233
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,579
um we don't want to really introduce

234
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,740
um any sort of Technology religion

235
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,100
around which onboarding Technologies are

236
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,079
in use but allow for all of them to be

237
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,839
used allow for all the bootstrapping

238
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,760
Technologies to be explored through

239
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,459
extension schemas

240
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,180
um and in the draft we provide a list of

241
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,160
examples and one of them is device

242
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,079
provisioning protocol we called it the

243
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,760
Wi-Fi schema but we probably should just

244
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,500
rename it the DPP scheme and I'll talk

245
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,760
about some of these things we need to

246
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,339
change we did something with ble low

247
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,360
energy

248
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,459
and with zigbee and we've tested out

249
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,200
these Technologies such that we can make

250
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,060
sure that they can interact with the

251
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,980
various components such that devices can

252
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,019
onboard onto a network

253
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,700
we're sort of looking for others like

254
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,160
what would we do for private 5G how

255
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,839
might this work for matter and things

256
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,880
like that

257
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,420
um

258
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,760
the table Stakes for for for creating

259
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,040
such a schema is to provide the

260
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,440
deployment enough information to get the

261
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,380
device to trust it and for it and so

262
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,180
that it knows to trust the device to

263
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,200
have that Mutual uh trust established

264
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,040
next slide please

265
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,839
so you might think there's got to be

266
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,959
other other things we could have used

267
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,700
um sort of the obvious one that people

268
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,560
start talking about is well couldn't you

269
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,040
have created a Yang model for all this

270
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,500
um and couldn't you have used netconf or

271
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,660
rest conf well in fact what we're

272
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,399
talking about here is something that

273
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,200
isn't provisioning or touching the

274
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,260
actual device but rather something that

275
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,360
is describing that device and

276
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,519
specifically describing

277
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,639
how to enable communication with that

278
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,399
device so it's a little bit different in

279
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,639
terms of the purpose of of netcap and

280
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,279
netconf and yang it's

281
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,000
um no device config is exchanged and

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,820
um there's no reusability here that we'd

283
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,220
be benefiting if we had gone to net comp

284
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,519
react so it's actually really right up

285
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,980
the alley of skim in terms of doing

286
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,040
provisioning operations as we said when

287
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,100
this working group was formed crud right

288
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,600
create read update and delete operations

289
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,279
um now the other choice might have been

290
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,899
SNMP and

291
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,360
um this was just in my in in in in in a

292
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,980
nightmare I had somebody said come and

293
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,920
come and do this with SNMP and and uh my

294
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,440
only response to that was no

295
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,519
so

296
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,680
um we're not going to do SNMP

297
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,500
so um that's why not other stuff next

298
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,920
slide please

299
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,000
okay so we have a couple of basic

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,160
elements that are in a core schema we

301
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,459
tried to roughly speaking stay aligned

302
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,820
with how skim was operating right you

303
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,860
have a very small core and then you

304
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,860
expand using extensions

305
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,740
um and so uh we have a couple of issues

306
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,600
that we have to resolve around how to do

307
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,920
that

308
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,839
um none of us who are doing this work

309
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,019
claim to be skim experts

310
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,500
um so ID and meta look a lot like what

311
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,899
they should be from core from the from

312
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,480
the original core schema admin state is

313
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,060
a little information about the device

314
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,339
schemas is from core connectivity

315
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:20,639
connectivity refers to how to connect to

316
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,320
the device what sort of connectivity the

317
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,760
device supports

318
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,540
a display name what the thing might be

319
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,180
right and um my URL and these are just

320
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,980
and you notice those last two are

321
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,600
optional because perhaps you don't even

322
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,500
have

323
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,259
you know much more information on that

324
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,019
these are sort of opening openers for us

325
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,300
as we begin this process with a working

326
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,699
group and we begin the dialogue to say

327
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,079
well maybe these are the things that

328
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,639
need to be in the court maybe these

329
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,560
things maybe these things shouldn't be

330
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,940
in device core they should just pull

331
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,560
back we should pull back and even make

332
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,800
the vice call Core even smaller these

333
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,540
are possibilities we we're really just

334
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,820
getting going

335
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,320
um so these are but this is what we

336
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,779
started with and embarrassingly the dash

337
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,819
zero zero of the draft forgot the core

338
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,520
which was sort of you know bad but that

339
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,319
was corrected today if you look at the

340
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
dash zero one it's got all these core

341
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,780
objects in in it apologies for that

342
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,619
next slide

343
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,480
so Elliot if I can Channel there's a

344
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,459
question on the um

345
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,880
chat from massimiliano Pala

346
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,980
um so he says you mentioned it's not net

347
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,740
conference conf for the device

348
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,140
that he agrees but wouldn't this be an

349
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,360
infrastructure configuration and as such

350
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,720
solvable using netcomf response

351
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,820
for the infrastructure

352
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,200
hi Max

353
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,000
um

354
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,940
maybe you could claim that but

355
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,720
um

356
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,960
the issue would be that this is really

357
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,179
high up the stack and net conference

358
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,460
comp really work at a much lower point

359
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,380
in the stock you could conf you could

360
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,780
think of it more as an analog as almost

361
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,020
like a a radius diameter analog if

362
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,760
anything

363
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,620
um so that's that's our thinking at

364
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,360
least and

365
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
um again we get no model reuse from net

366
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,940
conference conf in this case so from our

367
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,400
perspective I think we're we're more

368
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,380
comfortable in the skim world for this

369
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,260
it's exactly you know sort of the crud

370
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,059
operations that you would expect for

371
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,500
provisioning and we're not trying to do

372
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,480
things like describe interfaces or IP

373
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,059
addresses or any of that stuff and in

374
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:30,900
fact

375
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,980
the information we're communicating is

376
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,299
entirely devoid of deployment

377
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,039
information how the thing is being

378
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:41,520
deployed it's just what the thing is and

379
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
how to connect to it

380
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,700
okay yep uh I hope I hope that answers

381
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,660
your question Max thanks

382
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,220
so um

383
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,600
uh

384
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,900
is that leaf hi yes hi how are you I'm

385
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,539
good you good

386
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,299
um there's a there was significant work

387
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,840
in the Adrian Community towards uh Wi-Fi

388
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,000
schema or what you might call Wi-Fi

389
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,799
schema I mean they have a lot of

390
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,600
experience there about the challenges

391
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,539
and there there's a

392
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,940
there's a lot of dragons buried and

393
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,860
skeletons buried with respect to the

394
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,919
platform providers in that space I mean

395
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,179
if you're talking about deployability

396
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,520
here that it's going to be like really

397
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,440
really difficult

398
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,220
um

399
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,340
but um I I would encourage you to go

400
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,559
talk to them to go get a little bit of

401
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,299
sort of you know background information

402
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,080
on what kind of um well I would the

403
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
problems they ran into in that yeah so

404
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,380
before you walk away

405
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,780
I would just ask a favor which is put me

406
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,820
in touch with the right people uh yeah

407
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,799
absolutely drop me an email I'll do a

408
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,600
stick room put it on the top of my stack

409
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,640
but yeah that that's a very very useful

410
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,500
conversation to have

411
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,360
um on the other comment I was going to

412
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,820
make is that when I if I I think that if

413
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,400
you kind of put that kind of stuff

414
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,440
I mean Wi-Fi schema is about sort of

415
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,460
describing

416
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,840
you know what you need in order to

417
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,039
connect to the device right but

418
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,919
basically when you put that stuff back

419
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,000
into skim I I don't know how big of a

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,380
difference it will be

421
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,780
what netconf gets you today I think

422
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,039
you're going to wind up in more or less

423
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,720
the same place

424
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,700
okay

425
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,799
okay um I need to pause here for a

426
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,020
minute so for the gentleman

427
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,179
um we are following the ITF procedures

428
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,940
and a mask is required

429
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,559
thank you

430
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,140
okay so Elliot I don't know how much

431
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,000
more time you need but you're beyond the

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,460
10 minutes oh sorry about that no I mean

433
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,559
we've got plenty of time so hopefully

434
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,020
these are there's many unanswered

435
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,520
questions right now that we have to sort

436
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,660
through

437
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,340
um I'll just finish up relatively

438
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,660
briefly I was going to give you a few

439
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,460
more okay

440
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,280
um so first we know we have Phil and a

441
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,600
few others have already provided

442
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
comments we want to incorporate those

443
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,640
um we want to make sure we're using the

444
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,799
right schema description method like

445
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,260
right now it's

446
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,480
um we're using Json schema to describe

447
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,640
this stuff some people would prefer open

448
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,960
API

449
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,059
um in fact there's benefits of using

450
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,000
open API and that you can you can fold

451
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,039
comments onto two lines or three lines

452
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,140
or however many lines you want or

453
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,299
descriptions onto into those mini lines

454
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,580
and and as we all know Jason doesn't do

455
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,620
a good job of that and that particularly

456
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,059
now this might be the stupidest reason

457
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,799
in the world to do this but that makes

458
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,720
it rather hard to to just simply

459
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,100
incorporate something into an internet

460
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,140
draft for instance

461
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,200
um whereas open API is a lot easier

462
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,120
um we want to use the schema language

463
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,980
though we want to use a formal schema

464
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,720
language so that we can always make sure

465
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,580
that we're formally verifying correctly

466
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,799
right not having a formal schema

467
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,679
language would be very bad we think

468
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,080
um what needs to be normalized into and

469
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,880
out of the device core

470
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,980
is something that I think we need to pay

471
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,260
a lot of attention to

472
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,480
um and we already know that at least the

473
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,340
the Wi-Fi schema that we list and this

474
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,039
goes to leif's point is it's not really

475
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,740
a Wi-Fi schema it's really a

476
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,000
provisioning schema for device

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,820
provisioning protocol and

478
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,980
um so again it's more how does the

479
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,140
device get

480
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,480
introduced into the network and so we

481
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,820
could admit we can easily Envision not

482
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,539
just DPP but Fido device onboarding

483
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,400
might be another approach that could be

484
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,320
used in fact we've talked to the Fido

485
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,059
people about that

486
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,580
um and again as matter matures I would

487
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,320
expect that somebody will want to come

488
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,000
forward for a matter proposal right now

489
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
but matter today at least as published

490
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,260
doesn't suit the Enterprise maybe it

491
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,419
will and when it does then probably

492
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,740
we'll want to go down that route too

493
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,799
again no technology religion you know

494
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,539
maybe there's something to do with RFC

495
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,360
and e366 vouchers happy to go there

496
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,419
right the goal here is to do the a level

497
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,100
of introduction at least at the network

498
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,320
level and people want to to play at the

499
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,880
application Level later

500
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,700
that's a separate discussion as far as

501
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm concerned so that's it

502
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,679
I think I think I think that was my last

503
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,120
slide right

504
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
um

505
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,620
oh yeah proposed work fine well here's

506
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,419
information as to you know we're looking

507
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,640
for reviewers co-authors

508
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,700
um detractors

509
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,260
people people are free to take you know

510
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,020
to to submit PRS and would love to

511
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,299
discuss and maybe adopt something next

512
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,419
year early next year that's it that

513
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,080
really was it

514
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,900
okay hold on Danny Danny zalners in the

515
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,460
queue so if you want to get on the Queue

516
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,200
yeah I couldn't figure out how to do it

517
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,900
from the on oh okay so do it for my

518
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,760
phone we said we were gonna honor the uh

519
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,799
the meet Echo Q so Danny go ahead

520
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,640
hi Elliot uh I've got a well

521
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,700
um I've I've written the internet buddy

522
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,880
uh

523
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,840
sort of uh straighten out and uh

524
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,559
aligned like you know put your in the in

525
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,700
in a excuse me Danny uh maybe uh slow

526
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,380
down step a little bit away for you're

527
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,120
over modulating a little bit it's a

528
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,159
little hard to understand you oh

529
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,059
try again

530
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,360
uh testing yep we can hear you just a

531
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,580
little slower a little softer

532
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,840
uh yeah so to start

533
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,080
um I'd be happy to help you with the uh

534
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,179
representing the schema in the sort of

535
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,299
the skim schema language uh it's not

536
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,220
entirely straightforward but I've

537
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,539
written a few drafts already and I've

538
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,260
had to sort of crack that egg already

539
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,580
um so I can connect with you offline

540
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,900
just to give you some pointers on that

541
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,799
one

542
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,880
uh uh secondly

543
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,640
um I I think we'd already discussed this

544
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,140
a little over email but I'll mention it

545
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,179
here just for the record

546
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,299
um myself and a few other people have uh

547
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,700
sort of in parallel been looking at

548
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,640
doing or like uh representing

549
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,820
non-physical device or like machine

550
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,679
identities I think um

551
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,840
uh I don't know like any sort of like

552
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,940
workload Identity or a concert like a

553
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,440
service principle which might be like a

554
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,020
little like you know Azure or Microsoft

555
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,419
but uh you get the idea like a

556
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,260
non-tangible you cannot pick it up or

557
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,020
turn it on like a light bulb uh but you

558
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,760
know I like thing that has access to an

559
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,640
API so I I think we could potentially

560
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,500
write those two separate you know

561
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,840
completely separate graphs or you know

562
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,840
sort of figure out a way to uh just make

563
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
it like an extensional schemas of

564
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,320
because you're building this in a sort

565
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,760
of that Dynamic schema model

566
00:25:58,919 --> 00:25:59,760
um

567
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,880
I thought I had a third one but I have

568
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,820
forgotten so uh maybe that's just the

569
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,100
only two things that I talk about

570
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,700
it I'll be I'll briefly uh comment now

571
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,159
and then we'll take it offline to number

572
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,919
one absolutely welcome your help my

573
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,120
preference would be for that to be

574
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,860
non-normative whereas the formal would

575
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,539
be normative

576
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,500
um the and we can discuss that the on

577
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,679
the second point that you made about

578
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,059
Microsoft Azure workloads or other

579
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,980
things like that I think that's worthy

580
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,299
of discussion to make sure that we're

581
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,059
normalizing correctly and and happy to

582
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,220
take that forward with you as well

583
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,380
okay with that

584
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,679
thank you Elliot uh so I think you've

585
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,580
gotten some comments and uh for those

586
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,460
who have listened please solicit the

587
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,020
person who was in the queue left so I

588
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,320
presume you had no question left

589
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,179
um so just continue to provide feedback

590
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,700
and comment uh it looks like the authors

591
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,279
will continue to evolve the draft

592
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,039
and uh when they're ready

593
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,299
we can take a pulse then okay so next up

594
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,539
Pam we have you on the docket but we

595
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,179
didn't get a response from you didn't

596
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,340
know if you could give us an update on

597
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,960
the use cases

598
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,520
draft yeah can you hear me yes we can

599
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,980
okay great I have only a very small

600
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,539
update which is that I don't have a

601
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,880
draft for you but I do have a question

602
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,679
for the group if you're willing to have

603
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,299
me ask it

604
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,059
please I gave you five minutes I thought

605
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,559
so all right I just wanted to double

606
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,779
check so uh

607
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,720
in my in doing my research I rent into

608
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,279
an area in the specification that was

609
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
where I felt like the Implement

610
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
implementation was different from what

611
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,279
the specification stated and so I wanted

612
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,440
to ask this group about

613
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,720
external IDs

614
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,720
and provisioning domains it feels like

615
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
there's an echo on your side are you can

616
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,220
you hear me all right

617
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,799
we can hear you just fine

618
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,720
um you might be hearing some of the

619
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,580
issues because people are coming in and

620
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,559
out and the door is slamming oh that

621
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,919
could be okay so so provisioning domain

622
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,779
is defined in 7643 in section 1.2 so you

623
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,279
can all go take a look at it if you need

624
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,980
to but basically it is defined as an

625
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,140
administrative domain external to the

626
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,299
domain of a service provider for

627
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,400
different and and the example they give

628
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,919
is a different legal identity right so

629
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,980
they have defined provisioning domain is

630
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,380
basically external you know external

631
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,960
domains which may or may have one or

632
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,900
more clients I presume

633
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,179
so that's that's how the the

634
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,460
Define a provisioning domain and then in

635
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,740
section 3.1 when they Define an external

636
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,179
ID they defined that external ID as

637
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,740
being relative to The provisioning

638
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,820
Domain

639
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,100
and that there's a local mapping between

640
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,140
the provision the identifier of the

641
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,940
provisioning domain and the skim server

642
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,700
so the implication there is that there

643
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,559
should be a separate external ID for

644
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,140
every provisioning domain that a skim

645
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,460
server serves

646
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,620
except that I don't think any of our

647
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,539
implementations do that

648
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,880
so if you know if I have for example

649
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,100
especially in Downstream provisioning

650
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,679
where I might be where the skim server

651
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,200
for example could be in an AWS for

652
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,539
example right in Amazon

653
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:37,140
um I don't believe that there would be a

654
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,899
separate external ID managed for every

655
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,399
client

656
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,460
that wants to interact with a given

657
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,860
object of resource

658
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,899
so my question to this group and maybe

659
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,360
we can just answer it in the chat as

660
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,700
everyone else keeps going is is there

661
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,679
anyone here who runs a skim server that

662
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,919
is mapping different external IDs to

663
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,539
different provisioning domains

664
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Luigi

665
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,940
yeah nobody in the room is is

666
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,520
reacting to that question Pam the the

667
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,620
other suggestion for you would be to

668
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,440
post that question on the mail list yes

669
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,820
I will do that right after this

670
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,440
okay because I think if that's the case

671
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,960
I wouldn't include the ex you know then

672
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,720
external ID really only is used I

673
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,320
Believe by the client that creates it

674
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,539
but it can be changed by any client

675
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,980
if you know if the provisioning domain

676
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,960
separation is not maintained

677
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,240
right then you then one client could

678
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,340
could create an object with a given

679
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,740
external ID and then another client

680
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,360
could that could be from a completely

681
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,460
different provisioning domain may be

682
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,779
able to change that external ID

683
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,220
I guess my general question would be

684
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,260
would that be a good thing or not is it

685
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,100
at a desirable

686
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,140
right and if it is I I mean I think this

687
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,820
comes back to some of the cardinality

688
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,960
discussions

689
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,179
as well and and mutability right is

690
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,980
so I mean I I would I would pose that in

691
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,500
into the mail list as well

692
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,000
I mean okay

693
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,100
I can look at it from my flexibility but

694
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,279
I can also look at that as being a

695
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,539
a potential attack sector right

696
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,640
I would assume so yeah

697
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,919
yep okay thank you for for um

698
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,200
for all of your I mean not exactly on

699
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,460
participation but at least I know

700
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,100
there's not a lot of concern or

701
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,360
um yep different usages so thank you

702
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,620
okay

703
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,360
thanks Pam was that it

704
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,140
happened to me I I wrapped out though so

705
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,820
that people can review and I'm hoping we

706
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,600
can with luck adopt it for San Francisco

707
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,199
okay

708
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,299
okay with that

709
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,059
um we're into skim rolls and

710
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,500
entitlements Danny

711
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,360
well thank you Nancy uh let me know if

712
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,120
the audio is problematic again

713
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,179
yeah I think we

714
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:30,899
um

715
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,419
some of the the meet Echo folks did

716
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,279
notify the AV

717
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,679
part of the issue is you're coming in

718
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,360
Fairly loud

719
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,360
which may be causing

720
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,760
oh

721
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,000
okay give that a try Danny

722
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,899
uh testing

723
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,640
that's actually better

724
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,799
okay like I didn't feel like I was

725
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,440
talking that loud before so like it was

726
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,960
challenging for me to slow down and

727
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,580
this will okay good

728
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,659
I am muted

729
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,700
go ahead Danny

730
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,380
okay

731
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,820
um

732
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,399
so uh actually a bit out of order I

733
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,620
think the roles and entitlements uh

734
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,700
slides are a bit further so yeah we can

735
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,220
either go and yeah

736
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,559
um okay so yeah I've talked about this

737
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,019
draft in uh a little more uh I guess

738
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,019
informally at this of the previous ITF

739
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,659
sessions uh just once more to sort of go

740
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,460
over it it's also been sent out to the

741
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,000
mailing list previously uh so the draft

742
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,980
that's on the screen being shared right

743
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,000
now uh is a draft intended to add new

744
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,919
slash roles and slash entitlements

745
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,340
endpoints and Associated schemas so that

746
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,500
skim clients can discover the available

747
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,279
values uh that can be populated into the

748
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,740
user resources roles and entitlements

749
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,980
attributes uh and the the goal here is

750
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,280
so that the uh skim client interacting

751
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,260
with a skim server that uses roles and

752
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,739
or entitlements uh can proactively

753
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,960
determine what are the acceptable values

754
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,418
and what aren't uh that way it can be

755
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,699
more efficient uh and avoid sending

756
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,399
requests that will obviously fail uh

757
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,500
roles and entitlements both are some

758
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,440
attributes that are very frequently uh

759
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,719
sort of like validated where they only

760
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,000
accept a finite set of values as opposed

761
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,918
to just being an open string that you

762
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,080
can put whatever value you'd like into

763
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,839
uh so this draft is uh has just recently

764
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,719
been put into a call for adoption uh so

765
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,699
I found it really really this slide was

766
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,639
just a sort of reminder and a uh call to

767
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,699
our call for assistance or whatever in

768
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,520
uh if you you know have implemented skim

769
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,040
and you use roles and or entitlements uh

770
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,020
or you think you might in the future uh

771
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,240
please review this draft uh provide

772
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,359
feedback on uh you know I guess the the

773
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,099
substance of it uh if you think it's

774
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,619
implementable useful Etc

775
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,520
uh and then finally there's a few other

776
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,900
uh opportunities that have come both

777
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,300
from feedback in the mailing list uh you

778
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,740
know feedback from other meetings that

779
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,780
I've had that I just uh I figured I'd

780
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,160
cover here

781
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,579
um I've gotten feedback that

782
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:28,200
uh there may be some interest in

783
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,079
expanding these roles and entitlements

784
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,900
resources to have a member's attribute

785
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,420
similar to a group uh to essentially

786
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,980
create almost like a a two mode system

787
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,880
of managing roles uh so if it's one user

788
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,859
and you're trying to add you know 20 new

789
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,380
roles to them you can patch user dot

790
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,800
roles uh whereas if there's one new role

791
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
for instance and you want to go add a

792
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,000
large number of users to be a member to

793
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,980
that you could add them directly into

794
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,820
the roles dot members uh attribute you

795
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,660
know

796
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,400
but obfuscating away the fact that you

797
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,320
know you'd have to go Target the correct

798
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,440
uh you know role inside of that uh

799
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,500
but I I've seen similar actual uh

800
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,040
similar thoughts recently even around

801
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,480
um some other things as well I guess

802
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,599
uh uh like uh users.groups as a

803
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,640
suggestion you know people who have

804
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
implemented skin clients or skim servers

805
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,960
uh wanting the ability to uh you know if

806
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,020
you're going to go add a user to 50 new

807
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,760
groups right now you have to make 50 new

808
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,440
pass requests or you know do a bulk

809
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,200
request so it's an interesting uh I

810
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,760
guess Dynamic not only for roles and

811
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,440
entitlements but potentially something

812
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,839
for us to consider for a uh you know a

813
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,460
future version of this Kim standard as

814
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,720
well if we were to uh expand the uh the

815
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
capabilities inside of the core schema

816
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,339
protocols or the core schema

817
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,859
specification rather

818
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,920
um there's I think also

819
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,380
um there's probably a need

820
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,640
for uh whether in this draft or in a

821
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,480
revision of the uh the the the core

822
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,920
schema uh RC to

823
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,280
provide a little bit clearer guidance on

824
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,480
uh usage of the sub attributes uh inside

825
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,640
of the roles and entitlements attributes

826
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,060
uh with specific focus on type although

827
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,619
I think primary could use it a little

828
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,960
bit as well

829
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,540
um right now I I don't think it's very

830
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,240
clear to implementers uh on what the

831
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,960
type attribute is meant to represent uh

832
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,040
and

833
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,599
there are some implementations where

834
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,300
I've seen where I think it like they're

835
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,480
what they've landed on makes sense uh

836
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,680
but it would be nice to actually have

837
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,920
explicit guidance as right now any

838
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,000
complex attribute in the schema or at

839
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,940
least most of them uh I I don't want to

840
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,280
say any but uh most of the complex

841
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,579
attributes in the skim core schema RC

842
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:12,060
have the same set of sub attributes you

843
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,660
know type primary value display

844
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:19,200
uh but you know across emails addresses

845
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,300
actually no addresses doesn't fall into

846
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,980
that so

847
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,480
um you know roles entitlements all

848
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,940
others I I think there's potentially

849
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,220
different uses for each of them so

850
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,160
uh and then

851
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,440
uh I guess one final thing that was also

852
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,720
came up of sort of representing with

853
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,900
those roles and entitlements resources

854
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,940
um things that are either prerequisites

855
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,880
so you know in order to have role a you

856
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,740
must have already assigned this user

857
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,400
role b or B or you know assign it at the

858
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,339
same time and then sort of the opposite

859
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,339
of this role cannot be granted if this

860
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,920
other role is also there or you know you

861
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,599
can shift that over to entitlements as

862
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,339
well

863
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,280
um so I'll probably include uh summer

864
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,320
all of those other opportunities in the

865
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,200
next version of the draft which I guess

866
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,020
may come after the call for adoption uh

867
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,339
finishes

868
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,380
but uh yeah if anybody has any uh

869
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,599
questions or feedback I'd love to hear

870
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,220
them either here or on the mailing list

871
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,640
or privately

872
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,960
yeah I mean just as a reminder we did we

873
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,940
put out a call for adoption call for

874
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,099
interest for this draft so

875
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,200
the idea is for you to provide comments

876
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,540
on the current draft and to assess

877
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,400
Readiness for adoption

878
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,180
and I think I put the the end for the

879
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,460
call for adoption towards the end of the

880
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,020
month trying to give us an extra week

881
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,300
given that we're here

882
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,160
yeah it was something like November 28th

883
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,859
or 30th yeah I tried to give it an extra

884
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,280
week or so just because we

885
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,920
were meeting here

886
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,119
okay

887
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,460
yeah uh that's all I've got for roles

888
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,020
and entitlements uh I forget the order

889
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,220
of things but oh well I yeah I gave I

890
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,540
put them in the order that you gave them

891
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,440
to me yeah the next one is the reference

892
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,760
value

893
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,079
um and location

894
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,240
all right so you can just scroll up one

895
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,920
cool

896
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,740
um yeah so the Strat is a bit rougher

897
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,480
still

898
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,900
um so I

899
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,240
previously I've faced a challenge and

900
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,760
this is actually a very similar in what

901
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,859
the intent is behind that roles and

902
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,020
entitlements draft

903
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,599
um where attributes

904
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,079
that are present on a resource

905
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,320
um may only accept values from you know

906
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,740
from a predefined list uh no just as you

907
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,740
know an example the like the Enterprise

908
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,820
user attribute cost centers well you

909
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,200
know business is generally predefine

910
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,700
their cost centers and I shouldn't be

911
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,619
able to go type in you know banana or

912
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,480
purple and put that as the value for

913
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,700
cost center it's not going to be uh

914
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,560
helpful for whatever Downstream system

915
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,760
is consuming that data uh so this draft

916
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,060
adds a few new attributes to the schema

917
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,820
definitions that's the urn iitf params

918
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,880
skim schemas core 2.0 schema so it has

919
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,619
to be properties that Define any given

920
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,619
attribute and those properties

921
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:25,079
um eventually allow you to uh

922
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,380
communicate and say this attribute from

923
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,240
a it only accepts a limited set of

924
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,619
values versus just you know accepting

925
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:32,760
anything

926
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,640
and those values are searchable uh based

927
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,200
on XYZ resources attribute you know a r

928
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,079
b or c or whatever so you know the user

929
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:46,140
dot manager are the users at the user

930
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,839
resources manager dot value sub

931
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,420
attribute only accepts values of the

932
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,720
user resources ID attribute

933
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,920
um this is actually you know it's

934
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,400
explained in the skim schema like RFC

935
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,560
but it's only explained sort of in in

936
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,880
text and not in a like a machine

937
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,640
understandable way and so the seems to

938
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,440
provide a sort of a automatable

939
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,260
discoverable way to handle that

940
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,500
uh and uh I I see Dean has his hand up

941
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,359
yeah I was gonna say Dean's done the

942
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,660
cube

943
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:22,020
hi Dean sacks from Amazon Danny um I

944
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,060
noticed there was no way to filter like

945
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,099
in your manager example like on a

946
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,859
parameter is a manager or is in a

947
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,240
certain role

948
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,180
um is that something you see you want to

949
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,280
add to the spec at some point because I

950
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,880
see a need in a large system where I may

951
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,040
not want every user to come back as a

952
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,660
potential manager in this referential

953
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,400
value I want to get a subset of those

954
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,140
users so is that something you're

955
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,520
looking at or is that something we would

956
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,800
add somewhere else

957
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,359
so I think that would probably be

958
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,619
something that you could add somewhere

959
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,700
else perhaps as a a new attribute either

960
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,200
in you know the core or I guess it would

961
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,060
be in what the Enterprise schema

962
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,440
extension or just a new extension in

963
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,960
itself uh something you know it could be

964
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,480
a Boolean like is manager

965
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
um I think this draft is aiming to be a

966
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,280
little more agnostic where you know

967
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,740
manager is the super easy example based

968
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,240
on you know what exists in the spec

969
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,740
today

970
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,500
um I I off the top of my head I don't

971
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,760
know how

972
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,280
uh like how we would incorporate that

973
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,319
into just these few attributes or like

974
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:26,940
you know schema properties that are

975
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,579
there but I I think it's a very valid uh

976
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,440
you know problem to go solve probably

977
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,060
just with a Boolean or something yeah

978
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,220
Danny I guess if you took it took a step

979
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,380
back and instead of looking at like an

980
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,119
is manager attribute just a general

981
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,420
filtering capability so that when you

982
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,300
are looking for those referential values

983
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,520
um you are able to filter that to a

984
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,800
certain subset of all values as opposed

985
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,800
to every in the in the case of managers

986
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,180
and you're looking at all the users

987
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,920
instead of returning all of these as

988
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,319
return users who meet a certain set of

989
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,880
characteristics

990
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,440
oh

991
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,240
yeah I

992
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,220
I I

993
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,740
see it now okay

994
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,579
yeah I I won't have to like try to like

995
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:14,220
solve the problem live here but I I

996
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,920
understand what you're saying and I

997
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,839
think there are probably solutions to

998
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:19,920
that

999
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,420
great thank you

1000
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,060
yeah thank you for feedback

1001
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,940
I was gonna say it seems like Dane

1002
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,740
you're asking more in the search or

1003
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,819
query

1004
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,460
which may be a different draft so

1005
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,700
there's there's the um

1006
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,400
so Danny it gets to the question of can

1007
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,839
that be achieved through the cursor

1008
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,240
paging I know it can be achieved through

1009
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,300
the skim events potentially right right

1010
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,280
and then so the yeah the question I

1011
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,079
guess is where does it get pulled in

1012
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,579
does it get pulled in here does it get

1013
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,319
pulled in somewhere else uh happy to

1014
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,180
work with Danny offline on this

1015
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,920
thank you you might reach out to Phil

1016
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,920
hunt too so he's got some experience and

1017
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,660
yeah

1018
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,819
all right

1019
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,760
yeah and then uh just to sort of finish

1020
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,460
this Slide the topic off

1021
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,440
um actually out of a conversation that I

1022
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,720
was having last week with Dean and a few

1023
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,140
other people uh there's sort of a

1024
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,420
broader question and I'll pose this out

1025
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,720
to the mailing list as well uh but are

1026
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,180
there other new schema properties that

1027
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,060
are needed uh the example that you know

1028
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,220
came to the top of the discussion that

1029
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,780
we were having last week was around

1030
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,380
cardinality uh so for mult and I hope

1031
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,900
I'm using the right word there but uh

1032
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,420
for multi-valued attributes

1033
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,760
uh so we we have the ability to say is

1034
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,380
something single valued or is it

1035
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,839
multi-valued but for multi-valued

1036
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:46,980
attributes we do not have a way to

1037
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,960
express how many values it can accept

1038
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,599
like you could you can you can accept uh

1039
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,400
you know two different values for emails

1040
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,660
for instance it's a multi-valued

1041
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,040
attribute but maybe you don't want to

1042
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,160
accept infinite values for emails

1043
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,500
um and even Beyond cardinality I think

1044
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,300
there's probably

1045
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,140
other things that are worth looking into

1046
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,819
trying to represent but we I think we

1047
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:11,700
then also are going to get into the

1048
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,420
problem of like over complicating things

1049
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,720
perhaps so it's I think it's a uh up in

1050
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,040
line to

1051
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,420
e or whatever the expression is

1052
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,579
you've got Pam on the Queue by the way

1053
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,660
uh yeah go ahead Pam

1054
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,280
so I do have another question about the

1055
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,619
referential value I mean it obviously in

1056
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,060
a programming language this would be a

1057
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,460
variable right again and it would

1058
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,920
populate a drop down really the way that

1059
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,900
you've framed this

1060
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,900
um are you it is also a call out to what

1061
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,780
could be a completely foreign server

1062
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,560
so do you feel like there's security

1063
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,119
limitations that need to be added to

1064
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,160
this draft so that for example you could

1065
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,960
only perform a get on the same skin

1066
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,880
server that

1067
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,520
is hosting that the API

1068
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,859
um the way that this draft is written it

1069
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:12,300
only allows for describing uh uh like

1070
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,020
that that referential value uh if it is

1071
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,180
represented on the skin on the same skim

1072
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,920
endpoint either on the same resource

1073
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,980
type or another resource type I hadn't

1074
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,520
actually considered the problem of like

1075
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,460
representing the data somewhere else or

1076
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,800
like I sort of had at least of it's a

1077
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,220
possibility but I I didn't attempt to

1078
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,740
solve that or you can really cover it at

1079
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,180
all inside of this draft because it was

1080
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,700
more complicated than I uh had the

1081
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,859
energy or brain power to attempt to

1082
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,940
solve when I was writing this

1083
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,240
so yeah I guess the the sort of

1084
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,560
lingering question which I will again

1085
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,599
you know post to the uh the working

1086
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,119
group would be uh

1087
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,420
are there like is there a need for a

1088
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,599
more descriptive set of properties on

1089
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,319
the schema like properties definition

1090
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,599
uh and maybe should this draft either

1091
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,339
this draft directly or you know a new

1092
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:21,599
draft uh startup to try to solve that

1093
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,880
broader problem if there's actually

1094
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,700
agreement that it is a problem

1095
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,980
uh and yeah that's all I have on this

1096
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,280
topic

1097
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,940
so Danny I'm presuming

1098
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,660
prison involving the draft right

1099
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,099
feedback and comments

1100
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,560
yes before we can do an adoption okay

1101
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,880
okay yeah I'm not looking to put this up

1102
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,460
for adoption quite yet yep well it

1103
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,599
sounds like that

1104
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,819
okay

1105
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,099
so if you're done with that one uh we're

1106
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,859
into the last one cursor paging

1107
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:56,160
yep we are

1108
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,119
um I do not see Matt Peterson on the

1109
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,460
call unfortunately

1110
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,800
uh that is correct

1111
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,280
yes I will uh attempt to represent this

1112
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,380
one myself

1113
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,160
uh so if you could uh sorry you have two

1114
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,680
slides for this which uh start with the

1115
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,940
top ones or scroll up twice

1116
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,900
is that right uh

1117
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,420
yeah that is the correct one

1118
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,500
uh okay so status update on cursor based

1119
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,300
pagination

1120
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,480
um we have a version 01 draft uh which

1121
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,640
is published uh the version zero zero

1122
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,440
was published back in I think it was

1123
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,500
2017 and just recently within the past

1124
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,920
you know six to 12 months or so has uh

1125
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,900
it become a little more popular and it's

1126
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,280
it's sort of become the Talk of the Town

1127
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,680
uh if you just look at how much time we

1128
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,000
spent the last two skim meetings

1129
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,500
actually

1130
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,980
um so version 01 added some uh like just

1131
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,920
like syntax fixes in the examples where

1132
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,599
um or you know certain things that

1133
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,880
should be there were missing

1134
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,560
um like uh like what is it like the

1135
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,480
total results counter that sort of thing

1136
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,040
like uh just very like Baseline sort of

1137
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,900
boring fixes

1138
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,780
um and then a few new changes were made

1139
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,660
based on feedback on the mailing list uh

1140
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,380
a previous cursor uh attribute or object

1141
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,819
parameter uh was added which uh you know

1142
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,200
essentially you can now bi-directionally

1143
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,900
go back and forth uh if the

1144
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,520
implementation you know decides to

1145
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,619
implement previous cursor uh rather than

1146
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:37,380
only moving forward

1147
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,119
um and then we've made some changes to

1148
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,119
the uh service provider config uh entry

1149
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:45,240
goes to uh better describe does

1150
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,559
the uh does this game server support uh

1151
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,839
index-based pagination cursor-based

1152
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,480
pagination uh or both or I guess

1153
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,800
potentially neither although that one

1154
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,079
seems really messy

1155
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:58,740
um

1156
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,180
there we uh Matt and I sort of want to

1157
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,960
so like this draft specifically outlines

1158
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,520
cursor-based pagination

1159
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,460
um but we also wanted to have some

1160
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,480
flavor of just being like an expanding

1161
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,400
of pagination in general and so like

1162
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,800
adding the new service provider uh

1163
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,540
config information that actually also

1164
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,599
lets you detail uh you know things that

1165
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:26,819
may only you may only actually support

1166
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:29,520
index-based pagination uh but even just

1167
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,200
being able to you know outline that and

1168
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,119
make it discoverable uh we think is

1169
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,760
helpful for the uh the big picture and

1170
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,660
discoverability and all of that

1171
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,940
uh and starting with version 01 uh I've

1172
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,400
joined as a co-author on this alongside

1173
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,599
Matt Peterson

1174
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,880
uh we are currently working on a version

1175
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,420
O2 that I think will come out shortly uh

1176
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,819
maybe maybe this week or you know next

1177
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,160
week or whichever

1178
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,760
um so if you have any feedback on

1179
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,780
cursor-based pagination either the

1180
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,420
version 01 or you know the O2 that comes

1181
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,680
out uh version like version 02 won't be

1182
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,140
massively different from o1

1183
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,720
um we would love to hear it

1184
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,819
um and if you could uh Aaron move down

1185
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:16,140
to the next

1186
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,098
uh slide

1187
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,599
uh so at the request of the chairs uh So

1188
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,059
for anybody who's attended uh any of the

1189
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,079
last few uh it's like ietf skim meetings

1190
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,319
uh we have spent a substantial amount of

1191
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,000
time debating uh sort of the necessity

1192
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,839
of a an expansion to pagination uh

1193
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,480
whether or not there is overlap with the

1194
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,819
currently adopted skim events draft

1195
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:51,059
which profiles uh security event tokens

1196
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:54,780
plus uh plus skim you sort of nested as

1197
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,700
a payload inside and then I've also

1198
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,460
thrown in uh because it's become a more

1199
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,599
relevant and you know it's always been

1200
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,760
part of this conversation as well

1201
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,260
um the concept of any sort of like

1202
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,740
change text or a Delta query mechanic uh

1203
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,140
which there is no draft for but uh there

1204
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,880
either is intention to

1205
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,700
uh right at some point in the future

1206
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,579
so uh previously expressed concerns uh

1207
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:20,040
about the coexistence of these drafts uh

1208
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,079
specifically uh pagination skim events

1209
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,880
we'll focus on right now

1210
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,680
uh has been that pagination uh so this

1211
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,480
would be uh the other side of the

1212
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,359
argument uh not the one that I support

1213
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:36,059
uh would be that pagination uh or you

1214
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,260
know a larger like cursor-based

1215
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,780
imagination model is unnecessary because

1216
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,680
if a large set of results are present uh

1217
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,480
you can actually just feed them all

1218
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,180
those sort of like piecemeal through uh

1219
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,579
an event stream as outlined in skim

1220
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:51,540
events

1221
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,460
uh this doesn't actually

1222
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,559
solve like it's not suitable for a lot

1223
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,960
of scheme implementations

1224
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,640
um and so I've sort of tried to profile

1225
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,819
the pros and cons or you know like the

1226
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:08,220
the relevant points of each of these

1227
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,599
models

1228
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,400
so

1229
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,880
uh with uh a cursor-based pagination uh

1230
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,900
I should probably not have just called

1231
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,520
the top one pagination that's a little

1232
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,260
vague

1233
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,059
um so it's very helpful for an efficient

1234
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:23,520
retrieval of results either a subset of

1235
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,859
results you know based on a query or all

1236
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:26,760
results

1237
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,900
uh it is needed for clients to be able

1238
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,000
to efficiently get like that initial set

1239
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,559
of data so let's say you're a skim

1240
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,300
client and you're getting your data for

1241
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,220
the first time

1242
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,940
um how do you I guess it's

1243
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,099
it's just it's not the sort of the right

1244
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,640
model in you know Matt and I's opinion

1245
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,220
to try to feed that all through a skim

1246
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,380
event Hub uh it also requires

1247
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,720
substantially more uh like

1248
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,339
infrastructure investment you need

1249
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:58,319
inbound connectivity rules as in our

1250
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,740
inbound connectivity like flow as a

1251
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,200
server running and all that stuff as a

1252
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,240
skim client which today a client can

1253
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,280
operate entirely just with outbound

1254
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,440
connectivity

1255
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,940
um and what do you so when you're

1256
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,680
whether you're trying to sort of see

1257
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,720
that initial set of data or just if

1258
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,160
you're running an application or a

1259
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,440
service and uh

1260
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,599
uh you've had an issue like who who

1261
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,579
hasn't had a bug or a regression or

1262
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,740
something like that and your your data

1263
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,000
is no longer trustworthy and you need to

1264
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,500
pull it again

1265
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,359
um being able to just do like a get

1266
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:33,780
slash users and paginate them is sort of

1267
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,700
much more efficient and reliable and

1268
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,839
honestly simpler than uh you know

1269
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,800
hooking up an event stream and trying to

1270
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,280
flow it all through

1271
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:49,400
um so that being said we we do actually

1272
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,079
see the value in scale of events it's

1273
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,660
probably just in a narrower use case

1274
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,920
that has been argued in some of our

1275
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,900
previous meetings

1276
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,420
um so skill events essentially reverses

1277
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,420
the flow uh for anybody familiar uh it

1278
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,000
reverses the flow of

1279
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,940
the uh sure that traditional like client

1280
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,800
server model whereas normally the client

1281
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,599
is reaching out to the server it's

1282
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,579
making requests and if it doesn't ask

1283
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,099
for something it's not going to find out

1284
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:21,720
so if a like a a connection is set up

1285
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,480
for like a sort of a backflow of events

1286
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,880
from what would normally be considered a

1287
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,920
skim server or service provider back

1288
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,540
down to the party that would normally be

1289
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,559
the client

1290
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,260
uh that allows the skim service provider

1291
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,180
to

1292
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,680
reach out to the client and tell them

1293
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,800
hey this thing has happened and this you

1294
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,000
know it's sort of you know configurable

1295
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,920
to like what level of uh you know

1296
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,380
sensitivity you want but

1297
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,660
um the super like useful use case that

1298
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,180
we see oh that's a useful use case

1299
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,160
um that we see is

1300
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,380
uh around sort of that those urgent high

1301
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,079
priority changes so let's say that an

1302
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,780
account needs to be disabled so in the

1303
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,300
in the conversation of uh like

1304
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,520
provisioning data from some sort of

1305
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,500
Human Resources system or a human

1306
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,420
resources connected system

1307
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,240
uh into you know really anywhere else

1308
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,020
Downstream uh if HR wants to send a

1309
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,420
signal that says hey this user has been

1310
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,859
terminated

1311
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:24,480
that that's an urgent thing you know

1312
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,040
sometimes terminations are you know

1313
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,960
hostile you can look like layoffs that

1314
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,920
have happened at so many companies

1315
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,500
recently and being able to you know have

1316
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,960
the server side or notify the client of

1317
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,940
hey either just this change has happened

1318
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,859
because they can explicitly say you know

1319
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,440
uh uh like account you know they are no

1320
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,359
longer like they've been terminated uh

1321
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,700
or they can just say this object has had

1322
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,940
an update and you should check it again

1323
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,700
uh either way it sort of it solves that

1324
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,440
problem and you can expand that out to

1325
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,700
things like you know password changes

1326
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,380
which could in turn trigger you know

1327
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,200
invalidating you know existing tokens in

1328
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,480
a service or whichever uh you can expand

1329
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,740
out further maybe just somebody's you

1330
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,000
know display name or whatever if you

1331
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,880
want to actually use that you can use

1332
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,700
that mechanism to notify of changes

1333
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,559
um like ahead of time

1334
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,460
and the uh like some of the feedback

1335
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,599
that uh I I've managed to solicit

1336
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,920
uh it pretty much says this is not

1337
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,599
universally implementable

1338
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,940
so uh the inbound connectivity

1339
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,480
requirements are uh similarity and

1340
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,700
off-putting and a deal breaker for some

1341
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,680
implementations like some clients do not

1342
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,559
want to have you know to open up inbound

1343
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,160
connectivity uh there's the costs both

1344
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,020
from like a development standpoint and

1345
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,220
you know infrastructure operational

1346
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,400
standpoint of running the like shared

1347
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,040
signals and event like the the the the

1348
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,780
things that would like receive these

1349
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,540
events and store them and all of that uh

1350
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,220
it's just it it's making things more

1351
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,140
complicated and that increased

1352
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,220
complexity is concerning and I'll stop

1353
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,559
there I see Daryl uh has raised hand in

1354
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:03,180
the queue

1355
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,720
hi Daryl Miller Microsoft

1356
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,359
um it's just worth you know we do pretty

1357
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,460
much this at scale uh with Microsoft

1358
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,220
graph API across all kinds of different

1359
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,400
resources and we actually combine events

1360
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,780
in Delta query because one of the

1361
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,160
challenges with events is that you're a

1362
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,020
you're sending data over the wire so you

1363
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,180
need to be secure about where you're

1364
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,000
sending that data and be a customer

1365
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,619
who's receiving it could drop it on the

1366
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,559
floor and then they've lost that event

1367
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:36,859
whereas if you you send some events just

1368
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:40,260
events saying this has changed you can

1369
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,059
then re have the client come back with

1370
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:44,220
Delta query and say oh you said

1371
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,079
something has changed what has changed

1372
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,520
since I last queried it so it might be

1373
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,460
worth looking at those two things more

1374
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,200
in combination or at least that's a

1375
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,240
pattern that we've found works well

1376
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,640
where people want very reliable and

1377
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,420
efficient uh way of getting

1378
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,799
notifications as long as the scale

1379
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,020
doesn't get too too high because you do

1380
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,900
have to make you have to receive

1381
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,059
the event and then make the secondary

1382
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:14,420
query

1383
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,140
but we should talk more

1384
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,480
yes we should uh I'm hearing you

1385
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,299
volunteer to help author a skim Delta

1386
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:23,480
query draft

1387
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,160
yeah I was like okay so you're proposing

1388
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,140
the third one Delta query

1389
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,240
but but it's useful for you to note that

1390
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,618
as a practitioner right

1391
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,040
yeah

1392
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,079
um and then yeah just a few key points

1393
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:39,540
on sort of the the why of uh like a

1394
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,460
Delta query

1395
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,180
um so it's it it's needed for

1396
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,680
synchronization we'll call them use

1397
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,339
cases uh to help improve efficiency uh

1398
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:55,380
so using the use case of uh like a an

1399
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,599
identity provider you know Azure ad OCTA

1400
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,280
whichever

1401
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,640
um is connected into a

1402
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,119
Human Resources provider and the human

1403
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,819
resource provider is providing

1404
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:11,460
uh all of the user information that in

1405
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,079
turn is used to make decisions about

1406
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,000
does an account get created updated

1407
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,460
deleted you know any any of those

1408
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,319
uh for when you start hitting really

1409
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,660
large scale companies with hundreds of

1410
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,180
thousands or you know millions of uh

1411
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,859
users in their HR System you know

1412
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:28,460
between you know contractors and whatnot

1413
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:32,220
you run into issues where honestly even

1414
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,200
skim events it's going to be like a fire

1415
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,640
hose

1416
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,319
um

1417
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,780
and just purely doing like let's say a

1418
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,119
get slash users web you know paginated

1419
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,299
or if you're getting the raw set of data

1420
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:46,920
um if you're doing get slash users and

1421
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,240
there's a million users that clearly

1422
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,280
doesn't work so you need the pagination

1423
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,520
but even then even if you're trying to

1424
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,500
paginate a set of a million users and

1425
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,819
you really only want the ones that have

1426
01:01:56,819 --> 01:01:59,460
changed you you need that ability to

1427
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,540
just say give me the ones that have

1428
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,760
changed since you know the last time I

1429
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,040
asked for this

1430
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,200
um and between you know the various

1431
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,700
concerns about skim events and really

1432
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,240
just I think problems of scale

1433
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,900
this is not like uh you skim events in

1434
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,660
place of a Delta query isn't something

1435
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:22,140
that Matt and I see as being feasible

1436
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,640
excuse me

1437
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,980
um and I I've seen I've uh you know

1438
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,240
solicited other feedback that also

1439
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,180
aligns there so I just sort of covering

1440
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,920
where our minds are at

1441
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,140
uh and as far as solving the Delta query

1442
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,960
problem uh

1443
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,900
I don't know that either matter is

1444
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,220
especially me

1445
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,280
um are the right people are at least the

1446
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,440
only people you know I think we need a

1447
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,180
larger set of people involved to solve

1448
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,880
this this is a slightly more complicated

1449
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,020
technical challenge than some of the

1450
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,839
other ones perhaps uh but the current

1451
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:57,660
front runner of ideas to solve it seems

1452
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,520
to be some sort of Watermark based

1453
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,780
system

1454
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,400
um with you know some sort of a fake

1455
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,500
token representing uh from the service

1456
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,640
writer uh when that uh you know to

1457
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,160
return all changes since X

1458
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,119
uh and that takes favor over just going

1459
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,480
off of say uh the what is it a meta dot

1460
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,940
last modified uh because especially in

1461
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:24,059
distributed Cloud systems you can uh run

1462
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:27,000
into problems where uh small amounts of

1463
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,339
time drift can create inconsistent

1464
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,260
results um essentially you know time in

1465
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,559
most of these systems is uh not uh

1466
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,839
what's the word uh monotonically uh

1467
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,059
increasing

1468
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:41,579
and uh because of that just it's better

1469
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,400
instead of using a an actual like date

1470
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,240
time to use uh that opaque token that

1471
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,680
may ultimately you know still represent

1472
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,540
a date time internally

1473
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,380
um but it gives a little more

1474
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,420
flexibility and uh you know for the

1475
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,359
implementer to provide uh the token

1476
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,460
which in turn can behind the scenes lead

1477
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,220
to whatever the most uh sort of reliable

1478
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,299
results are

1479
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:06,599
um

1480
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:10,260
so yeah hopefully that was helpful to

1481
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,359
people this one doesn't really have a

1482
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:14,460
direct like request for feedback

1483
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,319
although if anybody has you know

1484
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,119
feedback or thoughts or whatever uh

1485
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:20,579
happy to hear them this conversation has

1486
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,440
also mostly been I think covered over

1487
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,420
the mailing list in a long series of

1488
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,880
emails

1489
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,420
uh I believe that uh no I think I

1490
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,220
already said uh for pagination I I think

1491
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,079
we'll uh within the next few weeks or a

1492
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,299
month or whichever uh we may try to put

1493
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:38,760
this up uh for a call for adoption as

1494
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,880
well

1495
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:50,119
uh and that is all I have

1496
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,720
did you want to talk about your upcoming

1497
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,420
work slide oh yes I forgot about that

1498
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,880
slide uh

1499
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,400
thank you

1500
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,339
laughs uh

1501
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:11,040
yeah so um just as a uh sort of a high

1502
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,020
level overview

1503
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:17,099
um so I've been trying to sort of help

1504
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,220
make sure that we're making progress on

1505
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,859
a lot of the various items that exist in

1506
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:25,260
the working groups Charter

1507
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,819
um so some of the you know previous

1508
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:28,740
drafts are covering pieces some of them

1509
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,260
are a little bit of a stretch uh you

1510
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,940
know we use that one mind about the just

1511
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,460
you know extended schemas and uh and go

1512
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,160
from there solve problems uh but some of

1513
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,339
the upcoming work that uh I at least

1514
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:44,339
intend to focus on and try to generate

1515
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,760
draft for uh and I'm you know being

1516
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,380
public about this year because if

1517
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,480
anybody is interested in any of these uh

1518
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,400
please for the love of your deity of

1519
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,200
choice uh reach out and we can uh we can

1520
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,260
work together uh so uh Human Resources

1521
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,839
schema uh essentially a generalized

1522
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:03,180
Human Resources uh like a worker or

1523
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,880
employee representation uh intentionally

1524
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,940
at least what I and what you know based

1525
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,579
on what I've know and have learned this

1526
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:13,140
should not just be an extension to the

1527
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,960
user schema because a worker or an

1528
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,460
employee or you know whatever your label

1529
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:21,059
is uh may be different from a user like

1530
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:23,880
a a human being in an HR System does not

1531
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,400
mean that One account is created for

1532
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,440
them it could be zero accounts could be

1533
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,960
one could be fifty uh and just providing

1534
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,760
that you know employee data and then

1535
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,980
letting the connected systems decide how

1536
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,539
to you know

1537
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:39,500
uh react to that uh is is the goal there

1538
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,839
and uh you know the the Uber goal for

1539
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:45,240
the human resources uh schema is to

1540
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,640
actually standardize how HR providers

1541
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,920
can represent their data uh which will

1542
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,200
in turn allow you know any HR provider

1543
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,880
whether it's a really big one whether

1544
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,680
it's a new startup uh they don't have to

1545
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,960
go design their own API uh they don't

1546
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,880
have to go design their own you know API

1547
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,559
schema or anything but then they also

1548
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,720
get the benefit of even if they're you

1549
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,400
know a startup they can go and they can

1550
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,660
be integrated with because we will

1551
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,480
standardize that and right now there's

1552
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,299
it's it's a big challenge in the in the

1553
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:14,160
industry of how to integrate with all of

1554
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,559
the human resources uh data sources that

1555
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,480
are out there

1556
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,299
uh Delta query already mentioned

1557
01:07:21,299 --> 01:07:24,780
won't uh go into that

1558
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,160
uh

1559
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,099
there's uh we've previously discussed uh

1560
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:31,380
and who knows one will actually you know

1561
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,059
pick up the pen

1562
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:35,099
um some sort of security best current

1563
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:37,619
practices document

1564
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:40,980
um and this is essentially just to uh in

1565
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:44,339
lieu of uh modifying these right now

1566
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:48,180
directly in the skim uh you know I guess

1567
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,640
uh schema or protocol rfes because you

1568
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,740
know when we crack those open it's a bit

1569
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,660
of a mess when it gets to uh do we

1570
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,280
increase the

1571
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,160
uh the version of scam to like 2.0.1 or

1572
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,559
2.1 or whichever uh for now we just want

1573
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:05,339
to look at writing a BCP to advise uh on

1574
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:07,559
things like uh dropping user password

1575
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:10,200
authentication uh not using the password

1576
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,079
attribute in like non-legacy or you know

1577
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:15,480
any like internet facing or like SAS

1578
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,520
scenarios uh just to give folks a uh a

1579
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,679
nudge towards uh aligning with more

1580
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:25,679
modern security practices

1581
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,479
um and then we could sort of call the

1582
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,520
the last one the reference attribute URL

1583
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,738
authorization the uh the photo problem

1584
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:37,738
um so at least across uh Internet

1585
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,799
connected uh it's like skim service

1586
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:43,920
writers or uh you know clients uh

1587
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,960
implementation and thinking of like the

1588
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,580
profile pictures for instance with the

1589
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:50,460
photos attribute is a really really low

1590
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,080
adoption rate

1591
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,640
um and my take on why that is is that

1592
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,000
the uh so the skim spec defines

1593
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,160
reference URLs and this is not to be

1594
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,080
confused with the referential values

1595
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,859
draft earlier uh but a reference URL or

1596
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:09,660
your URI

1597
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,219
um so

1598
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:13,259
uh essentially you can say this user's

1599
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:15,500
profile picture is at you know HTTP

1600
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,020
colon whack whack whatever the URL is uh

1601
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,779
nothing in this game spec talks about uh

1602
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:24,719
authorization for those urls so in

1603
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,540
Internet connected systems if uh you

1604
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,460
know your your Cloud IDP is trying to

1605
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,198
think to a SAS app and provide pictures

1606
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:33,179
you can provide the URLs but there's no

1607
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:35,880
way standardize to say and here's the

1608
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,799
token or whichever that you use to go

1609
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:40,319
access these URLs and get these pictures

1610
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,279
uh and that is a problem that uh I would

1611
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,640
like to solve

1612
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,299
uh there's a couple of comments in the

1613
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:53,939
chat I think Daryl are you here in the

1614
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,560
room do you want to

1615
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,420
do you want to repeat that in for the

1616
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,900
room or

1617
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,600
we can read it to you

1618
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,880
[Laughter]

1619
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,580
uh the the comment was about the Delta

1620
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:15,239
token mechanism uh being expensive yeah

1621
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:17,340
so you mentioned about using like a

1622
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,020
watermark token

1623
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,320
um and it is a effective way of doing it

1624
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,760
that can provide High Fidelity Delta uh

1625
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,500
the challenge is you're putting a burden

1626
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,360
on the server to keep track of all of

1627
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,280
those Delta tokens and it can get

1628
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,219
expensive for servers so it would be

1629
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:37,739
worth having uh potentially multiple

1630
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:39,900
where one is just the last modified type

1631
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,020
thing uh for scenarios where the data is

1632
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,300
not as volatile uh or it's not as

1633
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,640
critical that if a data is is dropped

1634
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,239
with a it's a lower bar to entry

1635
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:55,679
uh yeah thanks girl that makes sense so

1636
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,920
um as part the the

1637
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,100
overarching like use case that I am

1638
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,980
trying to address with uh at least start

1639
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,420
with with the like the the Delta query

1640
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,880
topic uh is around actually we'll call

1641
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,860
it the High Fidelity things uh we'll you

1642
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,260
know go back to the use case of uh like

1643
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,140
the human resources based provisioning

1644
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,159
where

1645
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:19,920
um you really want to catch you know

1646
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,659
every result

1647
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:23,880
um and I think uh you are correct though

1648
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,440
that we need to have multiple options

1649
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,239
both from a like a cost to implement

1650
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,460
side and I guess a Fidelity side

1651
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,840
although you know if it was the same

1652
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,340
cost to implement why not use the higher

1653
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,020
Fidelity but

1654
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:34,679
um

1655
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:36,060
uh

1656
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,400
yeah I think most of the human resources

1657
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,980
providers you know to you know keep on

1658
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,380
that use case uh already have some form

1659
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,780
of a Delta you know like a watermark

1660
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,060
based token system so it's not a stretch

1661
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,820
for them at least uh but we I I yes we

1662
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,800
we should also outline uh doing things

1663
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,560
like you know meta.lastmodified uh which

1664
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,840
are already like sort of you know

1665
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,400
they're they're they're there but not

1666
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,159
explicitly uh or maybe there is an

1667
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,900
explicit example in uh one of the

1668
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,380
current specs but yeah

1669
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:10,280
um I agree

1670
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:13,500
and then if I uh if I can go back to

1671
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,340
your slide comparing these these three

1672
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,340
um

1673
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,580
can you uh make sure that the

1674
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,739
in the in the like the the pagination

1675
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:28,320
draft that the use cases for why that is

1676
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,500
relevant is captured in the intro to

1677
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,760
that that's usually a good place to like

1678
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,500
accept the context

1679
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,940
for the draft

1680
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,800
um because it does like what I'm hearing

1681
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,440
hear from you and uh

1682
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,780
from others in the room but I know it's

1683
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,159
been part of the discussions elsewhere

1684
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,280
is that there is some concern about

1685
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,440
overlapping use cases being solved by

1686
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,880
multiple drafts

1687
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,640
so we want to make sure that if

1688
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,340
uh that the use cases for each one are

1689
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,380
clear so that you know someone reading

1690
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,900
this knows if I have this problem then

1691
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,420
I'm going to go follow these the set of

1692
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,100
instructions

1693
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,880
and hopefully they're not thinking that

1694
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,760
they have to do everything for every use

1695
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,800
case because I think that is the problem

1696
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,620
that people are are concerned about so

1697
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,960
just you know clarifying which

1698
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,699
what is the actual problem being solved

1699
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:23,460
before we get into the the mechanism in

1700
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,500
the drafts

1701
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,820
uh

1702
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,739
okay yeah your uh I've heard your

1703
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,980
feedback

1704
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,820
and yeah in the chat Dean chimed in just

1705
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:42,300
to say uh that uh

1706
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,280
essentially he agreed with Daryl uh

1707
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,659
client and server need to maintain stake

1708
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:48,120
we use larger green timestamp instead uh

1709
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:51,540
which I think it really boils down to uh

1710
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,940
is it sort of a push versus a pull thing

1711
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,920
if you're looking to see what's changed

1712
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,560
in uh and maybe I'm not classifying it

1713
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,820
right but

1714
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,560
um

1715
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,140
it I I think no maybe I am I don't know

1716
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,760
uh I don't want to speak for you Dean I

1717
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,380
don't know if you have any

1718
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,800
uh wider or you know more clear opinions

1719
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,100
on that

1720
01:14:13,219 --> 01:14:17,179
Dina are you in the room yeah

1721
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,900
uh Dean sacks from Amazon uh Danny what

1722
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,360
I was suggesting is that we generally

1723
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,219
don't need

1724
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:26,820
um

1725
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,920
I can't say this always but in many

1726
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,719
cases we don't need such fine-grained

1727
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,540
specificity that uh that uh uh time

1728
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:36,120
drift is going to be problematic

1729
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,980
um I can't say that in all cases I think

1730
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,239
if there are cases where that's a

1731
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:40,500
problem then maybe you use the watermark

1732
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,020
based method uh but time stamps may be

1733
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,600
appropriate for many implementations and

1734
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,760
so that gets back to your point of uh

1735
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,560
multiple different mechanisms for doing

1736
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,840
Delta queries not just settling on the

1737
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,820
single one

1738
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:54,960
yep

1739
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,699
and thank you

1740
01:14:56,699 --> 01:15:01,159
hi I'm jolly and you're in the queue

1741
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,360
hi Danny uh this is Anjali from AWS I

1742
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,000
have a question regarding your HR schema

1743
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,400
extension

1744
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,020
uh can you a little bit explain like

1745
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:18,600
what's the use case of why we want to do

1746
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,540
like an important role would it be more

1747
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,780
of an extension of a role uh that a user

1748
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,600
may have in the HR System

1749
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,120
are

1750
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,659
yeah

1751
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,340
it's very good

1752
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,239
uh okay so uh the the use case there is

1753
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:42,239
uh

1754
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,860
more and more uh sort of identity

1755
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,980
system designs have started to shift in

1756
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,360
you know let's say the past five years

1757
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,020
or so where uh human resources

1758
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:59,400
uh is deemed the like the the true

1759
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,940
source of Authority for the state of

1760
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,520
most of your user data uh so whether

1761
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,580
it's first name last name uh you know

1762
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,300
what city they live in their office

1763
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,500
uh you know anything of that sort are

1764
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,900
you know are they employed or terminated

1765
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,760
uh is

1766
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,719
sort of uh the primary location for that

1767
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:25,380
is human resources and it in turn uh

1768
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,420
flows down to other things identity

1769
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,340
providers uh Learning Management Systems

1770
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,179
any other connected uh places

1771
01:16:32,179 --> 01:16:36,260
and a big challenge that exists when

1772
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,440
trying to move that HR data into other

1773
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,219
systems uh is that right now the human

1774
01:16:44,219 --> 01:16:46,920
resources providers all have generally

1775
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,620
like disparate and

1776
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,380
uh and proprietary schemas

1777
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:55,199
and so there's not a scale mechanism

1778
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,719
yeah Danny I was just going to add

1779
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:01,199
um to anjali's question it was more to

1780
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,140
get better Affinity as Danny is saying

1781
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:07,440
that the HR database is broader than

1782
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,140
just the role and the need to have that

1783
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,659
stronger mapping and Affinity so the

1784
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:14,460
examples were for instance adding

1785
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,500
pronouns he she

1786
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,140
they sorry right

1787
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,520
um as well as some other potential

1788
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,940
fields

1789
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:27,080
can you stick with the mic there

1790
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,540
yeah and that could be the extension of

1791
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,640
a role itself like a specialized role

1792
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,500
which says okay this is a worker or an

1793
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,659
employee and a user is taking a role of

1794
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:41,820
work so for that I would

1795
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,040
volunteer you to work with Danny on that

1796
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,380
that was just recognition that we needed

1797
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,840
to extend the skim schema to allow okay

1798
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,420
for those fields to be recognized sure

1799
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,140
yeah thank you

1800
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:57,480
which I I would uh

1801
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,020
say that the at least the mod like the

1802
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,840
angle that uh I've been looking to

1803
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,800
approach this from uh has been to

1804
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,260
represent the human resources data

1805
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,420
in such a way that whatever the system

1806
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,280
is that's consuming it

1807
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,980
can you know connect to multiple Human

1808
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,199
Resources systems uh essentially you

1809
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,880
know build once connect to many uh

1810
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,980
utilize an open standard uh and then

1811
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,659
that system whether you know it's an

1812
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:27,060
identity provider or whichever can make

1813
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:30,000
its own decisions about what to do

1814
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,940
uh so things like you know uh the you

1815
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,880
know this value in Human Resources means

1816
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,520
this user has this role uh well like if

1817
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,840
we're talking about the the role

1818
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,600
attribute on the user resource in skim

1819
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,060
uh at the end of the day that should be

1820
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,940
up to essentially look at the HR data

1821
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,739
and then your own logic

1822
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:51,360
in whatever your app that's consuming

1823
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,980
the HR data that leads you to decide

1824
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,500
what to do with that data you know

1825
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,820
different systems care about different

1826
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:01,159
attribute values some don't care at all

1827
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,340
but uh yeah this is the last slide this

1828
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,940
is uh that's truly now I think this is

1829
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,679
all I've all I've got the first time was

1830
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,380
a false no this is great this is work to

1831
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:18,140
come so yep we look forward to that

1832
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:21,360
so I think that was it on the agenda so

1833
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,440
I could do a call for any other business

1834
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,840
topics of discussion

1835
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,120
going once

1836
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,880
going twice

1837
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,840
all right so we may give you uh

1838
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,760
okay I can't do the math 41 minutes back

1839
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,640
um so there are a couple of drafts out

1840
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,380
there there's one for a call for

1841
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,560
adoption so I encourage all of you to

1842
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,440
read and provide comments so that we can

1843
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,420
progress the work

1844
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:57,060
that we've started to do

1845
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,640
and I would also like to ask for more

1846
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,320
comments on the

1847
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,659
um the options that Annie laid out about

1848
01:20:03,659 --> 01:20:07,020
the uses for events versus

1849
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,739
pagination for sinking I'm just

1850
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,840
if you have any experience with

1851
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,140
deploying these the experience is very

1852
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:18,780
welcome as comments so we can make sure

1853
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,800
that

1854
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,760
we're doing the right thing

1855
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:28,500
hey I think with that we can conclude

1856
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,480
thank you everyone for participating

1857
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,520

1858
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,520

1859
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,840

1860
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,480

1861

1863
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,199

1864
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:53,280
be like this and we can use that time to

1865
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,860

1866
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,719
