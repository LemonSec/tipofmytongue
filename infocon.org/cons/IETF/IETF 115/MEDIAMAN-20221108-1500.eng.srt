1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,860
foreign

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,000
oh that's fun

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,180
nothing else

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,380
correctly in the um

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,180
is there correctly

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,279
okay

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,960
so I suspect that someone's been writing

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,040
sedate notes into the media man

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,899
so this looks as if someone's been

10
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,860
writing sedate notes and into medium and

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,860
foreign

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,100
because the link had media man in it

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,539
wow

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,300
whoever takes not should just leave them

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,100
there in case you know so they don't get

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,940
lost

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,079
yeah

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,399
that's kind of annoying

19
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,860
because

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,060
so so you can start off by writing a

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,040
header header across it if you're

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,659
looking for the sedate not see the

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,439
bottom of this page

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,798
uh

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,540
what's up

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,619
note note that the meeting started one

27
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,220
minute ago

28
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,700
okay

29
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,080
foreign

30
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,019
I think I think that's actually a

31
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,239
template the notes that are currently

32
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,660
sitting on our note URL

33
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,060
something is strange

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,900
that's for sure

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,160
thank you

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,739
uh

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,519
yes

38
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,860
it's fine I should be doing it

39
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,760
foreign

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,099
so if you were just looking for a quiet

41
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,860
place to

42
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,799
to read your mail

43
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,319
this might be the room for you but if

44
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,420
you're here for the media man work group

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,780
welcome

46
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,358
so we have one hour

47
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,220
and we have

48
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,019
a couple of slides to go through

49
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,580
sorry

50
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,479

51
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,639
so standard stuff

node well is the same as always

53
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,520
if you have if you can't read the small

54
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,520
print just look at the online Pages it's

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,919
the same as in every working group

56
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,100
meeting tips same thing

57
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,500
wear masks unless actively speaking at

58
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,100
the microphone

59
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,960

our stuff comes in

63
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,720
so

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,620
first point

65
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,540
this is Media man working group

66
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,180
second point do I have a volunteer for

67
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,600
scribe

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,740
Graham can I irritate you

69
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,619
subscribing

70
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,979
what's going on at the moment

71
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,460
oh yeah

72
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,419
Alexa and Graham will cooperate on

73
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,520
sliding on

74
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,500
taking notes

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,160
somehow

76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
we have three drafts and one discussion

77
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,720
item to go through

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,820
the top level

79
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,100
the haptics

80
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,740
the multiple suffixes

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,020
and the discussion on registration

82
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,000
procedures

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
and all that is going to take less than

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,360
one hour

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,240
and now does anyone wish to bash the

86
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,720
agenda

87
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,318
it's on the screen

88
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,680
and in the slides in the online deck

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,639
slides

90
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,198
I'm sorry

91
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,740
so I think I also sent the agenda and

92
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,919
text and make lists but uh

93
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,479
I might have changed it after that

94
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,440
without telling anyone

95
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
so nobody wishes to bash the agenda so

96
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,800
we'll just go out

97
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,319
so

98
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,280
for each draft on my list I have three

99
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,940
standards questions standard questions

100
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,100
one is who has read the drafts

101
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,259
one second is who supports going to the

102
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,800
working group last call at this time

103
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,020
and who thinks there are issues that

104
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,940
should be there called result before the

105
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,280
working group last calls

106
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,259
if you raise your hand for both of those

107
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,199
class two then uh

108
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,740
I think you're somewhat confused

109
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,860
so those are kind of exclusive the point

110
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,740
of this is

111
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,680
exercise is to flush out issues now

112
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,740
so that we don't so that we actually get

113
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,520
forward progress

114
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,180
I'd like this working group to finish

115
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,199
preferably soon

116
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,360
so

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,639
Martin couldn't be here

118
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,860
either online or not so

119
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,479
I'll

120
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,539
speak to that

121
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,060
changes since last idea

122
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,300
we now have a working group

123
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,979
repo a working group git organization

124
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,220
and it has a

125
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,560
report git repository that contains the

126
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
medium and top level drafts

127
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,979
there's a zero one person per version

128
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,440
published there's a few issues raised

129
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,860
against this

130
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,620
and

131
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,880
that's actually

132
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,000
all the status there is this is an edge

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,500
slide so

134
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,040
the issues that are on my list are

135
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,740
criteria for registration

136
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,339
there's a proposal in the drafts which

137
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,140
people might consider appropriate or not

138
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,000
it's uh

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,040
we need to describe what the effect of

140
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
having a top level type is supposed to

141
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
be

142
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,399
it would be nice if it actually fits yet

143
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,440
had somebody assembleness the reality

144
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,940
if you strive for World Peace by

145
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,620
reducing top level types you're in the

146
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,220
wrong business

147
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,320
should we have a

148
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,060
Ayan registry of the top level types

149
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,339
where should we put background

150
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,640
justification info that this

151
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
is done by

152
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,019
leveler

153
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,320
by the top level types and

154
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
I forget because this question was

155
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,019
should we use should

156
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,420
I was curious about the last one and I

157
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,920
actually had a quick look I think Martin

158
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,260
said is like should we use should more

159
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,480
than must in in various places it's not

160
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,080
very specific yeah so that's uh

161
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,920
kind of

162
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,940
I can't find my repo at the moment

163
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,420
GitHub there it is

164
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,019
top level

165
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,920
issues

166
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,160
so Martin's uh

167
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,459
comments are that yes it uses nests like

168
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,040
it should this must be done in order to

169
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
register a neural type

170
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,420
and that's kind of a subset of the

171
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,519
criteria discussion

172
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,920
where and

173
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,839
yeah

174
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,459
so

175
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,680
all right all right I have a new issue

176
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,120
to raise and I can comment on the should

177
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,959
thing

178
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,600
um you don't have to use

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,700
the should type language just in order

180
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,200
to be normative you can say this is

181
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,420
simply the way it is done

182
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,920
um so it's up to you how you do it but

183
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,420
don't feel like that's the only way to

184
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,740
get people to

185
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,860
comport with whatever you want to say

186
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,420
um and the other thing is that all three

187
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,620
of the documents I just went through

188
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,540
them very quickly looking for a few

189
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,160
things that I typically trip on when I'm

190
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,320
looking at things that get to the isg

191
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,079
none of them use BCP 14 properly so the

192
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,959
authors will need to fix that

193
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,360
14 is uh the should the keywords thing

194
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,480
so it's it's a they all refer to 2119

195
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,100
and one of them makes up some of its own

196
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,820
stuff can't do that so yeah

197
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,920
so that's uh

198
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,300
that's an issue there is

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,560
so I'll ask here some quick questions

200
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,920
criteria for registration or first first

201
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,839
question who has read the drafts

202
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,980
five out of seven or something like that

203
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm not

204
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,839
yeah and

205
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,839
um

206
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,880
creative organization

207
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,980
and

208
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,899
who thinks the current criteria are

209
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,720
approximately right

210
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,500
I think so

211
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
approximately

212
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,860
so you know they don't think it's

213
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,360
obviously

214
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,240
I mean Martin does not often the right

215
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
field is more or less where we want to

216
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,399
be but of course there's always details

217
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,459
the effects I think that's wordsmithing

218
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,260
and

219
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,620
Alexey Alexi yeah I wish the criteria

220
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,600
was very crisp about you know you just

221
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,100
know and go through checklists and just

222
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,139
decide but it's it's not and I think

223
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,880
that's just real world with this sort of

224
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,779
thing

225
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,000
uh we need to find out is there is

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,620
enough interest or is documenting

227
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,620
existing use and you know all of these

228
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,300
things so

229
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,820
yeah I think yeah so basically I'm

230
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,320
saying you know yeah I wish it was

231
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,060
better but it's the way it is and that's

232
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,399
probably good enough yeah

233
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,920
so we'll we'll take suggestions for

234
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,120
making it better

235
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,220
but I think we'll do that in the list

236
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,959
do we think there should be an Ayana

237
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,339
registry of top level types

238
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,639
yes

239
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:57,060
yes no

240
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,360
and care to elaborate

241
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,100
the no has to elaborate I think

242
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
okay I'm not quite sure what problem is

243
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,139
being solved here but I'm hesitant to

244
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,180
say too much because I haven't I'm not

245
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,000
up to speed with the draft but it seems

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,220
that top level types are sufficiently

247
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,500
rare that the overhead of having to

248
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,660
write a new RFC to create one doesn't

249
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,660
seem to be that out of out of line

250
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,420
oh well I'm thinking that comes comes on

251
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,380
the criteria I I think in nrfc is

252
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,260
perfectly perfectly appropriate but uh

253
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,300
keeping a list of them might be a good

254
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,540
thing so uh Alexa yeah Murray was

255
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,420
actually the following protocol so you

256
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,180
should go first yeah

257
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,260
um

258
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,420
being media type reviewer actually one

259
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,820
of the things that trips me several

260
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,320
times is

261
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,660
quite unless you know where to look it's

262
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,120
kind of hard to know where the model of

263
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,820
media type is registered because it's

264
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,839
very old RFC it doesn't fall the new

265
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,120
template uh

266
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,220
and there are a few things like this so

267
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,380
yes maybe it can be just dealt with by

268
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,660
edging references to RFC numbers on the

269
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,040
media type page and that might be

270
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,240
sufficient

271
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,279
uh

272
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,399
but I kind of think that it might be

273
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,040
easier to just have a registry and

274
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,420
registration procedures are actually

275
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,480
required which is whatever which is

276
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,060
already what we what we're doing anyway

277
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,820
okay you convinced me I would draw my no

278
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,300
thank you I think we have

279
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,459
a con content

280
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,500
and working group get in the room

281
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,139
consensus on uh one thing I mean an

282
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,820
Ayana registry

283
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,560
and where to put background

284
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,320
justification info I kind of think that

285
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,180
that might be moved if we keep the

286
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,360
requirement for having an RFC published

287
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,320
because that's the place they put it

288
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
with the haptics with the haptics being

289
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
a good

290
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,300
good example to follow

291
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,959
and

292
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,339
the way I read the should be used should

293
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,060
is really should be relaxed requirements

294
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,680
so that they're a little bit more sloppy

295
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,019
and I was hearing the opposite from this

296
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,079
Murray I'm going back one point to the

297
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,399
background information if we're going to

298
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,399
do RFC required which I think would be

299
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,320
hard to justify do anything less than

300
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,339
that

301
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,660
um it seems like

302
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,399
that's going to take care of the second

303
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,920
last bullet

304
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,940
yep

305
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,000
so let the notes show that we seem to be

306
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,399
thinking that the answer is in the RFC

307
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,459
and then

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,759
I heard some comment on

309
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,940
on saying that we should

310
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,019
make sure the

311
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,099
the requirements are as crisp as

312
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,959
possible which says that we shouldn't

313
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,380
you should

314
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,359
but I think that comes down to a

315
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,540
discussion of each individual Criterion

316
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,500
foreign

317
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,459
so

318
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,020
my

319
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,919
current understanding is that

320
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,860
this needs to be revised again

321
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,360
it's not ready for last call

322
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,679
and we should say thank you very much

323
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,460
for to Martin

324
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:43,440
and get get get kicking with commenting

325
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,220
on the issues

326
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,720
we'll go to the next slide

327
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,240
and that's what's supposed to be a says

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,900
separate presentation and you and Mr

329
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,590
mutasami is asking to

330
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,660
[Music]

331
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,520
presents

332
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,320
hi Harold hi everyone

333
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,100
[Music]

334
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,260
I think I may have to stop stop

335
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,260
presenting in stop stress here and

336
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,520
ground screen and see if that works okay

337
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,620
you might have you it's possible that

338
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,120
you have it

339
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,500
yes I do

340
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,240
it takes a little while to start up

341
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,340
okay let me see

342
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,100
are you able to share my I see my screen

343
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,200
or do I have to do something

344
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,179
you have to share

345
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,640
okay I thought I was doing that give me

346
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,000
a second

347
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,559
I mean mythical seems to be thinking

348
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,539
that you're not sharing

349
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,660
ah here we go I was looking for the

350
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,340
shared window as opposed to the entire

351
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,020
screen I found it

352
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,419
okay

353
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,120
now I'm gonna go into slideshow mode and

354
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,799
ask the question again are you able to

355
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,240
see my screen now

356
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,700
yes okay great

357
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,760
hi everyone my name is yashwant mutasami

358
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,500
and I'm going to give a quick update on

359
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,220
the Optics internet draft

360
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,679
uh just a quick rundown of what has

361
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,900
happened since the last time I I

362
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,000
uploaded a version of the draft which is

363
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,200
version zero one in back in May uh the

364
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,720
in there have been a lot of haptics

365
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,200
related development in a MPEG which are

366
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,480
quite quite relevant to what is

367
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,480
happening here uh the impact guy haptics

368
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,919
phase one

369
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,640
codec is now in CD back

370
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,780
palette which is a first of three rounds

371
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,820
the there is a new working draft on the

372
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,080
MPEG eye

373
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,740
Carriage of haptics data and this is

374
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,620
significant because it uses or

375
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,240
defines and fleshes out the mih1 haptic

376
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,200
subtype to refer to the Enterprise optic

377
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,919
streams and in the emperor guy scene

378
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,380
description group two haptics extensions

379
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,000
have been approved for implementation

380
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,840
and there is a new working graph that's

381
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,600
specifies how haptics

382
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,960
interplays with interactivity and user

383
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,080
representations and so on and I have

384
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,500
done a scrub of Martin's draft and to

385
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,440
see whether the haptics IV satisfies all

386
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
the all the requirements as listed in

387
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
the two sections and the next few slides

388
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,820
are going to be effectively kind of a q

389
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,220
a on whether those requirements are

390
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,320
being satisfied or not

391
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,140
so let's jump right into it the first

392
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,900
one uh I'm not going to read through all

393
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
of his

394
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,360
his criteria you you have that with you

395
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,059
just the blue Parts which are my answers

396
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,760
to whether they are they are being

397
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,059
satisfied or not they intended

398
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,340
status of this draft is indeed as

399
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,020
standards track RFC and I have received

400
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,700
evidence of interest from three

401
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,940
organizations so far you've you might

402
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,900
have seen the emails to the media types

403
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,539
mailing list they are from

404
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:34,880
tencent

405
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,520
interdigital and Razer the interdigital

406
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,679
is kind of hot off the presses I just

407
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,380
forward it to the group just now I

408
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,179
wasn't sure if it's going to show up by

409
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,580
itself uh

410
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,820
I I don't think that there is any

411
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,940
confusion here because all subtypes that

412
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,659
pertain to any formats pertaining to

413
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,640
haptics or any of the sub

414
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,980
moralities of haptics would fall under

415
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,980
this top level type so in my opinion at

416
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,740
least there is zero scope for

417
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,179
confusion

418
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,200
moving on uh the I have two actual

419
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
subtypes

420
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,460
defined in this draft as soon as this

421
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,640
draft is approved

422
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,380
the registration of the actual types

423
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,600
will be done and reflected on the final

424
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
RFC document but there are also a number

425
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,080
of subtypes which I talk about in this

426
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,380
in this deck and we can go about we can

427
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,919
look at that and these are the haptics

428
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,700
subtypes which are actually in use as we

429
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,200
speak a a hap is

430
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,659
is a format that represents all of the

431
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,380
encoding used in iOS devices right now

432
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,059
you know over a billion mobile devices

433
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,860
worldwide or org is a proprietary

434
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,140
extension to the org for for format for

435
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,880
haptics done by Google by Google and uh

436
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,740
and IBS is a he

437
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,960
invent a specific haptic for format that

438
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,080
we at immersion are using and many of

439
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
our our customers are using same goes

440
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,620
for hacked in a decision to this there

441
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,440
are a number of Standards

442
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,320
related haptic for subtypes which are in

443
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,940
Flight in various stages of

444
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,720
standardization and a few of them are

445
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,200
documented in section 2.6 but based on

446
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
the last meeting in the month of October

447
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,419
at MPEG there are a few more which are

448
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,059
worth mentioning and you see them all

449
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,120
here the HM Peg is the phase one coding

450
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,460
format H Jeff is The Interchange format

451
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,220
mih1 as I mentioned already is a

452
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,360
streaming format and then the highee

453
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,880
according for formats are actually

454
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,419
invalid this is the idea in the final

455
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,659
IEEE essay that the ballot and they have

456
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,059
one vibro tactile and two kinesthetic

457
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,960
coding for formats and the he enum and

458
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,600
the havc are the are the in enumerated

459
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,539
effects or the A to B or audio to Y

460
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,620
coding formats so there is a lot of

461
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,960
subtypes which are in haptics which are

462
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,720
kind of waiting for the door to be open

463
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,880
so to speak once that

464
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,240
top level haptics type type is approved

465
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,500
these can all be is registered and they

466
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,900
will all live under that tactics the top

467
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,620
level type uh and then of course as I

468
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,840
mentioned already hey immersion has

469
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,900
testified two success to two subtypes

470
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,940
and we have

471
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,299
control over and in the email from from

472
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,220
from

473
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,900
laser they have indicated strong

474
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,720
interest in to in having two of their

475
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,840
own subtypes be under the haptics it's a

476
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,780
top level type the apps and the chaps

477
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,900
and I think the email from Razer

478
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,620
actually provides an a Exemplar as a

479
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,860
subtype

480
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,960
registration I will let you read through

481
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,940
that email it's on the list

482
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,460
and as I mentioned they're MPEG subtypes

483
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,919
are there which are in the previous

484
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,659
slide these will become part of the

485
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,000
impact standard over the course of the

486
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,440
next 12 to 18 months and the IEEE

487
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,120
subtypes are going to be used in the 5G

488
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,380
tactile internet application space uh a

489
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,799
quick rundown to the section 2.2 there

490
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,559
is no there

491
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,000
are no undefined top level types

492
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,299
currently in news of course it is it is

493
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,220
actively being discussed in this working

494
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,059
group right now so no issues there uh

495
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,260
all data for formats or subtypes under

496
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,659
the Optics ID they all put into the

497
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,580
sense of touch and they need to be under

498
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,440
the proposed top level type and the key

499
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,860
common feature of all of these uh

500
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,200
subtypes is that they all require some

501
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
kind of a haptic subsystems such as low

502
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,880
level haptics apis which in turn will

503
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,400
require Hardware capabilities such as

504
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,400
one or more haptic actuators to actually

505
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,340
do the rendering of the haptic haptic

506
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,419
media so they do all share these common

507
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:41,039
features and attributes uh and the and

508
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,779
the last one is that that these are all

509
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:47,640
pertaining to the sense of touch in much

510
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,159
the same way that audio and video top

511
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,380
level types pertain to the sense of

512
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,460
hearing and with vision uh and then

513
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,539
common restrictions yeah the applied

514
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,600
this is what I could think of and I

515
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,779
didn't quite understand the ask in this

516
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,880
last criteria this might be something

517
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,059
that we discussed on the list it seemed

518
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,400
to be kind of more of stream of

519
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,580
Consciousness and wasn't as crisp as as

520
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,940
someone already had a

521
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,880
comment and I kind of felt this one was

522
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,220
something that could do with a little

523
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,860
bit of fine tuning but in terms of what

524
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,480
I could get

525
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,559
gather from this last criteria my

526
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,659
response is that files which contain

527
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,820
just haptics without any audio and video

528
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,799
will be directed to the appropriate

529
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,100
haptic output output device and an

530
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,500
example would be a haptic chair such as

531
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,580
a one from d-box or bodysuits which are

532
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,700
expecting tactics on only files and

533
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,380
that's pretty much it

534
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,279
any questions

535
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,820
uh hi um this is much further along than

536
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,320
the last time I looked at it so thanks

537
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,220
for that

538
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,720
um you're running a checklist against

539
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,700
the top level document that's great I

540
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,779
was going to make sure wanted to make

541
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,700
sure you're doing that um

542
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,700
section

543
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,120
one one uh is obsolete you need to look

544
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,760
at 81.74 that's the new text that you

545
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,980
need to use in that section

546
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,220
um okay

547
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,980
sorry are you now referring to specific

548
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,640
sections in my draft yes okay okay I

549
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,380
just want to make sure that the

550
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,659
references were from okay

551
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:40,640
um

552
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,620
one thing that uh your two registrations

553
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,059
in four three

554
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,460
uh two correct two short corrections as

555
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,260
I I see this a lot when I'm looking at

556
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,360
media type registrations

557
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,279
um you have required parameters none it

558
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,720
has to be n a

559
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,400
otherwise none is interpreted as there's

560
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,080
a parameter called none that you need to

561
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,140
describe

562
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,580
they also the templates both of them are

563
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,320
missing security considerations there

564
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,820
needs to be a reference to something to

565
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,779
look at

566
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,580
um okay which which brings me to your

567
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,199
section three I think

568
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,039
um is this other security considerations

569
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,659
you got four paragraphs here so thank

570
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,520
you for being thorough

571
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,679
um do those cover all haptics types or

572
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,140
just the two-year registering no they

573
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,720
cover all haptics types okay I think

574
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,880
that should be made crisp because

575
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,860
um this is going to be the document that

576
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,840
I as a media type reviewer come to look

577
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,220
for should I allow this haptics

578
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,080
registration this is all the guidance

579
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,159
I'm going to come to so I need to know

580
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:37,440
if this stuff applies to that these two

581
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,240
haptics things or to all future haptics

582
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,620
things so just make that clear please

583
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:47,059
okay okay okay great feedback thank you

584
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,520
so

585
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,419
thank you and speaking as participants

586
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,600
for a moment

587
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,220
I believe that the

588
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,520
the last slide was uh

589
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,419
mostly a text that was and was not uh

590
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,940
responsive to the

591
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,720
to the text from the top level draft but

592
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,480
I also believe that most of the texts

593
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,580
can be replaced with not applicable

594
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,820
so that's uh should be an easy edit

595
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,020
that'll uh send I'll file issues by the

596
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,279
way

597
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,320
do you have a repository that you want

598
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,419
to move or do you want to keep editing

599
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,600
yourself

600
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,539
are you asking me yes

601
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,120
uh do you want to have a repository on

602
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,679
the under the working group for the for

603
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,020
the drop for the drafts where you can we

604
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,080
can file issues and so on sure yes that

605
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,000
would be great

606
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,679
we'll set that up

607
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,980
okay and so

608
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,620
my impression of this draft is that uh

609
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,140
yes we

610
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,659
seem to be supportive of getting the

611
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,179
haptics top level type registers

612
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,980
but there are some issues with a draft

613
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,620
that need to be addressed and

614
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,039
we should

615
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,620
pursue this further yeah that'll

616
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,760
yes

617
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,120
um this may be my ignorance in 431 you

618
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,399
have encoding considerations that says

619
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,980
Tech slash binary is that meaning

620
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,899
sometimes it will be text sometimes it

621
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,299
will be binary

622
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,620
uh I have to look at what you are

623
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,940
referring to it's been a while if you

624
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,520
can give me just a minute here like and

625
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,039
pull it up uh okay to just to uh answer

626
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,520
your question there could be some

627
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,760
haptics files like the descriptive

628
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
formats like ahap which has basically an

629
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,279
extension of the Json standard so that I

630
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,380
think is what is being referred to that

631
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,600
that would be the text part where they

632
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,120
provide a specification of the haptic

633
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,039
effect in Json format in other cases the

634
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,960
haptic file is just a binary signal

635
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,140
thank you

636
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,500
so the top level description is to say

637
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,200
that some text type some types might be

638
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,480
text and some text like and some might

639
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,419
be binary yeah each individual

640
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,159
registration needs to specify that Alexa

641
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,799
the encoding consideration and template

642
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,919
is actually is a choice of one of four

643
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,799
Fields four values seven bit Evan bit

644
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,918
8-bit binary or framed so it's actually

645
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,539
the information might be useful but

646
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,580
probably not in this field

647
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,620
I'll have a look

648
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,299
good

649
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,539
at all yeah the particular case is for

650
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:55,140
the IVF subtype so I I get for the

651
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,700
overall top level type it maybe take

652
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,100
survival the IBS I'm presuming that's

653
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,080
one or the other

654
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,940
whatever IVs is

655
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,020
uh IBS is an is an is an XML based

656
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,260
format it has a binary equivalent called

657
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,559
ivt but when you create this file it's

658
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,658
actually in X XML form

659
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,080
okay thank you

660
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,559
okay I think we're at the end of the a

661
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,120
lot of time for this one

662
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,899
and I believe that we have two reasons

663
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,600
why this cannot be last call at this

664
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,519
time the one is that there are some

665
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,440
issues

666
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,779
that needs to be fixed and the other one

667
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,880
is that it depends on the top level

668
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,799
draft that is not fixed not finished but

669
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,440
I think we all very happy to see this go

670
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,419
be substantially closer to

671
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,000
ready than it was last time we looked at

672
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,380
it

673
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,600
thank you don't let that last Point hold

674
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,519
it up by the way we can just make this a

675
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,600
misref

676
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,940
let's find a movement

677
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,099
the thing the thing is that if we change

678
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,260
the Criterion top levels

679
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,000
um

680
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,839
yeah

681
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,899
so let's go back to the

682
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,899
flashlights

683
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,980
[Music]

684
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,240
and see where we are

685
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,580
going out to

686
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,099
suffixes

687
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,040
hi Harold can you hear me

688
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,219
yes I hear you wonderful uh hi my name

689
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,780
is borny

690
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,020
um I'm currently editing the suffixes uh

691
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,460
document

692
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,260
um just just to remind everyone why

693
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,820
we're doing this

694
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,699
um we had a group uh multiple groups at

695
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,280
the World Wide Web Consortium uh namely

696
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,500
the decentralized identifiers working

697
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,180
group and the verifiable credentials

698
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,760
working group that attempted to register

699
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,400
um a media type with multiple structured

700
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,520
suffixes in it and the question was how

701
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,260
exactly should we interpret this there's

702
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,800
no RFC on how we should interpret

703
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,300
um you know media types that have

704
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,099
potentially multiple structured suffixes

705
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,160
so this draft is trying to provide some

706
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,680
guidance on how

707
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,820
um uh implementers should process or how

708
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,520
they can process things with multiple

709
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,040
structured suffixes on them

710
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,640
um so uh since the last meeting we have

711
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,760
transferred the repository over to the

712
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,500
media man working group thank you very

713
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
much Harold for

714
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
picking that up and putting it in there

715
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,680
we have just refreshed the specification

716
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,420
not much has changed since last draft

717
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,180
mainly we're looking for review comments

718
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,680
uh and to make a final uh pass over it

719
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,859
um there are four issues that have been

720
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,720
raised uh Harold would you mind clicking

721
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,640
on that so that we can just bring bring

722
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,440
these up

723
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,740
um let's see I I will have to have to

724
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,060
find some other way to do it because

725
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,119
okay well okay well then I will try and

726
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,800
just read through for those of you that

727
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,839
have access to the slides please feel

728
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,180
free to you know click through to them

729
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,300
um the first issue was uh a request by

730
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,160
Harold to add something to the security

731
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,560
consideration section around you know

732
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,220
how could people abuse

733
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,920
um uh this this new kind of suggestion

734
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
on how you can process uh multiple uh

735
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,579
structured suffixes so uh is there a way

736
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,520
to trick an implementation into doing

737
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,720
something like not doing a virus scan

738
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,660
um when uh doing multiple uh structured

739
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,020
suffix uh processing so the idea here is

740
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,480
that you have a pipeline you feed in a

741
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,240
media type in that pipeline might decide

742
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,980
to not process the entire uh string the

743
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,920
opaque value but it might choose to just

744
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,040
chop the last structured suffix off like

745
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,880
Plus gzip or plus XML or plus LD plus

746
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,300
Json or something like that and process

747
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,900
that according to more General

748
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,940
processing rules and so how could we

749
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,540
trick an implementation

750
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,339
if we are to suggest that that's an okay

751
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,859
way to process these things

752
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,780
um so Harold asked for some language

753
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,900
there we've added it it feels a bit

754
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,660
contrived the current text in the

755
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,480
specification feels a bit contrived but

756
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,820
at least it's there to warn people and

757
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,380
we've been looking for reviewers to

758
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,560
provide a better example so that's uh

759
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,119
issue two

760
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,859
um just keeping that issue open in case

761
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,320
somebody has a better idea of a more

762
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,300
serious attack with this kind of

763
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,619
processing model

764
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,640
uh the issue three uh is adding guidance

765
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,800
around fragment processing so if you

766
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,619
choose to process a document not

767
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,859
according to the entire uh media type

768
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,140
but according to just the structured

769
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,540
suffix uh and the spec

770
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,300
um how should you interpret the fragment

771
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,300
because it will be different in some

772
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,000
cases than the entire thing and is that

773
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,460
valid uh sorry the entire media type and

774
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,260
is that valid uh so we need guidance on

775
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,020
that I would love to hear suggestions

776
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,700
from anyone

777
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,200
um I think what we were thinking of

778
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,320
doing was saying

779
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,579
um it is okay to interpret a fragment

780
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:49,619
according to the specification that's

781
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,619
associated with the structured suffix so

782
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,320
if you've got this big media type and it

783
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,300
ends in

784
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,839
um

785
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,839
I don't know uh uh uh plus let's just

786
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,300
say a plus LD plus Json that's Json LD

787
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,599
thing it isn't okay to interpret the

788
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,359
fragment per the Json LD specification

789
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,920
and not per the more specific media type

790
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,140
uh specification

791
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,480
so thoughts on that would be uh you know

792
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,460
fantastic that's the text that's going

793
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,619
to be written unless we hear a different

794
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,900
idea there

795
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,920
um

796
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,040
next issue was uh review by Mark

797
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,380
Nottingham uh thank you Mark I apologize

798
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,660
for taking so long to get back to your

799
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,920
review

800
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,800
um but uh in the issue I did try and

801
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,980
break down uh the concerns that Mark

802
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,540
raised

803
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,780
um uh many of them you know good good

804
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,900
and fine concerns I think there's

805
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,839
there's a there's a question here uh and

806
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,760
I don't know the answer to this so again

807
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,940
would love to hear uh thoughts on this

808
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,599
um

809
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,339
around

810
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,440
um what happens if you've got a big

811
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
media type

812
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,540
and you use a structured suffix to to

813
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,060
process it in some way

814
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,180
in the way the pipeline algorithm goes

815
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,220
is you can keep lopping off structured

816
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,680
suffixes and processing them according

817
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,260
to the more generalized specification

818
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,260
but at the end of the day sometimes what

819
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,240
you end up with when you Lop those

820
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,119
things off is you end up with a media

821
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,520
type that is not registered anywhere

822
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,980
meaning that it's like what you're left

823
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,060
with is some meta model it has no

824
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,400
serialization

825
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,320
and and what do we do in that case right

826
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,780
so that's the big question uh Mark

827
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,540
Nottingham suggested that maybe what

828
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,460
we're looking at here is a new top level

829
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,880
type feels kind of top level typey

830
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,920
um but that creates a number of other

831
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,980
issues so there's a concern here the the

832
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,200
guidance right now or the guidance I

833
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,520
think that's going to be written into

834
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,099
the specification is

835
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:06,839
if you choose to lob these structured

836
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,420
suffixes off and process them you know

837
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,000
in that order you can keep doing that

838
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,160
until you end up with a media type that

839
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,839
has no registration at that point you

840
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,579
have you don't know what to do you can

841
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,400
process it full stop right

842
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,040
um so I think that's the suggestion

843
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,079
there I have no idea if that's a

844
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,280
terrible idea uh or not it feels I feel

845
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
pretty uncomfortable with that

846
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,960
um but I can't think of a better way to

847
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,480
address that issue and that concern so

848
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,980
there's some text that needs to be

849
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,280
written there based on Mark's review and

850
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,780
then I also need to know from Mark if

851
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,240
he's okay with the other answers in

852
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,599
there and then finally the last issue is

853
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,839
from uh Ted Thibodeaux Jr

854
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,960
um issue number five and he just found a

855
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,280
number of

856
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,740
um grammatical issues that need to be

857
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,760
fixed

858
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,440
um in as some

859
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,300
questions that I think need to be

860
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,640
clarified in the in the spec by just

861
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,339
modifying spec text so

862
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,560
um that's it for the issues if we can go

863
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,260
to the next slide Harold

864
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,359
um

865
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,660
so what we have at this point Who's read

866
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,240
the draft uh new reviewers we had a

867
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,800
bunch of old reviews new reviewers Mark

868
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,099
Nottingham Harold Reddit Roberto pulley

869
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,040
because they're doing a plus yaml uh in

870
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,079
a potentially a plus LD plus yaml

871
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,180
extension

872
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,760
um and then uh Ted Thibodeau new

873
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,560
reviewers they're in the issue tracker

874
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,260
there's some there's probably about two

875
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,880
to three paragraphs that need to be

876
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,700
added to the spec based on that

877
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,480
um

878
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,940
we should not go to last call just yet

879
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,920
because we have things that need to be

880
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,579
added but my hope is by the next ITF we

881
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,500
will be ready to go to last call

882
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,480
um so I think we're going to add those

883
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,760
paragraphs if nobody has any objections

884
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,800
to them uh we're going to ask for

885
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,540
broader review from the did working

886
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,280
group and the verifiable credential

887
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,780
working group

888
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,960
um and get some reviewers from there

889
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,980
um

890
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,619
and then and then that's it so I think

891
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:17,460
that's the plan those are the concerns

892
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,760
um any questions or concerns or

893
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,680
suggestions on how we address some of

894
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,220
these issues

895
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,099
Barrel

896
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,359
hi my name is Daryl Miller

897
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,540
um just it it's probably more of a

898
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,980
question here in

899
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,859
some of the suffix are different than

900
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:45,000
other suffix like plus Json plus XML

901
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,540
is just adding another

902
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,119
lower level layer of semantics but then

903
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,520
things like plus the gzip

904
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,359
are completely changing the stream of

905
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,740
bytes like if you do plus LD Plus gzip

906
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,200
or sorry say let's say do plus Json plus

907
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,020
gzip can I still use a fragment

908
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,200
identifier for Json

909
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,599
or does that is that no longer valid

910
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,460
because of the last

911
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,020
plus Jesus

912
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,760
yeah that's it that's an excellent

913
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,319
question that's where I'm really stuck

914
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:22,079
it's it's those kinds of edge cases that

915
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,480
are just really difficult to write to so

916
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,599
one thing we could say is like uh if you

917
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,000
choose to process multiple structured

918
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,240
suffixes in this way all bets are often

919
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,640
fragment processing right

920
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,760
um uh the other thing that we can say is

921
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,099
um it's it's valid so you know you can

922
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:43,800
you can use a fragment in a plus Json

923
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,980
plus gzip thing U1 gzip it and then if

924
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,780
you want to apply the fragment in the

925
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,780
Json then well I mean I forget what

926
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,640
fragment processing for Jason I don't is

927
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,140
there fragment processing pointer

928
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,839
right okay so if there's fragment

929
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:02,400
processing for Jason pointer and you

930
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,740
have a Jason pointer plus gzip

931
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,260
um if you want to apply you know if you

932
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,180
want to ungzip it and then apply the

933
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,180
fragment processing to the Json pointer

934
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,040
thing it seems like you should be able

935
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,119
to do that

936
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,000
like that seems like a legitimate thing

937
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,940
to do I just don't it's the edge cases I

938
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,500
don't know if that results in some kind

939
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,359
of security compromise on some crazy

940
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,460
combination of the structured suffixes

941
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,200
that's the thing that's really

942
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,599
bothering me right now

943
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,800
um

944
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,160
so we could put the text in there to say

945
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,260
yeah you can process it it's it's your

946
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,240
call you can process it

947
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,339
um uh based on the fragment that's

948
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,339
associated with the structured suffix

949
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:47,160
um do so at your peril right

950
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,319
yeah okay thank you yeah

951
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,560
So speaking as participants

952
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,720
and I kind of think that

953
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,260
gsap is an example of a reversible

954
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,460
information per serving transform

955
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,579
so it makes sense for the G6

956
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,180
suffix registration to say that uh

957
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,180
if you want to interpret the suffix a

958
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,579
fragment identifier on something that

959
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,520
has been has the gzip suffix you need to

960
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,980
unpack it and then apply the fragment

961
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,300
identifier

962
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,880
but I think that we can't make a general

963
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,180
rule for that because

964
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,460
if you transform something from XML to

965
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,520
Json well

966
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,200
that that

967
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,520
probably doesn't have the same fragment

968
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,480
fragment to identify syntax so you would

969
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,880
have to re rewrite the fragments too

970
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,540
so uh I think I think the this this

971
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,079
draft needs to say that uh dealing with

972
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,720
the transformation suffixes under

973
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,520
transformation needs to be specified as

974
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,140
part of this of the

975
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,460
uh transformation descriptions

976
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,640
foreign

977
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,520
field right

978
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,859
which is fine but we will need to

979
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:21,720
retractively review the what we already

980
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,859
registered to make sure

981
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,380
application clarification question uh so

982
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,720
you're saying that we should say in the

983
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,160
spec that

984
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,460
um the how you apply fragment processing

985
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,640
needs to be specified in the document

986
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,859
associated with the structured syntax

987
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,660
suffix

988
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,680
yes okay thank you I'll try to put that

989
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,780
in text on list so it's easier to deal

990
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,220
with there

991
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,300
thanks

992
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,220
okay so we're

993
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,300
so we're now got uh 13 minutes left of

994
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,560
the meeting

995
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,599
and I think that the conclusions are

996
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,480
clear here more work is needed

997
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,540
and but where we seem to be on the right

998
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,700
track and this one does not have a

999
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,460
dependency on any other documents

1000
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,300
so

1001
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,560
we'll ask the

1002
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,760
editors to continue editing and ask all

1003
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,400
the participants to

1004
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,099
make sure that that the comments are

1005
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,140
properly filed so that we so that the

1006
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,640
editors can find them again

1007
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,740
and by the way I forgot who who has read

1008
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,098
the draft

1009
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:40,260
yeah

1010
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,380
half of us that's good

1011
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,540
so

1012
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,640
the last slot was uh

1013
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,400
added because

1014
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,740
Mark nothing had suggested that we

1015
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,319
should have opened up the discussion a

1016
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,140
bit now that we have our first items

1017
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,320
almost out of the way we wish so

1018
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,200
[Music]

1019
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,660
we have in our Charter that we are

1020
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,099
allowed to look at the registration

1021
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,460
procedures overall and

1022
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,240
say something about whether they make

1023
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,700
sense as written whether they need to

1024
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,260
change

1025
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,079
or whether we have a suggestion for a

1026
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:25,920
real

1027
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,680
for for a completely different set of

1028
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,480
procedures

1029
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,760
so I'll open the floor to comments on

1030
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,220
registration procedures

1031
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,299
I see a mark coming

1032
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,339
hello

1033
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:42,300
um

1034
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,220
I think you know

1035
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,920
my motivation for

1036
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,720
putting this in the charter was just the

1037
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,400
observation that

1038
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,000
it seems like a number of folks who

1039
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,240
could register their media types don't

1040
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,060
uh for a variety of reasons and and some

1041
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,260
of that has to do with the friction

1042
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,599
around or uncertainty around the

1043
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,220
registration process

1044
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,200
some of that has to do with what we

1045
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,780
allow them to register I think

1046
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,760
um and so the two kind of conversations

1047
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,660
that I'd like to start are around

1048
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,099
whether we can do things to the

1049
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,819
registration process to

1050
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:22,500
encourage and facilitate more

1051
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,079
registrations and that might be you know

1052
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,599
I I I proposed GitHub

1053
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,720
because we've started using GitHub issue

1054
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,819
cues for a lot of other uh Registries

1055
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:34,800
and especially ones where

1056
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,319
the audience with registry is not just

1057
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:39,540
an ietf audience it's a broader audience

1058
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,280
and I think that's really the case for

1059
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,960
media types

1060
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,760
um and we've been using GitHub issue

1061
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,760
keys with some success in that uh it

1062
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,579
allows you to have one repo where

1063
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,559
there's documentation about you know

1064
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,200
expectations and processing things and

1065
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,180
you can just file an issue and now with

1066
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,460
the newer GitHub issue templates you get

1067
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,319
quite a sophisticated form for Gathering

1068
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,160
data

1069
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,900
and and it was pointed out to me I'd

1070
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,099
forgotten I knew about this but I've

1071
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,780
forgotten that Diana does have a form

1072
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,760
for media types it's one of the places

1073
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,900
where they actually do have some

1074
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,880
infrastructure for letting people do a

1075
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,020
registration

1076
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:17,700
I think the difference is that excuse me

1077
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,640
with with the GitHub you create an issue

1078
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,440
and then you have evidence of that issue

1079
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,480
you can go back and check its status you

1080
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,819
can have a conversation in the issue and

1081
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,260
that's not true with the Forum with the

1082
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,059
form it's it's more fire and forget and

1083
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:32,900
and and I have this

1084
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,559
unfortunately you know this is the

1085
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,000
expense of a lot of registrations is

1086
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,680
that the register follows something

1087
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,540
somewhere or sends an email

1088
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,980
and then they don't really know what the

1089
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,839
status of the request is

1090
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:44,420
um and and or or what the the the

1091
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,339
guarantees on getting a response are it

1092
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:48,780
Ayanna is very good about meeting their

1093
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,200
slas but experts often are not

1094
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,440
and and so uh that's one discussion to

1095
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,420
have I think about what we can do I'm

1096
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,280
happy if we keep the form I think that's

1097
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,200
great I would ask that we think about

1098
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,900
you know whether we have the right

1099
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,920
documentation and words around the form

1100
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,559
to make that process easy and whether we

1101
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,059
can do anything to make the results of

1102
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,599
the form processing more transparent

1103
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:14,460
um or or if people are going to use

1104
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,440
GitHub as uh in all the Registries I've

1105
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,760
used it for it's a parallel process

1106
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,520
people can still file by email and we

1107
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,960
don't want to make people use the

1108
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,280
specific tool

1109
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,619
s

1110
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:27,540
Excuse me yes uh technically yeah you

1111
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,220
need to make a request directly to

1112
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,559
Ayanna you can make a request by email

1113
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:33,900
to The Experts or through some usually

1114
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,520
through some mailing list or you can

1115
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,200
submit a GitHub issue I think that's the

1116
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,599
typical patterns and the INR path is

1117
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,940
usually followed by other ietf

1118
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,680
registrations because they just suck it

1119
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,240
up when the document gets you know

1120
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,660
submitted

1121
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,740
um but but also thinking about you know

1122
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,740
how can we fine-tune the text around uh

1123
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,960
that collection point to make it easier

1124
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,359
for people coming into the process to

1125
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,859
understand what they need to do and to

1126
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:02,160
set their expectations and and I would

1127
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,720
suggest that maybe one of the reasons

1128
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,300
why GitHub has been more successful is

1129
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,980
that you can iterate much more quickly

1130
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,680
with that you can go and and tweak the

1131
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,420
text and if somebody has a question you

1132
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,740
realize you haven't covered a point you

1133
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,960
can go and put it in whereas right now

1134
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,480
through no fault of their own we have to

1135
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,220
go and ask Ayanna to tweak the test on

1136
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,780
the page and that's a very manual and

1137
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,000
kind of clunky process

1138
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,920
so uh that's one area to investigate

1139
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,680
the other thing that comes up for me is

1140
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,240
is that right now we reserve the

1141
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,540
standards tree for uh things we consider

1142
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,640
standards uh that's why we call it the

1143
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,020
standard tree

1144
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,599
um and and we demote other efforts to

1145
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,240
you know the personal or vendor trees or

1146
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,960
whatever and and that has a couple of

1147
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,680
effects I think I I originally I think

1148
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,920
suggested opening up to uh uh just

1149
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,059
opening up this demonstrate completely

1150
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,099
and allowing any registration there we

1151
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:00,540
do that with a lot of other registries

1152
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,020
including HTTP headers URI schemes link

1153
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,079
relations uh there's no concept of trays

1154
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,720
in any of these and and especially when

1155
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,020
you have uh uh something go from you

1156
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,599
know not a proprietary use or or limited

1157
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,819
use to standard use if it does become

1158
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,440
common then you have that awkward

1159
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,480
transition of well do we rename it or

1160
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,040
not which you know we tried to address

1161
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,099
with the x dash uh draft a long time ago

1162
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,200
and I kind of see the vendor tree in the

1163
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,599
X tree or rather with the extra it

1164
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:33,000
doesn't exist anymore except for legacy

1165
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,460
and and the personal tree as as kind of

1166
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,880
other instanti instantiations of of the

1167
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,680
X tree

1168
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,660
um so so

1169
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,460
that was kind of my starting point I

1170
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,440
think in discussion you know it was

1171
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,640
pointed out that maybe we should just

1172
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,859
open up somewhat and say you know be

1173
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,780
more welcoming and and make it clear

1174
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,579
that we're more welcoming to open source

1175
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,619
projects for example and maybe that's

1176
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:57,480
the right line but we need to have a

1177
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,099
discussion about

1178
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,599
what's the right line for getting into

1179
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:02,339
the standards tree how can we make sure

1180
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:05,280
that you know that people who want to do

1181
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,420
the right thing in registered media

1182
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,660
types uh can do so uh and I don't think

1183
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,700
that that saying well because you're not

1184
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,260
a recognized standards developing

1185
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,119
organization you have to go into this

1186
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,859
ghetto over here that that's not really

1187
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:19,079
an acceptable solution uh for the the

1188
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:21,180
world that we live in uh but we do need

1189
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,400
to maybe have some criteria I I will say

1190
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,319
that in the other registries we we put

1191
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:27,420
more of the work on the expert to say

1192
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,819
well if somebody comes along and they

1193
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:31,800
don't seem to have a vital you know a

1194
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,960
project that's actually getting adoption

1195
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,480
and they try and squat on a name that's

1196
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,460
you know quite common and quite short

1197
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,980
don't let them do that make them use a

1198
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,420
longer name that's more specific to what

1199
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,400
they're doing so that we don't uh

1200
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,800
consume potentially valuable names as

1201
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,480
easily I think you know maybe

1202
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,579
discussions like that might help but but

1203
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,980
that's I guess the scope of what I see

1204
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,920
us discussing here

1205
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,260
thank you

1206
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,020
speaking as participants and since I

1207
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,460
joined the queue first

1208
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,680
and

1209
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,780
the

1210
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,420
the reason for making a somewhat onerous

1211
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,200
process for

1212
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,740
unprefixed names is I think that

1213
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,480
when we have two things that have the

1214
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,819
same name we want to make sure that they

1215
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:23,520
actually have the same definition

1216
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,079
so that they can tell whether they

1217
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,680
conform to the definition or not and

1218
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,559
we kind of come down that by requiring a

1219
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,160
stable reference and we're kind of

1220
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,319
required a stable reference by saying

1221
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,240
this reference is stable because some

1222
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,339
standards organization tells us tells us

1223
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:42,900
it is

1224
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,880
but you know

1225
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,339
application slash Ms word was kind of

1226
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,740
undefined until

1227
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,480
recently

1228
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,460
in history terms

1229
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,599
so

1230
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,520
and but I'll give the word to a Graham

1231
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,400
so can I

1232
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,640
um the points you made about open source

1233
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,240
projects an observation from what

1234
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,339
happens with URI scheme registrations

1235
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:19,140
one of the criteria that I've learned to

1236
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,900
apply on occasion is if some if the

1237
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,300
scheme is in widespread use

1238
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,640
then this can usually be found by doing

1239
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,800
a bit of hunting out on the web and that

1240
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,020
could be sufficient reason to allow that

1241
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,839
as a permanent registration so it could

1242
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,319
be a similar thing that applies here

1243
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:38,040
um

1244
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,160
something you you think the issue of two

1245
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,980
things should should be referring to

1246
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,660
this should have the same meaning if

1247
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,460
they've got the same name I would say

1248
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,079
that's an argument for making it easier

1249
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,300
to get the name registered

1250
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,700
so that they don't get used in the wild

1251
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,078
without getting registered

1252
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,079
Manu

1253
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,480
uh yeah I just wanted to speak in uh

1254
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,619
favor of um what Mark was suggesting uh

1255
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,559
in fact this is exactly how we operate

1256
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,280
the decentralized identifier registry at

1257
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,559
at w3c

1258
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,819
um so I A plus one to making it

1259
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:22,559
um you know be driven through GitHub

1260
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,200
that's what we do we provide a very easy

1261
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,020
template that just about any implementer

1262
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,940
can fill out it just has a few fields in

1263
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,839
it it's a GitHub issue template and when

1264
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,780
they raise that you know the experts are

1265
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,599
pinged and then we do a review uh

1266
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,640
threaded review just on the issue on the

1267
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,500
pull request itself

1268
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,319
um so uh on the whole it has definitely

1269
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,260
led to more engagement from

1270
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,880
non-standards uh people

1271
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,900
um uh uh we have a 140 basically 145 of

1272
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,460
these things were registered within the

1273
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,500
course of around two years

1274
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,680
um so we had a massive rapid rise in uh

1275
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,299
registered did methods somewhat you know

1276
00:59:05,299 --> 00:59:08,520
synonymous well they have the same kind

1277
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,700
of uh usage patterns as as media types

1278
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,700
so I think it's a good thing

1279
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,319
um but

1280
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,200
um what we have found is we have a bunch

1281
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,579
of people that don't know anything about

1282
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:22,440
standards that jump in and try and

1283
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,420
register these things and sometimes it

1284
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,940
takes an enormous amount of effort from

1285
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,940
the experts to teach people about what

1286
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,700
they need to do right so so that's

1287
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,579
stressing out the experts because not a

1288
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:38,160
week goes by before we you know we we

1289
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,319
have to teach these folks like what it

1290
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,059
means to have a decent spec and a stable

1291
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:44,400
reference and all that kind of stuff and

1292
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,960
even if we give them something to go and

1293
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,420
read they don't read it right so so that

1294
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,720
takes uh that's a a an increased uh

1295
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,280
stressor

1296
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,319
um the other thing that we've seen is an

1297
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:59,640
increased uh um uh squatting uh for for

1298
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,640
lack of a better term people seem to uh

1299
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,099
because we made it so easy uh it's

1300
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:06,780
really really easy for someone to go in

1301
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,700
and try and squat in a namespace and

1302
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,420
then we we ended up spending I mean and

1303
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,040
it's still going on the registration

1304
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,980
procedures we're having to keep changing

1305
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,020
because people keep trying to game it

1306
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,540
because there's so many more people that

1307
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,940
are you know attempting to do this so

1308
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,599
um I think the upsides uh certainly

1309
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,180
outweigh the downsides

1310
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,400
um but you know you have to be ready for

1311
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,819
the downsides if you adopt uh uh such a

1312
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:37,680
system they are manageable it's just

1313
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,599
more work for the experts and it's good

1314
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,480
to know that going in to the process you

1315
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,720
know we're now over time so I'm going to

1316
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,660
lock the queue in a few seconds

1317
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,520
and then we'll uh

1318
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,339
please be short

1319
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:56,339
okay Alexis so in regards to GitHub I

1320
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:58,020
mean

1321
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,480
let's try it and see we don't actually

1322
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,520
need to change any documents for this to

1323
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,740
try it out and if it's successful then

1324
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,359
well you know we can document it after

1325
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:07,440
the fact

1326
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,220
um and um in regards to sgo I think

1327
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:14,819
my preferred short-term fix is to expand

1328
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:17,579
the list and say that recognize open

1329
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:19,680
source projects are should be treated

1330
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,819
the same

1331
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:22,680
for this we'll need to write an RFC

1332
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,059
async

1333
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,240
uh like as I said on the mailing list I

1334
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,040
don't have problems with somebody like

1335
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,319
Debian registering they're actually

1336
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:34,260
using vendor-specific media types just

1337
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,940
fine but

1338
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,099
I don't have a mental problem with with

1339
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:41,339
them being considered as jail also which

1340
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:42,599
into

1341
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:46,040
um yeah I think

1342
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:49,440
Daryl Miller

1343
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,200
um just one of the impacts of the honors

1344
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,559
process is in the HP API space most

1345
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:56,880
people just don't bother they send

1346
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,760
application slash Json most devs don't

1347
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,680
even know what content type is for

1348
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,540
because the only thing they've ever seen

1349
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,180
there is applications last Json

1350
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,220
um I've been being harassed for four

1351
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,020
years now to go and register the open

1352
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,619
API media type and we haven't because we

1353
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:16,619
didn't have a stable organization

1354
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:19,200
despite its widespread use so it does

1355
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,599
have a negative impacts I believe the

1356
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,160
the

1357
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,140
and positive impacts but there are some

1358
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,000
negative

1359
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,200
thank you Mark

1360
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,780
I think what we might be talking about

1361
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,280
is

1362
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,640
um giving the experts a bit more

1363
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,579
discretion as well as guidelines about

1364
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:45,000
who they admit into the standards tree

1365
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,579
um and I'm glad ones are necessary but

1366
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:48,839
discretion is going to be necessary as

1367
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:51,720
well because if the if we just say open

1368
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,599
source well I can create an open source

1369
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:57,000
project in about 20 seconds

1370
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,460
um that's no barrier and so you need to

1371
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,140
have some some qualifications you need

1372
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,660
and it's going to require judgment uh

1373
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,400
there's an appeal process there so I'm

1374
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,200
not too worried about that you know they

1375
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,579
can always appeal to the 80s if they

1376
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:10,140
feel like the expert get it's wrong gets

1377
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,700
it wrong but we're going to need to be

1378
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,220
comfortable allowing the experts to make

1379
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,720
those sorts of decisions

1380
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,579
and we might put in gardens you know it

1381
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:19,140
might be that the bar is considerably

1382
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,740
lowered if you prefix your your name not

1383
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,140
with vnd or PRS but with

1384
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,440
Microsoft dots or or something you know

1385
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,260
so that it is in a namespace uh or maybe

1386
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,819
not a DOT because that would conflict

1387
01:03:32,819 --> 01:03:35,040
with trees but

1388
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,200
sorry

1389
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,799
yes so so I I retract the dot

1390
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,299
um but but if you know this is what we

1391
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:44,940
do often with HTTP headers is we say you

1392
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,559
know you you're doing this application

1393
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,540
this is specific to your application so

1394
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,220
prefix it with your application name so

1395
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,079
that we don't worry about conflicting

1396
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,460
with anybody else's use and and

1397
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,780
everybody's clear about what's Happening

1398
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,780
Here we can talk about that as well

1399
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,780
foreign

1400
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,299
gets the last word

1401
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:07,140
so the issue about uh registrations

1402
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,079
being onerous is intention intention

1403
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,940
with the issue of wanting to get people

1404
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,859
to register stuff that they're actually

1405
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:15,839
doing in real life

1406
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:19,079
and this was behind the structure we

1407
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:22,200
introduced for message headers and URI

1408
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,660
schemes which allows a provisional

1409
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,640
registration which has got very light

1410
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,579
touch entry requirements that doesn't

1411
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:32,579
have the full status and doesn't have

1412
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:35,880
the same level of expectation that it's

1413
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,680
there forever and then the permanent

1414
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,540
registration which elevates it to

1415
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,579
something closer to a standard or

1416
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:44,480
recommendation level

1417
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,440
thank you

1418
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,819
and now we are over time so

1419
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:53,720
I'll ask

1420
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,579
do we have anyone who's who wants to

1421
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:59,460
volunteer to write up a note or

1422
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,440
something about yeah Mark it's

1423
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,079
volunteering yeah

1424
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,540
so he's going to write something that we

1425
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,420
can in the form of an ID or in the form

1426
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,799
of something else that we can then

1427
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,540
criticize and

1428
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,540
file banks on and do pull requests on

1429
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,520
right

1430
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,359
