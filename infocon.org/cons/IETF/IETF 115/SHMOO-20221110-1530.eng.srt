so um it's going to be a really short

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,019
meeting so I will take the minute so

26
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,540
we're not looking for a minute taker so

27
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,420
um just keep going further

28
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,819
uh going through the deliverables itself

29
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,260
so there's like we had a couple of

30
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,180
deliverables we had

31
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,000
um two rfcs published so thank you very

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,560
much for the authors and like everybody

33
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,599
who commented so we had like the

34
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,640
cancellation considerations on running

35
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,920
an ITF hackathon said they've both been

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,159
published srfcs and we had like two

37
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,700
documents that are still left uh on our

38
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,680
plate and where we have working group

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
documents and we like multi has

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,920
completed the working group Last Call on

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,019
it so the next step is really to

42
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,440
progress these documents uh further and

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,180
so there's like I think like pretty much

44
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,560
all the comments that have been received

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,840
have been addressed so and Martin will

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,360
uh have a short question for the working

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,580
group now

48
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,879
and after this is complete our goal is

49
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,180
really to progress the documents uh

50
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,640
after completing the last call

51
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,019
um comments and all those things are

52
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,099
addressed

53
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,339
and our intent is to drop all the other

54
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,440
deliverables so we had something about

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
Cadence like how many on-site meetings

56
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,220
how many uh virtual meetings we're gonna

57
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,540
have so all those things were like

58
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,300
potentially work items uh similarly

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,639
technology requirements like so should

60
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,620
we have new tools should we use existing

61
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,000
tools all those things are really stuff

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,259
under consideration when we got

63
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,900
chartered a couple of years ago same for

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,360
hybrid meeting planning but

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,699
um we didn't have any drafts in the in

66
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,440
the recent past that materialized for

67
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,199
this so our goal is to drop these

68
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,919
deliverables like um and and just go

69
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,259
ahead to close the working group so

70
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,900
um

71
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,580
for that

72
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,639
I would just say that the of the dropped

73
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,560
deliverables

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,800
um the hybrid or sorry the Cadence

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,139
um I just wanted to for folks who've

76
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,880
been on Mini couches

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,400
from before shmu was chartered you might

78
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,860
remember one of the proposals coming in

79
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,500
was maybe we could reduce

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,360
um in-person meeting Cadence to only two

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,180
times a year and have the third one

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,440
um remote

83
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,240
again this was pre-pandemic and

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,860
everything I just wanted to say that I

85
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,860
think the outcome of

86
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,039
having robust remote participation for

87
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,400
all three meetings that happen every

88
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,139
year is actually a really wonderful

89
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,419
outcome rather than thinking of

90
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,880
in-person in-person online and you know

91
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,820
that um

92
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,400
I think is a is a good outcome so

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,560
um there's a cue now though

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,940
so go ahead

95
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,919
perfect thank you thanks Mallory uh

96
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,479
Martin do you want to go ahead with your

97
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,060
question yeah oh this is related to what

98
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,560
you're talking about uh what happened to

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
Mark Nottingham's draft

100
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,300
um that he presented a couple of itfs

101
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,160
ago did we just not progress that or

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,479
yeah

103
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,860
um we didn't hear anything further right

104
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,320
like from uh Mark like we can probably

105
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120
go check with them but I think the plan

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,440
would be like you know if there's

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
interest in that in progressing that we

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,639
can either talk to Lars now like I can

109
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,080
probably check with Mark like after

110
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,539
because like we did ask for uh what do

111
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,740
you want to do with it because it got

112
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,240
referred to us from gender's past right

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,280
it wasn't proposed here so it's kind of

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,960
like sitting in somewhere in between so

115
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,000
we can check with them see if he wants

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
to do something with it

117
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,360
um if not we can just like go ahead but

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,880
I think last has also offered uh to

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,380
Eddie sponsor stuff if there's something

120
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,300
that comes up like in in the near future

121
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,819
right but I think this is a good point

122
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,319
to kind of declare success as like

123
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,759
Mallory are saying right like we kind of

124
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,139
made quite a bit of progress during the

125
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,139
pandemic like and we've done pretty well

126
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,840
right like uh and like so if there's

127
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,539
like something that's like maybe Corner

128
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,800
cases or stuff like that we can actually

129
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,979
handle it now and uh so like I can

130
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,419
certainly take it as an item for myself

131
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,940
to go check with Mark to see to be clear

132
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,860
I'm not strongly advocating for this

133
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,240
group to take that draft I just thought

134
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,380
it was a loose end thanks that sounds

135
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,120
good so but but we did ask him right

136
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
like you know I think last meeting cycle

137
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,419
we kind of did chat with them to ask for

138
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,940
it thanks

139
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,699
so even so I'm not gonna let you adopt

140
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,319
it

141
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,419
so because the energy is out has been

142
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,560
out for a while I want to close the

143
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,060
working group you're right if there's

144
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,300
additional work either on those miles

145
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,800
Milestones that we had that were

146
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,660
dropping now or other related things in

147
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,580
the middle is going to stay open I'm

148
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,560
willing to 80 sponsor Jen dispatch can

149
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,180
like dispatch it to me and then I will

150
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,220
decide what to do with it but I think

151
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,900
the working group can go sounds good

152
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,340
thanks all for participating this might

153
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,680
be the last rule meeting thanks and um

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,259
yeah and uh the final thing is really

155
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,599
the uh the mailing list will remain open

156
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,180
so the mailing list predates the working

157
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,280
group and it'll stay open so we can have

158
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,780
all the fun conversations that we had

159
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,280
before the working group of storm you

160
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,139
can have it after as well thanks

161
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,759
Martin did you want to have your other

162
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,360
question now

163
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,259
good afternoon everyone had I known I

164
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,000
was the only agenda item I maybe would

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,440
have proposed to cancel the meeting but

166
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,680
here we are uh so um the the online

167
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,380
meetings draft is through the

168
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,479
working group last call but I was going

169
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,340
to do an editorial pass on it and then

170
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,620
like I think it's kind of caught halfway

171
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,740
between being a

172
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,900
historical record of our pandemic

173
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,000
experience and like

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,039
uh recommended best practices going

175
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,360
forward and it's listed informational

176
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,320
draft

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,640
so

178
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,479
um

179
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
like how should it be written is it is

180
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,039
it a is it primarily a

181
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,380
like a BCP that has some informational

182
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,940
background or is an informational

183
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,320
document with someone like here's some

184
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
things you might want to try and it's

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
like BCP the appropriate if it's

186
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,240
currently informational is BCP the

187
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,120
current proper status like how should we

188
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,620
shade the

189
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,519
the content

190
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,420
um last second I'm not going to let you

191
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,600
change the status either

192
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,480
okay so um it stays well it's an

193
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,920
information document that got accepted

194
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,380
and um let's keep it as such I would say

195
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,760
unless you strongly object or anybody

196
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
else strongly attracts

197
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,540
because I don't mean

198
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,580
it seems well I know

199
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,820
I don't really care super strongly but

200
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,920
do you

201
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,839
um

202
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,240
well enough to have this have this uh

203
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,820
agenda item but um I'm not gonna I'm not

204
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,880
gonna like a bonus higher for BCP than

205
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,260
for an information sorry that was

206
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,660
inappropriate but so I I don't think it

207
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,260
in in practice it doesn't matter right

208
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,899
um also because I think we found with a

209
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,640
lot of these documents that that we've

210
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,959
written right

211
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,880
that the lessons from the pandemic have

212
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,519
shown us that they sort of apply in

213
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,800
general but maybe the aspiration of

214
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,080
having BCP level guidance is a bit too

215
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
strong because you know things didn't

216
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,260
develop quite as we planned and we learn

217
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,459
all these things because it's the first

218
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,440
pandemic that any of us has been in

219
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,779
right so so you can make it PCP because

220
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,940
the other ones were BCP I think

221
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,040
it's still more of an informational

222
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,140
thing anyway sure and and to be clear

223
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,700
like there are parts of that draft that

224
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,320
have never been field tested like the

225
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,899
scheduling algorithm so uh

226
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,440
fair enough uh Lars before you run off

227
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,399
um

228
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,160
uh is it okay if you like editorally or

229
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,959
just sort of written like a BCP like

230
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,959
with 2119 words Etc

231
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,779
that is fine for me as an 80 if you want

232
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:34,920
if you think they make the document

233
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,660
clearer I don't I don't mind leaving

234
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,720
them in okay

235
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,100
hotels

236
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,620
yeah Charles eckel so you know I

237
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,940
definitely think we we learned some

238
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,620
valuable things going through this and

239
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,839
so to the extent the document can can

240
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,240
capture those and share not just exactly

241
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,519
what happened but kind of where we

242
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,380
currently are

243
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,779
um I think like like what was mentioned

244
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,440
the the thought of hey we we actually

245
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,180
remote participation is working really

246
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,600
well and with that people might choose

247
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,019
to only go to two meetings in person out

248
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,140
of the three but the ietf isn't you know

249
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,200
at this time deciding to make one a

250
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,660
forest virtual for everyone you know so

251
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,120
I think some of those types of thinking

252
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
that type of thinking I think came out

253
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,980
of our experience so it would be

254
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,200
I think the document right now kind of

255
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,060
is on the the fence it kind of gives

256
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,339
some some guidance for how you might

257
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,620
want to do things and then it also in

258
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,000
some cases as you were mentioning it

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,980
just says this is sort of what happened

260
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,180
and

261
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,220
that guidance and that learning is

262
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,019
important I think so I'd like us to

263
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,120
capture it if it's informational then

264
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
hopefully that's not uh too

265
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,600
controversial

266
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,880
okay so I think what I'm hearing is go

267
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,980
ahead and do that Martin uh do this

268
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,260
editorial passes informational

269
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,060
um it will be like the pr will be a lot

270
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,160
of words but

271
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,899
um we'll not have any substantive change

272
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,140
in what it what it's saying cool thanks

273
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,519
when

274
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,260
um sorry one clarification and so then

275
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,399
it wouldn't go through another working

276
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,260
group last call we could just kind of

277
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,060
everyone could look at it and if they I

278
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,620
think maybe just probably have a hold

279
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,000
off period saying like there's a new

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
draft like you know if you have some

281
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,060
comments like give it like two weeks or

282
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,100
so and on a hold on timer and then like

283
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,800
progress it if nobody complains I I I

284
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
think like one of the other things like

285
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,220
if Lars are saying that if you if you do

286
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,079
this you need to reach out her like if

287
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,300
you want to change it to BCP right so I

288
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,920
think that's really not worth it come

289
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
with last on that yeah okay that works

290
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,100
um so I will have that PR

291
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,959
um ideally by Thanksgiving certainly by

292
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,640
the end of the month and then we can

293
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,620
move forward thank you perfect thanks um

294
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,360
Ted you had your hand up and down did

295
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,620
you want to say something or has it been

296
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,360
said

297
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,639
okay thank you Stuart did you want to

say something

299
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,880
I didn't want to say something serious

300
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,560
but

301
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,899
um uh with the end of this work group I

302
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,639
want to express my gratitude for the

303
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,740
ironic scheduling that the staying home

at the stadium

318
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,279
just like

319
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,279

50

322
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,620
technology

323
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,899
you know there's a scene at the very end

324
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,180
of Ferris Bueller's Day Off where he

325
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,899
comes out and says it's over go home

326
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,240
you might need to play that to the room
