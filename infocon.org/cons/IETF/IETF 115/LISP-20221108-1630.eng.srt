hi good

8
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,479
I thought this was on the other side oh

9
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,039
it's going back and forth yeah

10
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,360
yeah no I was next door but then I

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,000
thought this was there so I went there

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,240
nothing someone else

13
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,439

welcome everyone

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,819
you are the at the least working group

19
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,500
meeting this is not a jump in the past

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,340
is my mistake I left the itf114 just

21
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,739
uploaded a new deck but apparently the

22
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,520
system doesn't update regularly uh

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,739
anyway

24
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:38,940
um

25
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,280
they're not well you signed it

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,280
everything we we speak today here is a

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,540
contribution

remote please use the full client

35
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,220

just to remember remind to everyone to

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,260
that we are here to to speak technically

39
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,420
and we have to respect each other each

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,140
and every time

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,080
uh the usual admin slide we have some

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,959
news apartment here apartment here is

43
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,190
the new co-chair okay I welcome her

44
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,840
[Applause]

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,540
that Joel was here for the beginning of

46
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,019
this session because I actually have

47
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,319
an award for him

48
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,060
for a decade long working group chair

49
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,659
you cannot read here but as a typical

50
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,659
ITF Style

51
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,680
I have this for him if you can read

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,459
and

53
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,060
on the back

54
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,140
can you read that

55
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,080
I will give it to him as as soon as I

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,400
can

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,180
he did a wonderful job uh

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,340
we reach a good Milestone with the main

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,760
specifications

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,139
I will do it it's a good idea anyway on

61
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,540
the screen you have the the usual

62
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,120
pointers the Julie prune audio stream

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,540
mythical as I said please log in on the

64
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,000
onsite and remote steam okay and

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,520
everything is on the data tracker

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,500
concerning the the material

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,780
good news we have eight new documents

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,040
that have been published since 114. as I

69
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
said this is also the Merit of Joel that

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,780
it brought some some work on that

71
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,940
this is an important Milestone because

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,979
finally we can focus on other work okay

73
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,400
we also have the the freedom to

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,500
recharter and discuss on what we want to

75
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,600
focus okay this later on today

76
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,639
uh there are a few documents that are

77
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,280
already in the pipeline or have the name

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,360
encoding hexagon pops up and young young

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,940
is close actually we should

80
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,000
start to push that one we will have

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
today an update of a couple of those

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,020
documents okay

83
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,380
and last slide from our side is the

84
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,560
agenda so we will have a Sharon giving

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,900
us an update on hexagon

86
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,100
then we have uh dino uh uh with with the

87
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,139
chair coordinate in the satellite

88
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,300
networks this isn't the right order you

89
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,060
ask it okay we updated the agenda we

90
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,919
switched the the this to presentation

91
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,639
because Dean asked for is better for him

92
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,860
we have uh prakash with the scite

93
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,620
external connectivity

94
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,039
there is a last minute request from

95
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,560
Alberto to give a short update on pops

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,560
up so after the prakash he will take the

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
mic for a couple of minutes

98
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
and then all the time left to start

99
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,660
discussing on rechartering okay

100
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,120
so unless there are through the comments

101
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,120
uh I guess we can switch to Sharon okay

102
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,720
let me Sharon are you online right yeah

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,639
yes yes I apologize for that

104
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,500
I apologize for the travel restriction

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,780
okay so here you're loud and clear go

106
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,340
ahead

107
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,819
okay it's uh more NASDAQ related than uh

108
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,759
covet related but whatever all right so

109
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,740
I would like to share with you

110
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,800
um a few updates uh on this hexagon

111
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,100
since Vienna uh two relates to the ad

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,740
review and to relate more to Industry

113
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,960
developments which are associated with

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,639
the draft

115
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,419
next please

116
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,819
okay so is everybody's pretty much aware

117
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,160
uh by now the draft combines your

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,060
special uh grid IDs and these eids for

119
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,419
Mobility geolocation networking

120
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,900
um just uh starting this effort there

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,060
were two choices potential choices for

122
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,960
grids S2 and H3 and but since S2 is more

123
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,860
geometry mapping GIS Atlas kind of

124
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,280
oriented H3 was better Suited

125
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,460
for dynamic real-time conditions what we

126
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,979
attempted to do real-time Network

127
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,380
aggregation addressing because of its

128
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,419
simple hierarchy and simple neighbor

129
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,759
propagation

130
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,120
um as requested by Alvaro we added an

131
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,940
lcaf for cleaning and coding h3ids into

132
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,940
eids uh with the kind help of Dino and

133
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,160
Alberto so you can see though they are

134
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,660
now in the draft

135
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,199
we also updated the references from the

136
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,660
Beast to the actual rfcs congratulations

137
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,960
everyone

138
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,400
uh next

139
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,039
um

140
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,020
the network is addressed and the packets

141
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,680
are keyed by HQ IDs for values based on

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,900
bdd taxonomy

143
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,139
so it was requested by Alvaro that these

144
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,840
two consortiums review the draft

145
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,899
uh h3o was kind enough and really

146
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,360
excited about the new networking use for

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,020
their grids but pointed out one issue

148
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,820
which relates to hexagonal hierarchy

149
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,339
um it's basically the fact that

150
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,740
um hexagons are great for neighboring

151
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,740
and they're like a circle but they're uh

152
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,440
like not a circle which is good

153
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,260
um so they tile but the in hierarchy it

154
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,040
may happen if the

155
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,500
Delta between the detection resolution

156
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,980
and the Eid resolution is too far the

157
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,959
detection resolution may actually be

158
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,620
outside the Eid area

159
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,519
um so uh that was pointed out and the

160
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,760
suggestion by H3 was uh not to go up the

161
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,220
tree father father to get from the

162
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,480
detection

163
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,459
ID to the EAD but rather to ask for the

164
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,160
center of the detection tile and then

165
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,180
ask for the Eid of that Center so that

166
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,899
we get the correct uh Eid resolution so

167
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,480
that was fixed in the in the draft

168
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
uh bdd was asked to confirm that the

169
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,860
enumeration of detections

170
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,920
out under the draft and assumed uh more

171
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,420
or less localization ability around

172
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,519
50 meters that can be Consolidated by

173
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,940
eids is reasonable for removing vehicle

174
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,899
with a reasonable on-board Computing

175
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,940
um they confirmed that

176
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,459
uh offline they said they really

177
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,660
recommended

178
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,779
that when we enumerate speed limit signs

179
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,360
uh we actually read them

180
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,279
what is the speed limit because these

181
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,640
signs keep changing a lot so we did the

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,600
ad that uh to the enumeration

183
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,060
uh next

184
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,940
so so far this is for the draft related

185
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,160
to the review and I I would like just to

186
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,080
say I apologize for the number of the

187
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,899
revisions uh as I discussed with Joel I

188
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,779
have some challenges with English

189
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,540
written English sentence structure so

190
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,579
sometimes I write something it looks

191
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,980
perfect and then it's just

192
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,579
unintelligible so apologize for that

193
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,760
um next as far as industry

194
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,779
um oh no no up please

195
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,300
go up yes thank you so

196
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,839
um the ACC

197
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,720
has made public an interoperable

198
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,440
multi-party test uh that detecting the

199
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,860
free parking spaces in Tokyo based on

200
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,440
hexagon kddi provided the access Oracle

201
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,140
provided the edge compute locations the

202
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,540
network locations between access and

203
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,440
Edge were tied up by hosted rtrs next I

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,980
provided the the AI car cam stack and

205
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,500
the AI consolidation stack but really

206
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,540
this is unlikely that one window will

207
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,300
provide both because there are many

208
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,360
equipment gear vendors and multiple

209
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,600
Mobility service providers but that was

210
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,339
good enough for the test

211
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,060
uh the RTR pickups uh were analyzed by

212
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,060
kddis and were used to prove that uh the

213
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,820
steering worked meaning uh based on your

214
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,300
location uh the uploads were steered to

215
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,880
the location of the nexagon where the

216
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,920
hexagon is right now and it could be in

217
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,579
either sites uh that subscription to

218
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,680
nexagons uh for areas of interest uh uh

219
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,500
worked and no matter where the hexagon

220
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,959
was the signal free

221
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,140
um multicast found the vehicle

222
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,480
uh that was there was subscription

223
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
subscription continuity and uh and Geo

224
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,899
privacy meaning no tracking for the

225
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,260
based on the vehicle eids

226
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,720
uh the pscs now will be extended to more

227
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,279
detections more vehicles and more

228
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,360
special areas now in the US

229
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,839
next

230
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,360
uh an additional POC that will be made

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,180
public uh it will dramatically increase

232
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,459
the the Frog fragmentation aspect of the

233
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,240
setup uh Cisco Wi-Fi private 5G

234
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,240
breakouts will be used to upload And

235
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,240
subscribe to a much higher distribution

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,339
than Edge data centers uh more like uh

237
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:14,220
uh servers in Toyota gas stations or

238
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,800
dealerships and that would be a lot more

239
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,440
fragmented and this will push the lisp

240
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,200
aspects much stronger than the initial

241
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,240
PLC did

242
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,720
um but these reflect uh industry trends

243
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,300
for green

244
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,220
low cost and high capacity connected

245
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,920
Mobility it's a strong pressure

246
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,699
okay next

247
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,040
okay so this brings us to additional

248
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,120
industry related uh

249
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,220
Trend which we hope to prove through

250
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,639
nexagons and can be generalized later of

251
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,760
automatic digital twins I mean hexagons

252
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,320
is the twin of the street but there is

253
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,700
twins of the

254
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,639
and and vehicles and the drivers and so

255
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,060
on uh in in principles digital twins uh

256
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,700
are are based on connected sensors

257
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,060
um uh for compute objects which reflect

258
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,639
some kind of asset

259
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,399
um so this has a little do with the lisp

260
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,899
as you can see in the drawing in the

261
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,240
middle it's just connected sensor to a

262
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,279
digital object uh but if we examine a a

263
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,680
few differences between digital twins in

264
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,540
a like a closed domain like a factory

265
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,860
versus

266
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,860
um an open field like a city we see

267
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,820
clearly why at least and can if you have

268
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,839
been to the buff yesterday are clearly

269
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,399
clearly valid

270
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,880
um for example uh in a factory image I

271
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
may have a twin of um

272
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,540
a a an engine or a thousand engines but

273
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,240
in the city I may have uh in the day

274
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,220
millions of engines and at night just a

275
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,480
thousand engines so that's the

276
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,699
difference between office servers and

277
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,399
hundreds of servers uh same for the

278
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,000
street uh a lot more busy a lot more

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,760
detections during the day so we need

280
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,959
that kind of elastic steering

281
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,839
um also

282
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:17,519
in a factory there will be a stable

283
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,220
access uh in the city there'll be

284
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,620
multiple providers and breakouts so

285
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,920
that's very fluid and requires list of

286
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,779
abilities

287
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,360
um and as far as sensors like in a

288
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,579
factory or a testing track I will have

289
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,620
fixed sensors for every segment of the

290
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,040
track or a wind tunnel in the city the

291
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,800
vehicles are the sensors so one minute

292
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,839
the vehicle is sensored for one segment

293
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,060
the next minute is a sensor for another

294
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,339
segment and that kind of Dynamics also

295
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,519
lends itself to lisp also geoprivacy and

296
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,440
preventing Tracking not relevant in a

297
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,660
factory very well in the field

298
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,260
to that we add the fragmentation we

299
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,060
talked about

300
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,279
and that fragmentation

301
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,839
was brought up yesterday in the exactly

302
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,940
uh yeah it was brought up yesterday in

303
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,000
the buff and it's very real uh and it

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,260
has very strong economical push uh so

305
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,480
the fragmentation which is supported by

306
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
lisp uh nexagon

307
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,279
um

308
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,240
allows uh geospatial twins to expand and

309
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,079
occupy more Edge locations uh so

310
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,860
educations are considerably cheaper as

311
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,100
far as gpus than Cloud

312
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,300
um the reason is that they are priced at

313
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,480
35 cents per kilowatt per hour uh versus

314
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,660
the cloud which is a lot more and

315
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,820
um and this has to do with there's no

316
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,180
spine in the edge there is no physical

317
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,639
ability to do a spine

318
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,820
um there's also uh no Monopoly and um

319
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,720
and in addition uh that that's why the

320
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,400
pricing is uh is very different

321
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,400
um

322
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,919
also as far as access

323
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,500
the pricing of uh breakouts uh whenever

324
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,760
they're available in the middle of the

325
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,599
city or are are priced per UE and not

326
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,119
per gigabyte like the carrier So within

327
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,400
the city and busy areas and busy uploads

328
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
we would use them a lot and when we go

329
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,260
on the interstate we will use the uh the

330
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,080
carrier uh one more thing as far as

331
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,820
green is uh Edge locations are starting

332
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,520
to get powered and cooled by hydrogen

333
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,460
and that's a lot cheaper than uh

334
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,020
connecting to the grid okay next

335
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,600
so if we look at the generalization of

336
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,320
this approach if we tie the fog

337
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,260
fragmentation with lisp we can we have

338
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,900
significant savings uh compared to uh

339
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,299
uh one Spectrum from carrier uh one

340
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,559
consistent Spectrum which is very

341
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,820
expensive

342
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,280
um uh cbrs is

343
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,419
free uh and uh compared to compute on

344
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,880
the cloud the difference is uh is the

345
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
difference between economically viable

346
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,380
and not economically viable for all

347
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,299
kinds of reality plus applications like

348
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,700
an hexagram

349
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,299
next

350
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,179
oh this is a a quick example if I

351
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,340
compare the upload of four dollars per

352
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,780
gigabyte using uh continuous spectrums

353
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,799
um for 1 000 frames per second the frame

354
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,840
is about 100 kilobytes a detection frame

355
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,799
that's 260 terabytes per month uh if I

356
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,380
do it using one Spectrum it will cost me

357
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,240
a million dollars a month if I do it

358
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,140
using um uh

359
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,600
fragmented uh hotspots it will cost me

360
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,780
72 000 a month that's a big difference

361
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,020
and as far as compute the the most

362
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,299
optimal numbers when all the Ducks are

363
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,299
in a row will cost you a hundred dollars

364
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,160
for a million frames in the cloud that's

365
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,660
260 000 per month but at 35 cents per

366
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,940
kilowatt hour plus depreciation it will

367
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,679
only cost me ten thousand dollars per

368
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,220
month in um The Edge the only downside I

369
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,520
have to manage my own elasticity my own

370
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,120
uh roaming and I do that with lisp and I

371
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,160
can get to these numbers

372
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,760
that's it

373
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,678
any question

374
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,520
seems not so thank you Sharon we

375
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,260
we go to dinner

376
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,919
next

377
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
um

378
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,480
the jail coordinates yeah thank you

379
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,039
okay thank you okay I'm gonna present uh

380
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,280
the list Geo prefixes next slide

381
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,220
so um this presentation this is an exact

382
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,200
repeat of the presentation given

383
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,780
November 2016.

384
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,760
um and it basically says there were no

385
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,700
changes to the documents from zero two

386
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,980
to zero fourteen so all those doc all

387
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,380
those revisions were just references and

388
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,480
resetting the timer so nothing has

389
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,700
really changed in the document

390
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,600
go ahead next

391
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,780
um okay so the changes from the initial

392
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,799
document to zero two is basically

393
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,100
um uh let's see uh

394
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,260
changes to reflect the new encoding that

395
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,960
was going to match Isis ospf and bgp

396
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,740
encodings of geocordinates

397
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,419
okay

398
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,299
basically what's on the left is what the

399
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:12,600
zero zero draft produced

400
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,940
um and then we moved it to what's on the

401
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,039
right and that's exactly what the other

402
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,679
all four protocols do now

403
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,039
um we made altitude larger

404
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,640
and we are allowing for

405
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,620
um centimeter granularity and that's why

406
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,120
the latitude is being measured in

407
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,640
milliseconds latitude and longitude are

408
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,340
being measured in um in milliseconds

409
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,820
okay

410
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,020
and then there was a lot of commentary

411
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,720
about geocordinates and privacy so we

412
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,179
put in a big section uh there and you

413
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,919
could read that in comment if you'd like

414
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,419
basically referring to BCP 160. okay

415
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,220
next

416
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,740
so mylispers.net implementation

417
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,840
implements it and this is a use case

418
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,419
that I was trying to to use and what's

419
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,460
this showing is these are entries

420
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,380
mapping entries in the mapping system

421
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,220
this is we're looking at a um

422
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,159
we're looking at a map server right here

423
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,280
that is being configured in VPN or

424
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,740
instance ID 1000 and what's being

425
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,780
accepted there are distinguished names

426
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,200
as the Eid so San Jose New York Paris

427
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,679
London Tokyo SJC and CDG so they're

428
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,760
cities and airports that are there okay

429
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,960
those things are being registered so if

430
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
you go down and look at the the

431
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,299
um the bottom left hand side this is an

432
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,340
example of Paris this is the actual

433
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,740
mapping now we call this mapping a Geo

434
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,460
prefix because it's actually defining a

435
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,559
point in the center of a sphere so

436
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,080
building a geofence three-dimensional so

437
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,340
it's just not a circle on a 2d space but

438
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,960
three-dimensional I guess you can't go

439
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,700
below earth but you can certainly go up

440
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,240
in in the sky so you can decide so a Geo

441
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,700
prefix is what I treat as just like a

442
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,220
regular IP prefix it has a point as you

443
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,960
look down at the bottom there and a

444
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,380
slash 100 the one 100 defines the radius

445
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,860
of the sphere in kilometers okay and

446
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,179
then on the right hand side you can

447
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,640
actually register a geode point where

448
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,480
CDG is the a Paris airport and its GPS

449
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,000
coordinates are there uh

450
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,740
um on the bottom in the right

451
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,880
next

452
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,280
so what you might want to do and my my

453
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
implementation has

454
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,720
um a Geo test sort of thing and you can

455
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,320
ask the question like is the point the

456
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,419
geopoint CDG

457
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,380
in the Geo prefix Paris right so when

458
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,600
that lookup is done what what happens is

459
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,360
the lookup is done on both of those eids

460
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,940
those are distinguished named eids and

461
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,380
if you look at the bottom that's the

462
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,500
result the result says the Geo Point 49

463
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,480
blah blah blah 34 is CDG and these are

464
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,140
these

465
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,679
coordinates and then if you look up

466
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,520
the Eid prefix Paris you get the prefix

467
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,620
and then you can just do a GPS

468
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,340
measurement and note is that 49 34

469
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,280
whatever within that slash 100 and the

470
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,080
answer is it is inside of it and it's

471
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,120
actually 23 kilometers away from the

472
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,280
center of the sphere so that's a use

473
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,299
case

474
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,280
so you know what what's a practical use

475
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,039
case for this is uh well maybe you have

476
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,679
a geofence around San Francisco and you

477
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,299
know there's an epicenter for an

478
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,520
earthquake you may want to send packets

479
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,140
to all the eids that are within 10

480
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,299
kilometers of that epicenter and so

481
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,740
that's something you can do you could

482
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,919
retrieve all the IP address Eid so you

483
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,200
can send pin messages ping messages or

484
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,260
or TCP connections or whatever

485
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,360
next

486
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,620
that's it and we made a request for

487
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,480
working group about a week ago I guess

488
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,059
or last week yes this is running a call

489
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,700
for adoption so if you support this

490
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,559
document please go to the mailing list

491
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,880
and say so

492
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,740
other than that if there are any

493
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,280
questions

494
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,320
um just a couple comments

495
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,340
um

496
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,779
it's good that you

497
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,020
um

498
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,600
meet the formats the same as ospfs and

499
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,299
bgp if you notice those drafts didn't go

500
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:40,080
anywhere in those working groups mostly

501
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,980
because

502
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,440
if I remember people were concerned

503
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,460
about

504
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,400
uh publishing location right of what a

505
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,559
publishing location oh yeah right and

506
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,720
and good letting other people know say

507
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,080
in the case of bgp that my competitor

508
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,320
knows where my router is right right and

509
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,480
you know that may uh you know create

510
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,340
many many things

511
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,179
um

512
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,120
so having said that if the working group

513
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,460
wants to work on this uh you know I

514
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,159
can't stop you of course uh just you

515
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,120
know be

516
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,919
conscious of that that you know there's

517
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,820
going to be a lot of questions around

518
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,559
privacy

519
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,020
um which is my second point you said uh

520
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,240
BCP 160

521
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,000
there's another RC you want to look at I

522
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
think it's 69 73 if I'm looking at mine

523
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,960
from here okay but I'll put it on the on

524
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
the chat

525
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
um that is called privacy considerations

526
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,460
for internet protocols and what we

527
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,679
probably want to do is besides or maybe

528
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,480
instead I don't know of what the

529
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,279
security section says actually have a

530
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,200
privacy considerations so that when

531
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,260
people look at this and see Geo whatever

532
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,120
they're going to immediately jump there

533
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,500
right and then everything is going to be

534
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,360
explained there and how it's not going

535
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,760
to escape and how so distinguish it from

536
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,640
the security consideration section yes

537
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,980
exactly I've seen some people make it a

538
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,480
subsection or a completely different

539
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,779
section or whatever just to to track the

540
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,279
attention of people

541
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,640
that want to look at this so can I

542
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,880
comment on your first point yes um uh I

543
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,220
assume are you done you have yeah okay

544
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,020
so

545
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,820
um what you register the mapping system

546
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,940
about location can be static things like

547
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,100
the example I used right everybody knows

548
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,779
where Charles de Gaulle Airport is and

549
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,159
where Paris is

550
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,980
um should you assign geocoordinates to

551
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,340
routers and and hosts and things that's

552
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,500
a completely different matter

553
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,559
um if somebody decides to do that well

554
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,960
it's just like should you sell some a

555
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,480
gun to somebody and that's their finger

556
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,679
who pulls a trigger but if the gun

557
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,299
wasn't there that's your point right

558
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,159
yeah right exactly that that's the point

559
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
that that

560
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,700
um yes there are many use cases there

561
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,740
are probably fine

562
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,720
um there are probably use cases that are

563
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,419
not yeah and or that

564
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,760
it depends on who used the uses them and

565
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,200
who sees the location and what they

566
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,620
could do with it right so um just make

567
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,360
sure that now the mapping system can

568
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
restrict map requests so you could be so

569
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,200
you hit using the ecdca draft you can

570
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,960
sign map requests and and then you can

571
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,179
you know exactly who is requesting it

572
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,860
and they can be authorized right so all

573
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,179
those things you want to put in the

574
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,179
consideration so that uh that way you

575
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,299
you limit who can see this yeah and you

576
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,980
know Etc just you know General comment

577
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,539
right thanks

578
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:34,620
hey

579
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,779
um do you know one thing I wanted to say

580
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,760
is that specifically if we're talking

581
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,400
about different kind of families of of

582
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,260
what can be like for example Charles

583
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,220
girl there's no privacy on it it's a

584
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,200
building that could be a hospital it can

585
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,140
be you know very specific

586
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,039
um public places so uh we were having a

587
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,799
discussion before about possibly we

588
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,159
could actually group those in very

589
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,400
specific instances or very specific ways

590
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,940
of identifying them and I think then you

591
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,679
could actually have your drill privacy

592
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,679
kind of Soul by saying these are the

593
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,260
class of objects that are already known

594
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,679
so there's no privacy yeah

595
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,260
and yeah we can use um maybe instance

596
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,899
IDs and say the all the public ones if

597
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,120
you want to publish yourself in

598
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,159
to the mapping system and you want to be

599
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,480
public and you don't care where your

600
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,580
location is then you register it to

601
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,559
instance ID 1000 where if you want

602
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,380
privacy you do it to instance ID 1001

603
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,840
and then that's severely restricted on

604
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,600
who connects 1001.

605
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,820
tell me about you know special emergency

606
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,820
response those can be really good use

607
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,679
cases where you actually want to see

608
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,200
them you know you want to know and it

609
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,179
might be that only certain people can

610
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,220
actually look them up

611
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,220
and have some restriction there yeah and

612
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,640
if you want you can obfuscate it or um

613
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,440
uh aggregate it where you don't have to

614
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,360
give the Geo point of where you are you

615
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,980
can give a Geo fence that's 20

616
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,840
kilometers and you're somewhere in there

617
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,460
but they don't know exactly of course a

618
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,020
bomb could take out the 20 kilometers

619
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,840
but knowing exactly where somebody is

620
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,240
which room on which street that could be

621
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,620
obfuscated a little bit yeah

622
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,799
there is a question from Sharon

623
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,200
uh yeah I'm wondering do you know if we

624
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,380
can combine uh Goa IDs with ephemeral

625
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,679
and uh sort of handle the Privacy

626
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,899
meaning keep changing they can

627
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,520
coordinate with the person

628
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,919
just an address which is right for a

629
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,039
while

630
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,520
you catch all the words

631
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,539
it broke up a little bit can you repeat

632
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,820
can you repeat the shot on please

633
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,460
yes I was wondering if it's possible to

634
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,860
combine

635
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,260
geoeids with ephemeral eids

636
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,720
so that they are good for a while

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,860
Oh you mean they're only they're

638
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,200
ephemeral in terms of how long they

639
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,000
exist in a mapping system

640
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,960
yeah and uh if you want to keep uh being

641
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,700
known to be in a location you have to

642
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,940
keep uh generating new ones

643
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,220
absolutely you can you could send a map

644
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,620
register once with a short timeout and

645
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,000
when it times out the map server will

646
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,140
just remove them

647
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,240
so that that that will solve we can

648
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,860
solve that pretty easily with existing

649
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,899
machinery

650
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,200
okay absolutely and if you want

651
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,720
if you want short timeouts but you and

652
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,220
you want them to time out quickly then

653
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,779
you just send refreshes just like any

654
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,240
other map register so

655
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,460
or you can send deregisters as well from

656
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,799
the the point who registers

657
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,380
so yeah we could we we could certainly

658
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,919
support that

659
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,580
okay satellite

660
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,539
next

661
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,640
okay so I'm just gonna um go over some

662
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,779
high level goals there's a little bit

663
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,080
repeat from the last ietf but um a list

664
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,820
of overlay is something that can run

665
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,460
over an IP delivery Network which is we

666
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,260
call the underlay and today when you run

667
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,179
this overlay over the capital I internet

668
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,100
we just use the capital I internet

669
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,279
however it looks with independent of its

670
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,720
interfaces and types of routers and

671
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,340
everything that's underneath we just use

672
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,380
it and we know it'll deliver packets to

673
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,299
our logs okay

674
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,279
um if a satellite Network can deliver IP

675
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
packets it's just another example of an

676
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,600
underlay and so a list overlay can run

677
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,580
over that if you wanted to exclusively

678
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,580
run it over a constellation it will do

679
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,039
just fine if and also if the satellite

680
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,720
network is part of the capital I

681
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,399
internet then it should work just fine

682
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,720
as well

683
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,279
um point being here is that there's

684
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,380
really nothing that has to change in the

685
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,179
satellite Network to make lisp run over

686
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:51,960
it

687
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,059
so very much like lisp runs over the

688
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,980
3gpp network

689
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,500
um by running it at the very edges or

690
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,299
actually in the notes in the 3gpp

691
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:02,399
network or the nodes that are in the uh

692
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,080
in the icon Network the airline Network

693
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,799
um

694
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,140
it could just it just works because it's

695
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,640
just different types of components that

696
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,600
deliver IP packets next please

697
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,419
okay so how does it work it's pretty

698
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,860
straightforward there's no Eid state in

699
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,380
the satellite underlay right it only

700
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,779
routes to Arlo so encapsulated packets

701
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,880
by lisp get delivered from our look to

702
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,860
our look as long as the satellite

703
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,220
Network can deliver IP packets

704
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,019
um then there should be no problem with

705
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,480
this encapsulation note that the

706
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,279
satellite network is unaware of all the

707
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,440
ID State as well as any overlay that's

708
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,760
running over it so it knows no

709
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,799
difference of a TCP connection is going

710
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,860
over it or lisp encapsulated packets and

711
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,539
of course the underlay Network can

712
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,899
transport ipv4 or IPv6 packets and can

713
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,940
be dual stacked just like the

714
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,640
um the capital I internet is too so we

715
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,700
can use you can use either address type

716
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,100
to make it work and a combination of

717
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,940
both as well when path optimization in

718
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,980
the underlay is available the our local

719
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,820
record could help the satellite Network

720
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,800
route packets through it so if you're

721
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,560
using a satellite network with lots of

722
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,480
isl's inter-satellite links and you want

723
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,699
to select the path if you seem to have

724
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,800
more knowledge than the cell network you

725
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,619
can make suggestions we've also talked

726
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,780
about maybe satellite networks will be

727
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,119
using GPS coordinates to find the down

728
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,460
link which satellite is the downlink to

729
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,800
where you have to go so maybe if those

730
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,080
GPS coordinates are in the mapping

731
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,940
system that's associated with the rlook

732
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,540
of an XTR then those that pair can be

733
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,099
used together

734
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,839
that's something we could we could add

735
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,320
as a a use case uh in a paragraph in the

736
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,619
satellite spec next

737
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,080
so this is what it would look like the

738
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,680
top square is basically space and you

739
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,240
see the satellite networks that are up

740
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,160
there and there's lasers that connect

741
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,619
them together in a vacuum inner the isls

742
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,540
or the inner satellite links and then we

743
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,460
have up and down links that are usually

744
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,760
run with RF type technology and all

745
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,800
we're doing is we're defining

746
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,320
um a new type of XTR called a GS a

747
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,720
ground station XTR it's just a regular

748
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,960
box that sits down there that's a lisp

749
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,260
XTR and it just has an interface up to

750
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,780
the satellite and of course what you do

751
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,780
is eids are attached to the GS XTR they

752
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,880
come and go and those are the ones that

753
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,500
get registered with the Arlo that's

754
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,320
associated

755
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,119
right here

756
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,339
so lisp runs in those boxes and the

757
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,500
mapping system is on the ground

758
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,099
next

759
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,000
so what what are the sort of features

760
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,820
you get well edies can roam from gsxtrs

761
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,920
to another and keep their connections up

762
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,380
so just like an Eid can roam from uh

763
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,440
once like a VM can roam from one server

764
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,780
to another the eids are assigned to the

765
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,839
VMS it's just like a mobile device or

766
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,839
anything else and that's um uses all the

767
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,640
Machinery that's in the Eid Mobility

768
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,460
draft right and if you want the zero

769
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,440
packet loss things you can kind of

770
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,680
assume where the Eid is going to move if

771
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,060
it's moving

772
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,960
um you know across GS xtrs and you know

773
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,339
the direction you can use predictive

774
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,380
Arlo's and packets could be going to the

775
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,359
places you're about to arrive at and so

776
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,040
you can get zero packet loss that way

777
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,140
just like we did for the

778
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,660
um other use cases

779
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,480
um GSX TRS can load split traffic across

780
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,339
uh different R logs they could be our

781
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,960
looks of the satellite link or other

782
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,960
links that the um GS XTR has so you can

783
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,760
actually load split between space and

784
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,740
ground if you need to or use it as

785
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,720
backup

786
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,420
um and all packets that are encapsulated

787
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,599
can use list crypto and therefore if you

788
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,160
want everything in space to be encrypted

789
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,920
from XTR to XTR that certainly is

790
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,440
available okay

791
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,820
now

792
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,480
GS xtrs can use an alternate path and

793
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,460
use most of the traffic engineering

794
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,560
stuff that we have in the traffic

795
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,020
engineering spec so for example that

796
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,839
first bullet there that says an XTR may

797
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,020
send a packet up to the satellite that's

798
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,839
in its aperture range and that satellite

799
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,420
then typically will send it over a laser

800
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,460
to another satellite maybe you want to

801
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,500
reach something half the circumference

802
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,619
of the earth and so we would go up over

803
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,780
and then down that would be the the

804
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,119
typical case when it's not doing the

805
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,859
even simpler case where it just goes to

806
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,940
one sat and then comes down okay but for

807
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,760
policy reasons you might want to have

808
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,400
the satellite go up and come down to an

809
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,420
RTR

810
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,339
and I'll show you examples of the

811
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,780
testing I've been doing why that's

812
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,940
necessary so you may go up to a

813
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,040
satellite back down to the ground back

814
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,260
up to satellite and then back down so

815
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,820
that would be something that would be

816
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,099
needed and and as we realize that's

817
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,599
something that might be needed because

818
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,420
maybe the connectivity is maybe there's

819
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,160
congestion in the in the in the

820
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,140
particular orbit that this satellite is

821
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,880
in and it doesn't want to switch Orbits

822
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,500
for whatever reason or there's

823
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,180
congestion or there's lack of

824
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,060
connectivity because what we have now is

825
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,200
we have

826
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,420
um a bunch of systems on the ground that

827
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,760
are either static or moving around using

828
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,859
a network that's totally mobile all the

829
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:29,579
time right the satellites are moving 2.7

830
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:30,560
um

831
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,660
meters per second or like 17 000 miles

832
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,480
an hour so these things are not standing

833
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,460
still and they're moving very fast so if

834
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,200
you try to do anything clever like

835
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,180
synchronization by the time you

836
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,980
synchronize things when you're ready to

837
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,480
use it they're going to already be out

838
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,040
of date

839
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,339
okay so what we can do is we can use the

840
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,200
list to underlay Telemetry by using our

841
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,480
load probing to actually measure the

842
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
performance between xtrs on the ground

843
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,020
and we could actually find out how much

844
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,880
variability we have in the satellite

845
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,380
Network as well

846
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,400
okay

847
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,980
and then the second to last but GS

848
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,560
xtrs can offer Eid multicast Services by

849
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,720
doing head-end replication again head

850
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,700
and replication is there to offer a

851
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,099
multicast service model to eids even

852
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,420
though that the underlay doesn't support

853
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,579
native multicast so it just does head

854
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,400
and replication to unicast arlooks where

855
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,859
there's no reason why it can't do this

856
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,599
over the satellite network if that's its

857
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,920
only path

858
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,200
and also note that eids can talk to

859
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,859
non-eids and the path may be either the

860
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,480
encapsulated path maybe over the

861
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,520
satellite Network and then it comes down

862
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,140
and then it gets decapsulated and sent

863
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,420
to a non-eid

864
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,820
um or it can go even farther so all the

865
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,619
inner working stuff just works as well

866
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,660
because there's no there's no special

867
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,400
properties that make things difficult

868
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,619
for an overlay to run on other than the

869
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,440
satellite Network just has to provide IP

870
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,420
address routing

871
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,020
next

872
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,880
okay so the changes from we wrote the

873
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,099
zero Zoo draft early this year and

874
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,480
presented it

875
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,440
um in um in Philadelphia in June or to

876
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,839
July and um there were some comments

877
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,800
about

878
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
um should the mapping system be put in

879
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,339
space

880
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,079
um will it be will it be needed there

881
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,660
because of better latency if for some

882
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,460
reason list pass to be put in the

883
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,500
constellation well at this moment in

884
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,300
time we see no reason that lisp has to

885
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,700
be put in the constellation but there

886
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,320
was another common saying is what if a

887
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,560
GS XTR only has a satellite link and has

888
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,619
no terrestrial links okay will it be

889
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,780
able to resolve things using the mapping

890
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,359
system and the answer is yes because the

891
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,520
mapping system is accessed via Arlo's or

892
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,040
routable IP addresses and if the if the

893
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,560
satellite Network can reach that part of

894
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,359
the network and and the services that

895
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,920
are offered with most of the satellite

896
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,720
networks today is that you can reach the

897
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,099
entire internet by just sending

898
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,040
something up we said that um that the

899
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,200
gsxtr should have no problem and the

900
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,700
mapping system on the ground should be

901
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,079
able to serve all these different

902
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,700
combinations

903
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,220
okay and then what we also added to the

904
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,839
zero one spec was a bunch of test

905
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,800
scenarios that that I'm about to um

906
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,160
present to you now

907
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,260
so I went out and I bought a starlink

908
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,119
dish I mounted at the top of the roof

909
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,480
the roof of my house and I started doing

910
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,540
some list tests on it and when you look

911
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,420
at this top diagram there's a there's

912
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,920
satellites they're starlink satellites

913
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,200
there's about 3 500 of them now roaming

914
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,560
in different orbits um in Leo and when

915
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,260
you buy a starlink kit you get a dish

916
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,940
that's about the size of a pizza box

917
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,220
that's labeled dish there and you get a

918
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,280
Wi-Fi router okay so what I did is my

919
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,619
lap my personal laptop is basically

920
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,680
acting as the GS XTR running lisp okay

921
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,720
so I was able to do experiments I

922
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,180
connect my WI-Fi to the starlink Wi-Fi

923
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,579
router and I'm off and running so these

924
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,800
are all the test cases that I have

925
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,760
tested the top diagram is the is the

926
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,940
case where it's GST xtrs are directly

927
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,339
connected to the satellite network using

928
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,859
non-nat this is really important okay

929
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,380
this has not been tested because

930
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,079
starlink router is a Nat device the

931
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,839
Wi-Fi router is a Nat device okay so you

932
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,400
you it's hard to reach each other

933
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,380
without doing the natural versal logic

934
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,540
and lisp okay okay if you look at the

935
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,300
bottom half this is how it works with

936
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,180
Nat so if you say if you say my laptop

937
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,220
is there on the left hand side the only

938
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,859
way I'm able to reach anybody else is to

939
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,619
encapsulate my packets to the RTR so

940
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:39,000
actually when the packets are

941
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,740
encapsulated to the RTR they go to the

942
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,200
rtr's Arlo so the satellite network is

943
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,079
delivering it to a Colo down where the

944
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,420
list RTR is located it turns out the

945
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,119
list bar TR is running in on Amazon AWS

946
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,420
VM so it actually wherever the satellite

947
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,460
wherever starlink decides to downlink to

948
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,619
whatever Colo I think it uses a lot of

949
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,540
Google infrastructure that the packet

950
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,880
then is routed from Google to Amazon to

951
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,400
get to the lisp RTR and then the list

952
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,339
bar TR then can encapsulate to the GS

953
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,079
XTR on the other side which is also

954
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,300
doing that traversal so that that has

955
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,680
been tested

956
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,700
next slide you know we should speak up

957
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,619
okay okay

958
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:20,700
um

959
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,560
so this just shows the case where the

960
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,119
laptop on the left hand side is talking

961
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,640
to a list of xcr that's in a VM just

962
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,440
doing encapsulation so this is the case

963
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,200
where the XTR is not directly connected

964
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,180
to the satellite we tested that

965
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,859
um and then the top one was inner

966
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:41,220
working so can can an Eid the laptop on

967
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,780
the left hand side talk to a non-list

968
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,819
post and that's usually done through a

969
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:47,400
lisp RTR where we're using listnet where

970
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,319
the Eid is being translated to an hour

971
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,540
load so packets coming back can follow

972
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,940
that path as well and so that's been

973
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,880
tested and the bottom has been tested as

974
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,800
well next

975
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,900
this is the case that hasn't been tested

976
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,700
this is where we'll have just the phone

977
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,680
that's roaming that's not running lists

978
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,020
that will roam back and forth from a

979
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,119
Wi-Fi or GS XTR AP and I can do that

980
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,099
um on my laptop as well so we can have

981
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,319
Eid one move or in this case it's

982
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,380
showing eid2 is moving from one one GSX

983
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,319
tr2 another one and um all the packets

984
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,180
are being delivered by the satellite

985
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,400
constellation and the TCP connections

986
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,260
are staying up because the Eid address

987
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,619
doesn't change but just the our logs do

988
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,780
so this more testing of that's going to

989
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,260
happen so this is just a call for if um

990
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,000
anybody wants to do testing I need

991
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,160
somebody far away from the bay area in

992
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,740
California so I can do some um testing

993
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,800
and when the um satellite offerings do

994
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,300
ISL

995
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,220
um it would be nice to do an ISL testing

996
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,380
if I can if I can make that happen or

997
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,300
judge that it's happening so if there's

998
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,700
any volunteers that want to join testing

999
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,740
that's fine I'm really I'm even willing

1000
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,500
to offer to pay for your kids as long as

1001
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,180
you pay for the monthly costs for the

1002
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,819
service so unless you can convince Elon

1003
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,980
to sell you free stuff maybe if you're

1004
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,839
any of you live in Ukraine maybe we

1005
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,200
could do some testing huh

1006
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,000
is right

1007
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,500
so here's

1008
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,839
um and we're at uh oh so the question

1009
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:19,800
here is

1010
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,079
um is this interesting work to make it

1011
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,000
um a working group document

1012
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,240
um first of all there are any questions

1013
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,400
uh lihan

1014
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,359
is in the queue

1015
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,300
go Edwin

1016
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,520
I don't know so

1017
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,780
I have a question in the meantime maybe

1018
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,880
uh

1019
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,460
at the end of it the document in details

1020
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,280
but my question is does this document

1021
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,520
modify or extend the lisp uh

1022
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,980
specification in any way

1023
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,680
because it looked like just uh

1024
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,660
informational deployment

1025
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,359
document

1026
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,160
it's it's documenting the fact that

1027
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,660
lists can run over a satellite Network

1028
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,579
and it requires no changes to the

1029
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,040
architecture protocols that's what it's

1030
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,900
documenting

1031
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,000
okay

1032
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,140
um

1033
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,720
has been this discussed extensively on

1034
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,980
the mailing list

1035
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,160
I don't think it has

1036
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,260
that would be good if we discuss a

1037
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,060
little bit more about this document

1038
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,280
before going to the working group

1039
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,460
document so you want me to initiate a

1040
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,900
discussion of some sort that would be

1041
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,119
great for example I think

1042
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,339
can you hear me

1043
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:03,060
yes we hear you now okay so uh my

1044
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,359
question is uh I saw that XTR and the

1045
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,420
eib bounding doesn't change right

1046
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,520
you want to go back to the

1047
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,300
um

1048
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,940
yeah on this on this slide yeah

1049
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,280
so uh when the satellite link uh uh with

1050
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,859
Dish is changing do you trigger any

1051
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,000
updates

1052
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,859
absolutely not

1053
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,460
okay

1054
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,160
okay okay good basically what happens in

1055
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,339
this diagram is eid2 is registered with

1056
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,460
the Arlo of the GS XTR

1057
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,480
um on

1058
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,540
the it's the IP address of the wireless

1059
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,819
interface to the Wi-Fi router when the

1060
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:48,000
IDT moves IED two moves it's now

1061
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,160
registered with the IP address of the

1062
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,640
right hand gsxtr's Wi-Fi interface and

1063
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,180
that's got it got it so actually you uh

1064
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,980
actually push all work to IP layer to

1065
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,520
uh

1066
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,880
uh uh uh to advertise or connection

1067
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,380
between GS XTR to satellite

1068
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,500
uh no it's in the mapping system the the

1069
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,140
Eid to Arlo mappings are in the mapping

1070
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,599
system and the mapping system doesn't

1071
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:20,220
know how

1072
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,680
um the IP address are logs it doesn't

1073
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,599
know if it's attached on an Ethernet a

1074
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,480
Wi-Fi interface yeah that's what that's

1075
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,040
what I mean means that because the

1076
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,140
satellite network is not aware

1077
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,300
that's right

1078
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,599
just like just like my eids attached to

1079
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,819
my Wi-Fi router that has Comcast service

1080
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:44,220
and if I talked to Padma and she has

1081
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,800
Comcast you just change the satellite

1082
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,440
Network there to a terrestrial you know

1083
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,300
um cable network and it works the same

1084
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,240
way because all list cares about our

1085
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,099
eids and where they're located on the

1086
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,200
network not what's underneath the

1087
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,920
network

1088
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,319
and how the packets are being delivered

1089
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:05,119
yeah got it thank you

1090
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,920
okay thank you let's move forward we are

1091
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,960
running late so

1092
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,560
now it's time from prakash I'm going to

1093
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,060
share this slides

1094
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:19,460
here we go

1095
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,680
hello everyone this is prakash Jain from

1096
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,260
Cisco Systems I'll be presenting on the

1097
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,020
list of site external connectivity draft

1098
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,800
it's been there uh for a while in the uh

1099
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,099
uh published for a while co-authors are

1100
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:38,520
Victor Moreno from Google and Sanjay

1101
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,800
Huda from Cisco next slide please

1102
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,579
at high level the draft addresses the

1103
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,640
Dynamic external connectivity for for a

1104
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,160
list site

1105
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,500
and especially it is for the eids or the

1106
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,140
end point which are unknown or which are

1107
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,140
not which are known but not registered

1108
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,660
to the mapping system means they can

1109
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,760
they can be external to the to the

1110
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,500
mapping system or external to the site

1111
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,460
or they might be might be in the site

1112
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,220
but not registered yet

1113
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,140
uh so draft uh essentially uh suggests

1114
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,359
the mechanism how to register the proxy

1115
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,700
ETR for those endpoints

1116
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,599
and how to how to update those proxy TR

1117
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,839
dynamically at the ITR or ETR wherever

1118
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:34,200
it is needed and also how to request the

1119
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,300
PTR and also how to specify the PTR in

1120
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,780
the map replace

1121
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:47,579
now one one thing to note is that as

1122
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,140
part of this draft we are not changing

1123
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,020
any of the procedures or any of the

1124
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,819
record formats which list standard

1125
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,099
specified we are using them as it is

1126
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,280
only the contents how how the contents

1127
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,780
should be to address this dynamic

1128
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,700
dynamic external uh

1129
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,359
uh connectivity or or have the external

1130
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,059
connectivity dynamically changing

1131
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,140
now the what draft suggesting is that

1132
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,780
Eid prefix

1133
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,079
[Music]

1134
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,839
is the distinguished name either

1135
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,040
configured or it can be agreed upon uh

1136
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,040
distinguished name as per the list name

1137
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,599
encoding draft

1138
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,800
now the uh the pxtr or PTR should be

1139
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,859
specified as part of the r log set

1140
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:40,380
and those uh each locator in the unlock

1141
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,440
set can be or may may be encoded as per

1142
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,819
the list VPN draft to add uh to cater

1143
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:50,940
the VPN environments means your uh your

1144
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,099
pxtr could be in a different world or

1145
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,280
different VM

1146
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,380
additional information may be encoded as

1147
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,339
uh as a vendor specific alcaph type

1148
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:06,059
regarding the registering ETR or or the

1149
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,740
PTR itself

1150
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,559
anything if if needed that's a specific

1151
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,300
I mean it's very specific to the

1152
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,160
implementation next

1153
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,819
uh similarly the notification there's no

1154
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:22,500
change as in the procedures or the

1155
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,940
record format

1156
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,180
the Eid prefix can be distinct will be a

1157
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,460
distinguished name and as per the list

1158
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,359
name encoding draft uh uh ptrs will be

1159
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,059
will be included will be as part of the

1160
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,260
r log set

1161
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,359
now the only difference here in in the

1162
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,119
uh uh in the additional information is

1163
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,220
that now this information will be what

1164
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,640
map server or whoever is notifying wants

1165
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,819
to communicate to the ITR or ETR as part

1166
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:52,440
of the notification

1167
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,760
awesome

1168
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,020
yeah means we are not really changing

1169
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,119
anything in the message type so whether

1170
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:03,180
the message been used for

1171
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,300
uh if the pub sub is used or whether the

1172
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,059
request replies we use it's a question

1173
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,319
or should I wait

1174
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,059
go ahead okay

1175
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,500
um so I understand that the message

1176
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,420
format's the same but what's the reason

1177
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,940
you want to send a map notify

1178
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,940
okay so because it's a dynamic in the

1179
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,880
what we want to have is a dynamic

1180
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,200
adjustment of the PTR if there's

1181
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,480
something changes in the ATR it has to

1182
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,040
be updated at the ITR

1183
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,800
change or the metrics are changing

1184
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,020
anything changes at the okay so given

1185
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,720
the routes so that functionality is

1186
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,180
documented in Pub sub so it means when

1187
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,280
you register when you register the

1188
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,500
distinguished name you want to be able

1189
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,740
to set the end bit so it's a subscribe

1190
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,240
request okay yeah

1191
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,140
means it's not limited to it but it can

1192
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,300
it can be used there's no notification

1193
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,020
can also be used but the pub sub is also

1194
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,400
the answer should be yes

1195
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,280
because if you don't use it then you

1196
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,540
don't know what the mapping would have

1197
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,339
changed you gotta wait for timeouts

1198
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,880
but maybe let's finish the slides and we

1199
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,160
can discuss this also yeah we can we can

1200
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,020
discuss that

1201
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,720
more we can talk about and talk

1202
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,400
okay

1203
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,520
okay next one please

1204
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,440
the map request nothing is changing

1205
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,260
except that if it's needed the winter

1206
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,420
specific Healthcare can be used to

1207
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,099
communicate the information regarding

1208
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,300
the ITR

1209
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,280
next one please

1210
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,440
the main changes in the resolution in

1211
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,760
the map reply

1212
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,020
today when the eids are not known to the

1213
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,960
mapping system uh or if they are not

1214
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,160
registered to the mapping system

1215
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,500
negative map replies is sent in the

1216
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,780
negative map reply the r log count is

1217
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,680
zero

1218
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,380
the the graph is specifying that in that

1219
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,800
case Arlo count must be non-zero

1220
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,200
and it should include the PTR

1221
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,079
information as a part of the r log set

1222
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:16,440
or the locator set and with the r log

1223
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,839
encoding can be used either way either

1224
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,059
way as per the VPN draft or as a regular

1225
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,380
R log

1226
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,940
uh Eid prefix is same as the prefix uh

1227
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,480
in the negative map reply means it is a

1228
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,760
non-list hole as per the procedures as

1229
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,619
the standard procedure

1230
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,020
the

1231
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,339
the another thing is the TTL

1232
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:43,200
the draft is suggesting that the shorter

1233
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,660
TTL should be used because mapping can

1234
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,559
change

1235
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,559
and that's the one of the your question

1236
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:51,839
was that how it will be updated because

1237
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,359
the the TTL we are specifying is this is

1238
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:56,400
the smaller one now it may not be

1239
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,900
immediate you're right that pop star

1240
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,599
will be more immediate but it can be uh

1241
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:04,559
it can be taken care either by that

1242
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,240
uh

1243
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,000
additional information uh regarding the

1244
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,819
uh regarding the mapping itself can be

1245
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:13,380
communicated from the map server or

1246
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,420
whoever is sending the uh the map reply

1247
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:20,420
to the uh to the ITR next

1248
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,160
this is the example use case

1249
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,400
it's not part of the draft but uh it's

1250
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,720
here to show that this use case is using

1251
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,540
this this draft to communicate the

1252
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:38,640
default uh PTR information uh to the ITR

1253
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,740
or within the list site

1254
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,640
now this has been fully implemented and

1255
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,099
deployed in the field

1256
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:51,240
uh here uh the Eid prefix has been used

1257
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,000
as a as a default DTR distinguished name

1258
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,160
uh saying that hey this is the default

1259
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,000
path

1260
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,300
and our our logs there can be multiple

1261
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,760
PTR in dialogue as part of the locator

1262
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,180
set and those uh multiple locators can

1263
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,160
be in the redundancy or it can be in the

1264
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,980
load balancing mode based on the

1265
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,780
priority and weight as in the existing

1266
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,200
uh uh lisp standard

1267
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:21,059
now the map request here is the uh

1268
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,540
is is

1269
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:25,440
so there are two type of map requests

1270
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,480
here involved one is that if somebody

1271
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,520
wants the default ETR information before

1272
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,079
the packet arrives

1273
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,260
then map request can be done using the

1274
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,920
default PTR distinguished name as an Eid

1275
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,079
and the

1276
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,880
uh and uh means with this if there is an

1277
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,619
additional information needs to be

1278
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,240
communicated can we be communicated

1279
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,640
using the winter specific type now

1280
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,500
another map request is that when really

1281
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,960
traffic arrives at that time when the

1282
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,819
traffic arrives the map request goes as

1283
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:59,460
a regular map request now the reply will

1284
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,500
be a negative Maple in earlier case that

1285
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,240
replies the regular reply because this

1286
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,460
the Eid has a distinguished name and the

1287
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,819
r lock is the PTR now when the actual

1288
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,300
traffic arise because the Eid is the

1289
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,460
actual destination the mapping system

1290
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,400
does not have that that uh that

1291
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,400
destination so the reply is the negative

1292
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,859
is kind of negative map reply but with

1293
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:26,099
the modification of our love is non-zero

1294
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:29,099
foreign

1295
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,200
it's a contradiction of terms if you say

1296
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,819
you receive the negative map reply with

1297
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:41,160
a locator count of non-zero but I'm

1298
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,900
saying that it's similar to the Eid

1299
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,460
similar to the negative what's most

1300
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,799
important is what's the action value in

1301
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,980
that negative map reply

1302
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,079
so the uh

1303
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,520
that that uh

1304
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,780
maybe we can we can call it like a

1305
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,359
regular map reply with the uh with the

1306
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:03,359
Eid prefix similar to the Eid prefix of

1307
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,940
the negative reply or either way like

1308
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,720
but to the point this is not the uh this

1309
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,299
not communicating any action values it

1310
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,859
is communicating the

1311
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:16,559
ETR information wait wait wait wait wait

1312
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,859
you know we we should actually wrap up

1313
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:22,500
because we are in the last meeting of

1314
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,000
the meeting so

1315
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,299
do you mind going to

1316
00:59:26,299 --> 00:59:28,740
quickly I think this is the probably the

1317
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,700
last slide I have and next is just

1318
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,020
requesting for the working group

1319
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,160
adoption

1320
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,500
and any comments and questions or can

1321
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,359
continue

1322
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,400
to add something

1323
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,040
hey um Praveen I I do have a few

1324
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,619
comments so I went through your draft

1325
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:50,880
actually and I came up with a case where

1326
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,500
um I want to know exactly how you're

1327
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,960
doing this is that if you go in the case

1328
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,540
where you have a negative map reply

1329
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,640
right it's going to give you a range

1330
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,020
which is larger if you look at

1331
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,880
9301 it's going to give you a range

1332
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,980
which is larger for example if you're

1333
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,200
asking

1334
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,599
4.1.1.1 it's going to mostly respond to

1335
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:13,400
you

1336
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,780
that's the point I was trying to make

1337
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,059
that Eid prefix though we should not

1338
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:20,760
call it negatively I agree with what do

1339
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,380
you know is saying but the the reason

1340
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,819
I'm saying it looks similar to the

1341
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,500
negative ambulator because of that Eid

1342
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,680
yeah prefix whole prefix calculation it

1343
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,599
will be in in in that range which is the

1344
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:31,920
larger range than the requesting

1345
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,799
preference yeah exactly so exactly this

1346
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,500
is where I think we need to be extremely

1347
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,859
careful because at this point

1348
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,200
before you may have the negative map

1349
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,540
reply but you still don't have anybody

1350
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,359
attracting the traffic

1351
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:52,440
here you're going to have the Petr

1352
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,339
attract the traffic of everybody else

1353
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:59,040
who are not yet up because anything

1354
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,200
that's going to come up now

1355
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,079
are going to be actually attracted by

1356
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,700
that just like you were saying is that

1357
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,319
you have a non-hole what if somebody

1358
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:11,339
comes up with 4.2.1 Point there's no way

1359
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:14,040
that they're going to actually have a

1360
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:14,880
more

1361
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,819
you know a shortest prefix is going to

1362
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:21,359
match it but that is not going to change

1363
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,400
any of the thing which we do with the

1364
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,900
negative epileptic so let's say let's

1365
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,079
say today

1366
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,240
is default forward right

1367
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,859
look at the action code map server can

1368
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:34,079
say so here the purpose of this is that

1369
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,920
we

1370
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,020
wish we fall forward but encapsulated to

1371
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,700
the board

1372
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,500
that is the purpose so instead of taking

1373
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,200
the native routing path we want to take

1374
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,900
the overlay Parts towards the Border and

1375
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,079
that's the that's why it is

1376
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,980
functionality wise it's not going to

1377
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,960
change anything but other

1378
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,059
instead of taking the native path it is

1379
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:56,780
taking the capsule

1380
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,380
capsule

1381
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,559
yes yes

1382
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,900
we might want to continue yeah

1383
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,700
okay so one of the purpose for for that

1384
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,040
is that why is it deliberately done

1385
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,559
because we assume that when you are on

1386
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:16,020
the Axis or the edge side your box is

1387
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,480
smaller so box may not have all the

1388
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,980
information but when you are on the

1389
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,559
border you have maybe Pub sub already

1390
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,599
there which already know about this

1391
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,640
the discussion is interesting I'm sorry

1392
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,099
but yeah we are really over time

1393
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:34,020
thank you prakash

1394
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,339
um

1395
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,260
continue the discussion on the mailing

1396
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,780
list and we will reach that point about

1397
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,940
the working group adoption now it seems

1398
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,700
there are a few points to be clarified

1399
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:47,460
and uh and that we will probably usual

1400
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,640
thank you very much thanks Alberto

1401
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,400
30 seconds without sliding if you want

1402
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,260
to really to have a quick note on pops

1403
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,319
out

1404
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:00,900
46. you are asking too much go ahead

1405
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,900
yeah so first of all thank you Alvaro

1406
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,400

to get back to you we have done that uh

1408

and then I send an email to the list

1409
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,119
about moving perhaps up to propose

1410
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,160
standard so if you have any opinions on

1411
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,720
that please go to the list because this

1412
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,280
is something that has come over and over

1413
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,619
and yeah we want to to see if we are

1414
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:21,780
going to move it to our proposition

1415
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,420
that's it okay so please go to the

1416
