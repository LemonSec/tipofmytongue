14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,740

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,720
are in the room join through the on-site

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,560
version of the tool

and if by any mistake you register you

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,200
joined through the the full tool make

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,659
sure your sound is turned off

25
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,079
so that we don't have local Eco here if

you're remote please and and want to

27

speak make sure you use a headset

28
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,939
otherwise we would get ego as well most

29
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,298
likely

30
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,399
uh

31
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,880

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,619
already

33
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,679
and the one point I want to emphasize is

34
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,660
if you need technical assistance with

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,700

yeah I don't know

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,020
um we are taking notes on code EMD the

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,060
link is here on the second line please

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,140

your happy with the way it is

48
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,239
represented

we have a chat on zulip as well

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,400
and yes if you want to edit the minutes

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,620
you need to be logged in through the

52
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,760
data tracker and that will serve uh to

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,560
log into the the minutes as well

54
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,900
[Music]

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,780
give a working group a status

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,000
then we are going to provide some more

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,440
details in current documents like NSA

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,099
audio variable normal priority mopex are

59
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,420
in FD

60
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,879
then Pascal we provide the update on the

61
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,760
projection with the shipper document is

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,300
in progress then Pascal we provide as

63
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,580
well they work on six long multicast

64
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,319
registration

65
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,620
and then we have open floor for further

66
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,299
comments

67
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,799
uh it's okay some comments on the agenda

68
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,080
okay

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,620
okay

70
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,680
we have a message on the main uh display

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,019
here in front of us that says uh shut

72
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,840
down yes no I don't know how to say no

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,180
so if some some technician can see that

74
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,120
yeah right here

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,738
thank you

76
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,738
we put like no but yeah I don't know how

77
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,700
I think I have no control

78
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,880
[Music]

79
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,460
no not my computer this is

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,530
anyway we can do without it

81
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,719
[Music]

82
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,300
anyway so maybe yeah

83
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,040
I don't know

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,540
okay

85
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,620
um about the jello draft we are going to

86
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,860
provide some more details and

87
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,860
about the blue double projections

88
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,680
um is going to be discussed today

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
yep

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,800
so for the milestones we are a bit

91
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,979
delayed with the double projection so we

92
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,780
will need to ship it as soon as possible

93
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,580
and then for the jello ones uh we need

94
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,820
to put the efforts on completely those

95
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,479
works too

96
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,380
um next slides

97
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,660
okay okay now more details on document

98
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,020
status

99
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,759
okay so we're going uh we're going

100
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,220
through the list of a few uh drafts that

101
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,160
we have in the group and we don't have

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,020
the offers here to

103
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,460
talk on so we have an X NSA extension uh

104
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,060
just to remind everybody this is a uh

105
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,120
draft that proposes a new objective

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,820
function and a new metric container

107
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,600
extension to carry the set of parents of

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,180
a node in a Dio and that allows a node

109
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,580
that receives the diode to know its

110
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,639
potential grandparents and so we had the

111
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,080
adverse review in March

112
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,440
asking a few questions

113
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,780
providing comments 20 of those about 20

114
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,840
of those who are noted as major comments

115
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,699
and well yeah the authors are still

116
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,020
working on them

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,120
so please uh yeah I'll we keep bugging

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,460
them but we really want to move this

119
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,880
forward we need a revised draft before

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,000
we can send to our ESG so that's NSA

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,020
extension

122
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,580
that we have in the works

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,259
okay for the variable

124
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,240
basically this work introduce a dial

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,419
options or the road request options

126
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,900
route replay and target options

127
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,300
as well this work he introduced a new

128
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,060
multicast address with Lincoln link

129
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,599
local scope all the variable nodes

130
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,300
this draft as well use the same author

131
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,360
operation of P2P Ripple but they don't

132
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
Collide for example because they are

133
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,400
running different Ripple instances

134
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,680
so this is at the main contribution of

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,099
this work

136
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,419
yes

137
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:42,120
and based on the last comments in the

138
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,139
mailing list

139
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,020
they were a discussion from the outdoors

140
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,000
requesting feedback about the Ripple

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,300
instance ID pairing

142
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,720
how can you uh detect when you have a

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,660
lot of audible Ripples and connections

144
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,539
how can you the intermediate routines

145
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,419
identify the objective function so the

146
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,020
authors propose to use a

147
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,819
triple origin note Target note and

148
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,919
ripple instance ID

149
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,759
uh okay they proposed that but there was

150
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,979
not the comments on the main list so we

151
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,139
believe that this is accepted as it is

152
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,699
um yeah

153
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,979
then okay

154
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,820
um a new version was published on the

155
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,458
version 15 was published on September

156
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,320
basically this version address the

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,240
ticket one

158
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,958
um the discuss of uh John scooter

159
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,380
basically the comments were to improve

160
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,700
readability then address as well we

161
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,680
believe the address ticket to bend

162
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,500
discussion discuss

163
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,740
um to basically the discuss provide

164
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,000
comments to improve the protocol

165
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,779
um

166
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,820
the outdoors we believe I have addressed

167
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,920
all the comments they have replayed to

168
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,660
them but we have not heard back from

169
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,519
them of course because he changed

170
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,480
position

171
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,940
so we believe that those tickets as well

172
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,160
are addressed

173
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,519
then we have as well Pascal review

174
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,980
um but this one is the ticket number

175
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,000
three

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,459
there is some comments that you did

177
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,220
Pascal that still are in the in the

178
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,140
document they were not fixed

179
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,480
in the version 15.

180
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,940
so

181
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,200
um

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,420
do you do you know if the version 15

183
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,940
addressed your comments

184
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,300
okay okay so we will take us an action

185
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,820
point but yes there are some comments

186
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,940
that you did that there were not others

187
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,100
they were still the fifth version 15

188
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,860
with these errors so

189
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,700
um then the review by contract uh it was

190
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,279
addressed and we got comments in the

191
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,080
Middle East in October

192
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,899
so the next step will be

193
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,120
a new last call when all the issues are

194
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,640
closed this basically the Pascal review

195
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,980
okay

196
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,580
yeah

197
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,120
[Music]

198
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
um

199
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,839
Michael Richardson so this document's

200
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,600
kind of uh come and gone for

201
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,240
um seems like several years to me

202
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,959
um

203
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,019
I I look to see if some of the authors

204
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:37,980
are

205
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,920
on the on our meeting today and I don't

206
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,480
see them

207
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,140
um

208
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,079
and so I mean there are four authors for

209
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,120
a reason is so that we can deal with

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,220
authors different having different

211
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,860
amounts of energy and things like this

212
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,779
so I'd really like to see these others

213
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,120
authors maybe could get more involved

214
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,019
and finish this document and get it out

215
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,079
um otherwise it just it it's I think

216
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,899
very hard for all the reviewers to hold

217
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,180
on to review for sometimes years and

218
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,519
then figure out what's going on

219
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,320
um so

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,820
I don't know I think the working group

221
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,320
we should just kind of put a bit of a

222
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,279
deadline on on this and if we can't move

223
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,100
it forward by you know January 1st or

224
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,959
something that we should just take it

225
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,500
off our list

226
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,660
okay

227
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,279
um

228
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
yeah

229
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,060
thank you Michael

230
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,220
um yeah well Charlie replied that he

231
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,680
will work in last weeks and in a few

232
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,660
weeks but yes we need to put a deadline

233
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,579
for

234
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,940
to get this closed

235
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,140
um

236
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,339
then foreign priority well we have these

237
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,220
seven issues open

238
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,820
um so I think Michael you will work on

239
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,519
that when you have time right based on

240
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,839
we understood

241
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,160
yeah I'll

242
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,740
get on again

243
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,760
okay

244
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,600
thank you very much

245
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,140
um then mopex

246
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,160
just introducing for those who are new

247
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,700
to the group The

248
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,940
Ripple operates in multiple modes and we

249
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,420
have a mode of operation field in the

250
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,339
instance that describes the mood of

251
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,600
operation so that no no if and how they

252
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,180
want to join that instance and we've run

253
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,720
we we are running out of the the values

254
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,579
in that field so this draft is about

255
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,940
extending that field mode of operation

256
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,220
hence the name model preparation

257
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,740
extension

258
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,500
um so again that's a draft that has been

259
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,899
sitting there for long and we want to

260
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,220
revive it

261
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,820
as soon as we have the first ones out of

262
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,079
of the door

263
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,019
and we have a ticket and a few

264
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,139
discussions on flags that needs to be

265
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,980
agreed on

266
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
you

267
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,639
then fast forward rotary class detection

268
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,139
in Ripple

269
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,940
so this work was at the working group

270
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,820
um is proposed as an extension of Ripple

271
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,519
introduced a root note for detection

272
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,660
options that is carried in dios and this

273
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,620
this document is well proposed two roles

274
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,540
uh acceptor and Sentinels antennas are

275
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,639
the ones that are neighbors of the road

276
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,540
and then taking monitoring the route

277
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,459
and as well they have introduced a

278
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,560
counter conflict-free replicated counter

279
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,100
um then it was present in the last

280
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,779
interim meeting and there was a new

281
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,880
version published recently basically

282
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,600
with the editorial comments

283
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,680
um

284
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,100
then the questions here

285
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,240
um

286
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,000
basically were based on the discussion

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,899
how the Sentinels can detect if the root

288
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,560
is alive or not

289
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,339
um

290
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,920
so for example

291
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,860
um yeah what happens when the Sentinels

292
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,700
um

293
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,519
don't hear each others those the

294
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,440
algorithms still detect the crash of the

295
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,220
road

296
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,779
yes

297
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,360
um then what if most of the direct links

298
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,480
to the root fall but the root is is in

299
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,000
fact alive okay as well here the roots

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,180
take part in the monitoring

301
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,240
so they they can the root knows when

302
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,959
there's something else are full

303
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,600
and then if it's um

304
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,699
how

305
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,420
um the root get back to us that status

306
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,120
up basically to get a new DOTA version

307
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,139
um then there are some other questions

308
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,199
that they still need to kind of

309
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,699
contribution of the working group for

310
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:18,839
example

311
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,199
and where the counter is located and

312
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,680
it's a it's a for example in the option

313
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,300
tie option

314
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,459
and as well

315
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,180
um for example the when

316
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,880
um if the several Sentinels have

317
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,339
different threshold in order to detect

318
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,880
if the root crash how you which one you

319
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,940
take into considerations

320
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,339
um well actually you take the one that

321
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,459
has the lowest threshold but I think I

322
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,579
as well have to

323
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:55,440
be explained a bit more into the

324
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,699
document

325
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,620
um so these are basically the last

326
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,240
questions that were present in the

327
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,399
mailing list

328
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,120
um

329
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,940
I need more of the discussion or

330
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,040
contributions and reviews

331
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,820
and as well I think we get the document

332
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,899
Shepard

333
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,980
Michael do you want yes thank you so

334
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,420
Michael is the documentable of this

335
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,480
document and probably if all these

336
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,560
issues

337
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,899
are addressed we just can't move forward

338
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,880
with this document

339
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,660
do you agree

340
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,420
comments

341
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,060
okay

342
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,300
what else

343
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,660
for this

344
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,380
yes

345
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,860
okay I think Pascal now it's your turn

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,220
try this oh unless you just just tell

347
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,939
you when you're on YouTube

348
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,799
and

349
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
um this is about the

350
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,679
um right projection draft for repo so

351
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,599
just to give a sense of positioning a

352
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,720
sense of History we basically have a

353
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,580
main Ripple specification which is

354
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,440
an average purpose distance Vector

355
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,900
protocol

356
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,760
where

357
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,600
we save

358
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,520
energy by

359
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,000
optimizing routes from and to a route as

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,820
opposed to any 20.

361
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,340
and when we want if which because his

362
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,160
twist is kind of a rare traffic in usual

363
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,500
iot Networks now when we want to

364
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,179
optimize device to device Communications

365
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,240
there are basically two extreme

366
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,660
Solutions on each side I would say of

367
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,640
this main specification

368
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,580
the first extreme solution is to go

369
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,460
fully into the Malay world and this is

370
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,460
what the aodv specification does the one

371
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,020
that we just discussed and the Charlie

372
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,320
is is editing so this is a completely

373
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,559
reactive protocol where a device that

374
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,299
wants to speak to another device will

375
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,240
flood the network with a route request

376
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,380
message

377
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,140
which is effectively transported by

378
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,260
Ripple now the the other complete

379
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,520
extreme is when the East-West path

380
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,660
between two iot devices is computed by a

381
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,299
central controller which is more the

382
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,059
traffic engineering space and you would

383
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,440
say hey why do I need traffic

384
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Engineering in my sensor Network well

385
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,660
that's because not all sensor networks

386
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,220
are metals

387
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,280
there are effectively cases where

388
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,280
big robots or industrial appliances

389
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,140
sensors actuators plcs need to be routed

390
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,640
over Wireless

391
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,160
and as it goes Ripple is a fine solution

392
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,980
for this repo will build a main direct

393
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,840
sck graph for the devices to reliably

394
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,700
talk to the root and through the route

395
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,520
to the controller but then for any

396
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,039
particular route between a sensor and a

397
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,580
PLC or a PLC and an actuator that will

398
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,880
be the controller that will set up the

399
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,240
optimal path with enough redundancy

400
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,440
between the two devices and repo is a

401
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,419
protocol of choice for effectively

402
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,400
installing that path

403
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,039
and for those who attend row reliable

404
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,559
and available Wireless row will be the

405
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,679
place where we optimize the energy in

406
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,960
using those double projection projected

407
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,419
routes so there is a complement between

408
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,419
what we do here which is below the

409
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,160
controller to set up the traffic

410
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,760
engineered path that we call a truck and

411
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
a row where we'll effectively use that

412
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,160
track but just the subset of the Dual

413
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,740
dag between source and destination that

414
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
is enough to guarantee the level of

415
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,000
reliability that we want for for the

416
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,140
flow we're talking about so see aodv has

417
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,220
a really mobile adult networking extreme

418
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,400
of raw and see though projection on the

419
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,440
other hand as the fully controlled

420
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,100
traffic engineered side of Ripple

421
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,880
and Men Ripple covering like the overall

422
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,460
Center of that picture

423
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,360
press the button

424
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,660
and none of it

425
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,100
thank you

426
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,659
no not better

427
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,179
um

428
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,840
anyway soapy so um basically what that's

429
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,120
exactly what Dow projection is it's a

430
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,799
centralized

431
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,100
Rod computation method whereby a

432
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,299
controller

433
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,380
which is kind of hidden behind the root

434
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,480
will set up geodags within a geodeck

435
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,000
so typically you will build a main

436
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,400
geodag that connects to the root which

437
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,620
has enough redundancy Etc it's going to

438
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,220
be a non-storring mode Leo deck why do

439
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,200
we want that it's because non-storring

440
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,679
allows the route to already know a lot

441
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,559
of the topology of its Network

442
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,539
and what we will do with our projection

443
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,299
is extend that knowledge of the topology

444
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,240
with sibling information

445
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,480
so the the controller can effectively

446
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,620
build optimized East-West routes

447
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,980
we build two things

448
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,220
one of them is what we call a segment a

449
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,460
segment is something that complements a

450
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,120
geodag it's it's a

451
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,220
Serial Set of of routers A to B to C to

452
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,260
D and that's that allows to connect the

453
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,480
dots

454
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,700
so once you start doing this the first

455
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,919
usage that you can have is within the

456
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,860
main deal dag you may decide that your

457
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,380
Source route path now can be loose as

458
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,020
opposed to strict so you know with repo

459
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,059
non-storring mode you have this

460
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,820
situation where you have to to put all

461
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,000
the Hops down the geodag inside every

462
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
packet and that might be a long list

463
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,880
when you want to compress that list you

464
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,280
basically want to install the dotted

465
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,380
lines the the connection between the

466
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,440
dotted lines as storing mode routes

467
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,980
inside the non-storic mode geodag which

468
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,940
effectively Builds an hybrid solution

469
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,559
with the main geodag expressed as

470
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,059
non-storring but the data flowing along

471
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:04,620
storing mode routes which connect the

472
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,020
dots in the routing header so now your

473
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,539
routing header can become loose and it's

474
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,600
up to the controller to decide which

475
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,820
specific routes will be optimized

476
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,100
because as you know the main reason why

477
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,380
we are not operating storing mode for

478
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,080
most cases is because we don't know that

479
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,840
we have enough memory in the devices to

480
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,840
store all the non-storring mode to store

481
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,539
all the storing mode rods here it will

482
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,940
be the controller the root which will

483
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,960
know the capabilities of the devices and

484
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,380
only install as many routes as a device

485
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,480
can actually support

486
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
so it will be up to the controller to

487
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,919
decide hey here are the path The Source

488
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,679
right path that are used extensively let

489
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,200
me compress these ones it's more

490
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,360
interesting to save energy

491
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,100
within the capabilities of the nodes

492
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,840
along this path so that's what the

493
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,440
segments are a segment can be connecting

494
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,280
the dots in the main geodag or in what

495
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,440
we call a truck so track is this

496
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,059
East-West path

497
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,539
that is also a ripple geodag that is

498
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,179
also installed in non-storring mode just

499
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,460
like the main tier deck and then again

500
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,559
there can be segments to connect the

501
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,640
dots

502
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,400
okay so the track is loose structure

503
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,140
where that basically gives you the

504
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,080
skeleton of the geodag and how to go

505
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,240
between one node and the next node in

506
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,600
that skeleton is using again a segment

507
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,240
but this time a segment in that track as

508
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,240
opposed to a segment of the main geodag

509
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,059
so you can see the domain deal dag is

510
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,220
just like the track zero

511
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,700
and the uh optimized path between A and

512
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,400
B are

513
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,059
geodes as well just like the main track

514
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,340
next slide please

515
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,380
so this is basically representing what

516
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,860
we build I've shown that before there

517
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,900
are basically two

518
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,960
ways of installing projected routes one

519
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,280
is storing mode the other is

520
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,260
non-storring mode in Black in the middle

521
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,360
you can see a non-storring mode I'm

522
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,080
sorry storing mode pidau it goes to the

523
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,480
egress of the truck of the segment I'm

524
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,100
sorry and it will fly

525
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,919
to the Ingress of the segment and the

526
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,260
increase of the segment answers

527
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,640
if you look at it that's the way that

528
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,659
works a story mode though starts at the

529
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,840
end of the path and flows towards the

530
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,480
root which is the Ingress of that path

531
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,940
well same thing you flow from the end to

532
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,740
the beginning of the segment so it's

533
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,620
just a normal pedial it's just that

534
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,400
instead of being generated by the

535
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,500
destination like we do in normal Ripple

536
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,980
in this case it's it will be injected

537
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,159
really projected by the route into the

538
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,640
the egress of the segment

539
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,700
and now what we represent in in Gray on

540
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,059
the left is the track itself and the

541
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,299
track itself is a source rated

542
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,020
dotted line thing and in this track we

543
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,480
have relay a relay B and decrease e

544
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,600
which are connecting in Ingress I's

545
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,039
geodag

546
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,880
so what happens to build it is a single

547
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,980
non-storring pidau that goes to the

548
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,539
Ingress and the Ingress will reply

549
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,159
because the Ingress is the one which

550
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,900
will have the full topology of that

551
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,419
track it will not know the segments but

552
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,720
it knows all the relays so a b and

553
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,820
egress

554
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,000
and how you go from A to B well that

555
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,860
could be through another track which

556
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,140
means which means an underlay inside the

557
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,779
underlay or it could be through a

558
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,179
segment like we do between relay A and A

559
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,120
Class E so basically you can see a track

560
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,760
as an underlay that is dynamically

561
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,580
installed by Ripple in order to shortcut

562
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,640
to do like a wormhole between a an

563
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,679
Ingress and an egress

564
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,919
and it is installed on purpose by the

565
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,980
controller and the amount of redundancy

566
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,620
that you can have in this geodag and the

567
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,080
the reliability of the links Etc it's

568
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,000
all known from the controller so the

569
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,340
controller in order to ensure a certain

570
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,039
amount of reliability will provide

571
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,559
enough redundancy in the possible path

572
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,440
in that Geotech and then as I said row

573
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,020
we'll use that dynamically to optimize

574
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,539
spectrum and energy

575
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,700
so you see in this slide two main lags

576
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,500
basically one is on the North and one's

577
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,840
on the south we call them legs and then

578
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,020
we interconnect the legs with not

579
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,559
exactly north south segment but

580
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,260
East-West but up down segments in row

581
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,600
there is the concept of no self segments

582
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,700
which can be used in either direction

583
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,980
but in Ripple we don't know how to build

584
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,919
that because we only build the attacks

585
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
so you see there is always this angle

586
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,779
you're always going slightly uh to the

587
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:07,679
right

588
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,520
next slide please

589
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,380
so draft status we started the work

590
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,039
group let's go at 29 for all I know

591
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,580
um the all the issues are resolved with

592
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,279
the latest version which happens to be

593
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,679
29 and it is my belief that we are ready

594
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,980
for publication next slide

595
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,260
so just to give a hint of what happened

596
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,400
so during IHF 28 we discussed a number

597
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,159
of things that could be improved or

598
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,440
clarified in the document

599
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,260
in particular we needed to clarify that

600
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,679
each Ripple instance each track

601
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,039
is effectively its own rib

602
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,740
and that's why as you know we have what

603
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,299
we call the RPI the Ripple packet

604
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,100
information in the repo packet it's

605
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,900
effectively the topology indication

606
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,640
which will tell you which rib you're

607
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,880
talking about

608
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,020
indefinite terms because I see some net

609
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,900
members uh it it is also the that net

610
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,159
path if you like that you're talking

611
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,740
about it's signaled by the Ripple packet

612
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,220
information which is a hubby Hub header

613
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,460
now there was this this long-standing

614
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,100
question about how do you avoid Loops

615
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,559
when you can have topologies within

616
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,020
topologies when you have dotted line

617
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,480
tracks that are joined by segments and

618
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,340
then you have neighbors of two hubs

619
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,380
neighbors how do you ensure that you

620
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,380
don't end up looping looping and to

621
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,740
ensure that the Dow projection draft had

622
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,600
two methods and we refine or added text

623
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,299
to clarify that at the very beginning of

624
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,460
the document there are two things which

625
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,600
must happen

626
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,480
the first thing is kind of classical for

627
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,279
those who participate to to

628
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,380
multi-topology writing efforts in the

629
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,159
past the the the the main thing is the

630
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,860
topology if you can go from topology a

631
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,220
to topology B by say injecting a packet

632
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,559
in an underlay then you can never go

633
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,020
from topology B to topology a again

634
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,539
because you could create a such a path

635
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,159
that you end up looping from one

636
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,799
topology You Go reverse versus the other

637
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,380
topology and you end up looping

638
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,380
so what you can do with something like

639
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,480
that is you can take a package from the

640
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,179
main geodag put it in a truck but then

641
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,559
it has to go all the way to the

642
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,620
destination within that track or an

643
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,120
inner track

644
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,220
which tells you that there must be a

645
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,100
partial order a geodag of tracks if you

646
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,820
like

647
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,120
that there cannot be a loop in the way

648
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,700
the tracks are ordered you can always go

649
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,460
from a certain underlay to a lower

650
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,279
underlay but never to an iron delay

651
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,340
which could which could take you back

652
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,500
so that's the first thing I think this

653
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,440
partial order of underlays now the other

654
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,539
thing that that we have because we have

655
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,460
different methods we have the truck we

656
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,140
have the segments we have the neighbors

657
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,000
we have the two hops Neighbors

658
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,419
is we enforce and that was the text that

659
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,640
whole has started long ago

660
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,299
we enforce a strict preference into

661
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,240
which type of Rod you're using so if you

662
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,179
have a track route a segment route a

663
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,700
two-hub neighbor and a one-hub neighbor

664
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,640
you always favor the one-hub neighbor if

665
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,200
you don't have a one-hub neighbor but

666
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,700
you have a two hop neighbor

667
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,980
then you will use that if if you don't

668
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,659
have that you have a segment you always

669
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,880
use the segment if you don't have a

670
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,380
segment the only thing you have is a

671
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,299
track route then you will use the truck

672
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,520
route and then again this is how we

673
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,340
ensure that we don't Loop

674
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,380
otherwise there was some tags which

675
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,960
looked back to the reader which really

676
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,820
happens when you have this track so this

677
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,279
is this complex complex path if you like

678
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,620
between the source and the destination

679
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,539
and two segments could cross so you go

680
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,700
from this point to this point or this

681
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,620
point to that point but in the middle

682
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,179
there is a same note

683
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,340
so you see which sees the packet with

684
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,260
the same RPI information same topology

685
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,659
should the rod left or down what

686
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,580
segments are you following

687
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,980
and effectively since the the next stop

688
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,140
in the loose Source route is indicated

689
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,580
in the packet this can actually be

690
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,919
resolved so it's not a real problem but

691
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,460
we we clarified how that happens

692
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,340
uh the the last but not least thing that

693
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,399
we clarified is the way the multicast

694
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,100
dough works

695
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,500
the multicast dial is not your usual

696
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,559
though it is like a broadcast

697
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,860
over the radio medium whereby a node can

698
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,260
say hey I'm here here are my IP

699
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,480
addresses if you want to talk to me

700
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,399
don't look at your repo database just

701
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,399
pass me the packet I'm your neighbor

702
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,620
okay so it's just a way to advertise

703
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,380
self as a direct neighbor to the other

704
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,480
guys around

705
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,240
now the the cool thing with the

706
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,419
projection is we have added the concept

707
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,880
of sibling in the dial remember we did

708
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,559
that to provide more topological

709
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,620
information to the root

710
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,760
since we have we in placed our siblings

711
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,159
in the Dao we also have it in the

712
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:18,480
multicast dial

713
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,399
meaning that when I say hey I'm here

714
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,159
I've got a type address I'm also saying

715
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,080
here on here's my list of neighbor and

716
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,580
for the many guys I mean you will

717
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,700
recognize your next uh operating

718
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,399
next operator or something I mean the

719
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,919
you know the guy which is behind your

720
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:35,940
neighbor

721
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,240
and with this you can get to those two

722
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,940
Hub guys without the loop so that's why

723
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,740
we have those four mechanism effectively

724
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,260
in Ripple the track the segment the two

725
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,880
hot neighbors and the one-hub neighbors

726
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,799
the two Hub neighbors are obtained

727
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,559
because we see them as siblings in the

728
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,220
multicast now

729
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,100
and that's pretty much it

730
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,880
um

731
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,059
there there were some typos as always

732
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,100
you know when you push the the draft

733
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,840
when I push the draft and I look at the

734
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,460
GFI fan

735
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,820
so there was a like main which went a

736
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,159
lowercase

737
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,080
um in subtitles I guess it's still there

738
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,119
I would have to fix it that's when our

739
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,940
maintenance that's when I I removed the

740
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,639
uppercase m in main geodag because it

741
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,820
was written uppercase main all the time

742
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,980
and it seemed that the uppercase was not

743
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,020
appropriate so I removed that

744
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,239
and also when I push some text I pushed

745
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,820
it twice with 28 so I removed the the

746
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,740
extra copy in the intro

747
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,379
and that's pretty much it for me okay

748
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,359
thank you very much yes we believe that

749
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,760
the Asus were addresses and the question

750
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,619
is Raul need to confirm the loop

751
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,659
avoidant text

752
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,839
yes and I think I saw Howell's name at

753
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,180
some point so it's just typing in the

754
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,280
chat hello

755
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,220
rollers just typed that he believes the

756
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,200
newly text handles the comments

757
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,619
very good

758
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,900
roll comment for yourself

759
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,160
I can see that the new section

760
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,700
uh essentially goes into details about

761
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,040
stating a lot of things explicitly for

762
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,400
Providence uh and I've already reviewed

763
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,980
section 3.2 and it makes sense to me uh

764
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,800
certainly addresses the comments uh you

765
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,780
know I'm just trying to check whether it

766
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,000
has impact on any other section more or

767
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,619
less I don't you know I don't have any

768
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,540
outstanding comments as of now so thank

769
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,200
you thank you very much

770
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,099
okay great thank you

771
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,660
very much travel

772
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,640
Okay so

773
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,000
then we finished the shepherd rifle

774
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,200
write up and we press the button

775
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,599
okay thank you

776
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,740
sorry but

777
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,040
it's more work for you more work for you

778
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,020
it's not the thinnest thing we've

779
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,500
produced

780
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,619
and I'm happy to work with you again

781
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,500
in the next next way yes

782
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,540
let me follow myself any other comments

783
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,960
in the room about this the projection

784
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,240
while I switched slides yes you need to

785
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,099
skip a good number of backup slides yeah

786
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,960
uh I just

787
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,180
so I left

788
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,119
um in that presentation uh a whole

789
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,300
history of drawings that were presented

790
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,220
during the elaboration of the protocol

791
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,980
so that if you guys for some reason want

792
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,040
to to explain what the projection is you

793
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,560
can dig those slides and and get them

794
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,560
foreign

795
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,320
so the the other thing I wanted to to

796
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,240
present to you guys today

797
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,420
is work which is happening at six low

798
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,780
for now but which impacts uh Ripple and

799
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,339
raw as well

800
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:16,760
and what it's doing is extending RFC

801
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,700
9010 which is a ripple unaware leaf

802
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,700
for different types of addresses so the

803
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,339
first draft that you're probably all

804
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:29,940
aware of is the one that avoids using

805
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,000
MLD in an lln as you know mlds like

806
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,920
traditional ND it's using a lot of

807
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,619
multicast unless you know multicast is

808
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,800
on for when you want to preserve energy

809
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,480
so or broadcast really so the same way

810
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,140
that we can avoid Broadcasting

811
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,700
uh nsna message is using a six slope nnd

812
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,260
we can also get rid of the multicast in

813
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,160
MLD the the report Thing by proactively

814
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,079
installing the multicast and any cast

815
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,839
addresses the same way we installed the

816
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:09,720
unicast addresses using six slope and ND

817
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,260
so using rfch 505 so what we are doing

818
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,260
here is extending the work that we have

819
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,700
with our fc8505 and RFC 9010 to

820
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,579
multicast and any cast address

821
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:27,599
now as if that was not enough there is a

822
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
new piece of work

823
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,820
where we want to redistribute into

824
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,880
Ripple external destinations which are

825
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,460
not necessarily hosts but can also be

826
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,420
prefixes so how can you inject in repo a

827
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,099
step prefix

828
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,280
we certainly did not want a ripple

829
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,900
Network or did not expect a report

830
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,300
Network to be a Transit Network

831
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,540
but we've always thought that the Ripple

832
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,040
Network could be connecting steps

833
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,640
but what we didn't have is a way to

834
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,400
install stubs into repo by a node which

835
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,920
does not support Ripple so what we can

836
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,680
do with hosts injecting their addresses

837
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,780
with six slope and ND you know protocol

838
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,240
abstract fashion we didn't have for

839
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,599
prefixes so that's why we are now having

840
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,380
this new prefix registration extension

841
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,800
that allows a node which

842
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,400
is Ripple unaware to talk to a ripple

843
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,440
router and say hey I have this step

844
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,920
prefix please inject it in repo

845
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,830
next slide please

846
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,079
[Music]

847
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,940
and by the way I will be presenting that

848
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,740
at six flow and That Snack as well

849
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,680
because it kind of solves uh some snack

850
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,020
scenarios as well so now that the six

851
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,839
slope and ND it starts to be a a an

852
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,619
interesting family so we started with

853
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,619
6775 which was the well the starting

854
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,839
point and and working on it and

855
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,640
deploying it we found that the number of

856
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,400
issues so we ended up solving them and

857
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,540
8505 is the second and I'll say final

858
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,940
version of the address registration

859
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,940
mechanism in ND

860
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,480
um then we produced 8928 to secure that

861
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,520
so that gives you something like sound

862
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,440
but probably better because sand is

863
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,079
limited in the size of the cryptographic

864
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,780
token at 928 is not

865
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,680
and we probably are provided

866
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,339
8929 which is the first time uh the

867
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,680
aware and address that is registered

868
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,680
through 855 is effectively redistributed

869
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,780
somewhere in this case it was

870
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,220
redistributed in uh in ND itself so it's

871
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,920
basically a host using 8505 to talk for

872
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,200
instance to an access point and asking

873
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,060
the access point to do proxy and D for

874
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,960
the host and the proxy can be bridged

875
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,599
that would what happened with Wi-Fi

876
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,400
because the MAC address are breachable

877
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,339
in which case the the basically the

878
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,500
router would defend the AP being a

879
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,140
router would defend the address of the

880
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,420
stay using the MAC address of the stay

881
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,760
so the packets will be bridged directly

882
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,619
to the stay by the access point

883
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:19,560
or it could be a rotting bridge in which

884
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,560
case on the ethernet backbone the router

885
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,780
again exiting as access point would

886
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,780
present its own IP address well it would

887
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,460
present its own Mac address for the IP

888
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,200
address of the state meaning that the

889
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,820
MAC address of the state would not be

890
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,060
visible on the ethernet fabric the cool

891
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,920
thing about that is is the layer 2 is

892
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,260
becomes very very stable

893
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,140
so that's the the rotting proxy in that

894
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,079
case uh you can have devices which are

895
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,420
not only brigidable breachable Max like

896
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,680
Wi-Fi but also non-bridgeable Max like

897
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,880
a22.154 so that's that's what it was

898
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,560
designed for

899
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,660
so that's it nine to nine and since then

900
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,940
we have redistributed six open ND in a

901
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,800
number of protocols so that there is

902
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,520
rift there is Ripple with uh nine zero

903
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,020
one zero

904
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,119
um there is a draft for ivpn I mean as

905
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,560
soon as you have the information that

906
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,040
the the IP address is there and with H5

907
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,800
the host can signal a please write to me

908
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,380
then the router doing any protocol can

909
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,240
inject that IP address inside that

910
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,640
protocol but like like I said it was for

911
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,820
only for IP unicast address now the six

912
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,700
load multicast registration allows the

913
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,920
host to proactively say hey I'm

914
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,359
listening to this multi-cast address

915
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,839
please inject it in Ripple as well or if

916
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,280
you're using meeple or something else

917
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,420
then it's going to be meeple or

918
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,560
something else

919
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,900
so so basically multicast registration

920
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,960
adds any cast and multicast ripple

921
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,880
storing mode as a native support of

922
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,740
multicast we added something for

923
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,700
non-storring mode which is basically

924
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,680
replication at the root and tunneling to

925
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,960
the device

926
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,940
uh unicast look up David asking somebody

927
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,319
it's a Munich

928
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,480
okay

929
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,680
yeah David

930
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,400
David come on yeah

931
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,079
um David lumpater

932
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,420
um so I just wanted to note that the

933
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,240
Wi-Fi setups when they are bridgeable

934
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,339
they are not actually mesh networks so

935
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,560
you cannot have a bridgeable Wi-Fi mesh

936
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,000
setup so those are

937
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,940
different types of 80211 operation so

938
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,079
I'm not sure

939
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,180
okay yeah the

940
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,900
well once you reach the router yes

941
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,359
effectively if you have a layer to mesh

942
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,300
we don't really see it right so so we

943
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,579
just see the MAC address of the

944
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,880
destination uh if if we want and that's

945
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,400
what we do with Ripple uh we'll be at

946
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,660
the mesh at layer three and that's what

947
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,579
we call rot over so there is the the

948
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:51,960
mesh under

949
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,900
which is what

950
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,680
802.11 s would have been doing and then

951
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,240
there is the right over which is what

952
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,040
triple would be doing and we could

953
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,839
effectively do Ripple over Wi-Fi if we

954
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,180
wanted to over 15 4 which is a very

955
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,839
classical thing

956
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,480
[Music]

957
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,420
um

958
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,220
and then there is this new work I just

959
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,079
hinted which is the prefix registration

960
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,000
and I will come back on that a bit later

961
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,660
next slide please

962
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,180
10 minutes

963
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,819
so multicast registration you as you

964
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,220
know it's being expected by the wise and

965
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,220
Alliance it's covering their needs

966
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,780
uh so we we move quickly on it and we

967
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,480
get support from why some people at the

968
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,040
same time

969
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,380
we have beefed up the update rsc6515

970
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,319
quite a bit so we explained uh things

971
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,380
like how we use the the Rover and the

972
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,760
lifetime when you get the same

973
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,980
information from multiple listeners of

974
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,900
the same multicast address how do you

975
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,800
merge uh the rod ownership verifier and

976
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,800
the OU which lifetime you pick

977
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,040
um we talked about freshness unless you

978
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,200
know the freshness is what allows you to

979
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,819
detect to to Route when there is

980
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,920
movement so when there is movement the

981
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,560
host indicates in six open NDS sequence

982
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,940
counter so you know the most the

983
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,660
freshest location that's 9010

984
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,660
and the the Ripple carries that sequence

985
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,579
and only retains the rods which has the

986
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,020
freshest sequence and that's basically

987
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,359
the way when they protocols work and

988
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,859
ripple is just designed the same way

989
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,960
um when you have multiple listeners

990
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,240
listening to the same multicaster drives

991
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,980
you cannot compare the freshness

992
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,800
information from that different sources

993
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,460
but if you know the different uh that

994
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,380
will come from the same

995
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,560
Source through different paths then you

996
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,000
can still compare and that's what we

997
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,700
explain so the Rover basically indicates

998
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,579
what the source is and as long as you

999
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:05,520
can you see different dialcomings from

1000
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,960
different from the same Source you can

1001
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,339
still compare the lifetime other one

1002
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,180
otherwise you can't

1003
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,460
um the sequence counter I'm sorry

1004
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,480
and and we have these

1005
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,460
this something we want to in Ng messages

1006
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,660
array and others

1007
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,099
and

1008
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,460
we have we had that open question with

1009
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,180
six men basically should we export that

1010
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,000
option outside of this specification or

1011
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
keep it in there and they recline at the

1012
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,040
the point and they have not seen really

1013
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,380
a definitive answer so for now it's

1014
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,200
still it's still in this document

1015
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,480
basically the goal here is when you

1016
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,119
register something to your router you

1017
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,920
want to know if the router has rebooted

1018
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,780
and has lost the state that you have

1019
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,339
registered to it

1020
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,619
and it's true along the Ripple path if

1021
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,300
your parent reboots you want to know so

1022
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,520
you need to send your dials again

1023
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,180
next line

1024
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,700
so the probably the most meaningful

1025
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,300
meaningful change that happened is there

1026
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,480
were two bits in the the error option

1027
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,780
and then the message is the dark message

1028
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,960
and the repo Target option message which

1029
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,300
would indicate well if the bits are zero

1030
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,760
then it's a unicast address if the first

1031
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,920
bit is arms multicast it can be designed

1032
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,740
it's any cast and if we do that we we

1033
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,599
have this value 3 which is kind of

1034
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,660
unassigned and wasted but since now we

1035
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,540
want to register prefixes why waste this

1036
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,040
value so instead of saying it's two

1037
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,480
flags we turned it into it's a two-bit

1038
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,180
field which we call the P field as

1039
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,180
opposed to the a foreign

1040
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,040
Flags we turn that into a two-bit field

1041
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,560
so we can use the value 3 and we'll use

1042
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,440
it in the other specs of prefixes so now

1043
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,540
in this P flag that you can find in

1044
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,000
Arrow in Dar an inertia

1045
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,920
if it's zero it's a unique asset address

1046
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,079
if it's one it's a multicast address if

1047
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,700
it's two it's in any Caster trash if

1048
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,460
it's three it's a prefix

1049
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,520
next slide oh by the way in this

1050
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,859
particular slot if a document the

1051
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:20,220
multicast we say unassigned and it's the

1052
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,720
other document which is the prefix

1053
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,480
registration which reassigns it now this

1054
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,540
is extra burden for the Ina so if if

1055
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,240
uh that you know we we adopt the

1056
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,359
document maybe we uh we could assign

1057
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,220
everything there and avoid having a Yana

1058
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,740
registration registry for for just the P

1059
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,599
field

1060
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,040
admin and try to converge okay so yes so

1061
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,740
please go down

1062
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,640
okay so that's the other draft as we uh

1063
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,619
yes we need to previous slide action

1064
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,140
because that's intro for us okay

1065
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:59,460
um so this is RFC 9010

1066
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,500
and what it allows

1067
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,780
is me to take the mic

1068
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,420
it allows a device that doesn't speak

1069
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,260
Ripple to register through rfc8505

1070
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,740
proven by rfc8928

1071
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,200
an address to a router which is Ripple

1072
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,940
router and the Ripple router will

1073
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,280
redistribute will inject that route that

1074
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,520
host route into the Ripple domain okay

1075
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,040
we can do it for host the protocol is

1076
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,859
six dependent D it is independent of the

1077
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,380
routing protocol that happens above we

1078
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,260
have these for addresses next slide

1079
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,060
please let me

1080
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,339
and now what we want to do with the new

1081
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,680
uh prefix registration is to do the same

1082
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,200
thing for external destinations which

1083
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,900
happen to be not rods or host rods but

1084
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,280
prefix rods steps

1085
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,119
so so so if you're doing normal repo you

1086
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,160
can always inject prefixes Ripple is not

1087
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,260
just for host addresses it is a routing

1088
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,640
protocol it's a classical distance

1089
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,040
Vector protocol just happens to be an

1090
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,000
isotropic but we can only use Ripple to

1091
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,520
advertise prefixes if we have next slide

1092
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,480
please

1093
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,720
if we have a non-repo device which

1094
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,540
happens to own a prefix say it connects

1095
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,660
to a step or it's even a prefix which is

1096
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,079
inside that device well six slip and ND

1097
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,020
does not allow the device to tell the

1098
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,300
Ripple router so the Ripple router can

1099
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,920
redistribute that next slide

1100
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,119
so that's pretty much what we're going

1101
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,579
to to add

1102
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:38,099
allowing x505 to register prefixes now

1103
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:39,960
if we register prefixes the main

1104
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,660
question is hey

1105
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,420
one of the roles of Six Flag ND is to

1106
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,800
ensure that the address is not a

1107
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,599
duplicate you have a return code to say

1108
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,280
hey this address already exists in my

1109
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,400
network what happens with prefixes

1110
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,520
well with prefixes instead of managing

1111
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,099
exact match we will have to have some

1112
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,460
policies to say hey this prefix can be

1113
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,680
obtained by this guy because it's within

1114
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,660
a larger aggregation which we own or

1115
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,800
something like that

1116
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,839
so we'll have to have some policies

1117
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,960
which replace that that is an exact

1118
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,740
match of the full address

1119
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,559
wants to auto-conf a prefix or claim a

1120
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,599
prefix we will have to check that it's a

1121
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,880
load to claim that prefix and there will

1122
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,640
be policies but that would eventually

1123
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,740
allow a device to Auto confer prefix

1124
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,720
just like we're talking for addresses

1125
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,240
next slide

1126
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,000
how that would work well same thing as

1127
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,040
for roast address but it would be for a

1128
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,559
prefix the the device down there would

1129
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,140
claim a prefix through six level ND and

1130
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,880
the rather the first Super rata will

1131
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,740
inject that in Ripple

1132
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,740
now a question that is to be discussed

1133
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,839
with the group is should we still use NS

1134
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,059
with the error option in there or should

1135
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,339
we call that an errors should that be an

1136
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:58,740
RS array as opposed to an nsna or

1137
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,780
anything else because I'm getting a lot

1138
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,420
of trouble just because we are using NS

1139
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,180
for the registration so freely we need

1140
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,220
to invent a new message when that's

1141
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,300
still possible

1142
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,160
next slide

1143
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,040
and as I uh interview we are extending

1144
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,500
the P field so now the value 1 1 are

1145
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,480
supposed to be a what is that when these

1146
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,619
are two flags

1147
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:22,740
uh now it really means registration for

1148
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,319
a prefix next slide

1149
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,300
and there is basically the flow that you

1150
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,720
would get with RSC uh eight nine uh to

1151
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,660
eight so you send a host Auto

1152
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,420
configuration address on our prefix

1153
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,440
it's it would send an NS with the arrow

1154
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,140
if the Rover is a crypto ID it would be

1155
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,000
challenged for ownership of that ID so

1156
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,339
the crypto weapons and if effectively

1157
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,020
the host can prove ownership of the

1158
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:52,800
Rover then the DNA will be accepted

1159
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,220
so the big challenge is the arrow is now

1160
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,960
a step registration meaning that the

1161
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,940
target that's being advertised is

1162
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,440
effectively a prefix so you have a

1163
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,420
prefix lengths in the error option

1164
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,859
next slide

1165
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:07,140
another tons of things we could be doing

1166
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,819
but I'm short

1167
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,460
yeah so it was mostly to to tell you

1168
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,319
guys that this is happening

1169
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,260
and the hope is effectively that we have

1170
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,520
a

1171
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,440
protocol Independence something which is

1172
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,660
completely not dependent on Ripple which

1173
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,940
allows a device to advertise the prefix

1174
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,099
that triple will redistribute

1175
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:29,760
and then the diagram I want to see the

1176
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,800
previous yeah so what is the destination

1177
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,079
of our address of NS that you are

1178
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,960
replacing with uh in this message is the

1179
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,760
router it's a unicast between the host

1180
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,380
and the router

1181
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,900
so the destination this nation is the

1182
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,119
the link local choice of the router okay

1183
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,220
any questions I go home

1184
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,419
that's for me

1185
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:05,400
uh just for the chairs can you please uh

1186
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,819
track that draft yeah just like you're

1187
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:10,559
tracking the multicast one and make sure

1188
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,940
that you know there's coordination with

1189
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,180
six low yeah yes they are family

1190
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:26,160
thank you very much

1191
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,960
do we have reviewers for this document

1192
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:33,240
no do we have reviewers for the coming

1193
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,119
and someone want to review

1194
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,640
asking for volunteers to review within

1195
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,118
the road working

1196
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,000
okay maybe we can think to the many list

1197
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,559
uh

1198
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,040
it's like

1199
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,740
the next slide should be like the open

1200
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,760
floor so from the last meeting we have

1201
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,460
an action point for future works like

1202
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,339
how do we do Management in Ripple

1203
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:05,040
so that is something that we need to

1204
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,559
start working on

1205
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,660
something to think as well and research

1206
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,500
or not on this

1207
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:15,859
additional comments

1208
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,819
well so this is an open floor any uh

1209
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,400
comments from the group you know is what

1210
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,099
we should be doing as I said at the

1211
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,680
beginning we want to ship a few

1212
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,319
documents that are in our way and have

1213
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,720
been sitting for a long time and then we

1214
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,059
can open

1215
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:39,000
uh open up new I have news for work so

1216
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,099
as uh in this mentioned we want to

1217
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:44,280
address the management issue of Ripple

1218
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,240
routers we also one thing that we've

1219
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,180
been considering for a while is uh

1220
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,700
putting together the Ripple V2

1221
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,680
specification so uh

1222
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,240
uh pruning

1223
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,720
some stuff that is not used and nobody

1224
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,839
seems to be interested in and merging in

1225
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,500
the various options various additions

1226
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,720
extensions that we've produced over the

1227
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,800
last

1228
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,650
10 years

1229
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,480
[Music]

1230
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,300
and so any comments on that any other

1231
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,079
stuff that we've you think we should not

1232
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,740
be missing

1233
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,859
and

1234
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,980
no comments

1235
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,800
yeah

1236
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,500
for those who care

1237
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,359
I made the exercise of turning the

1238
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:46,079
original Ripple specification 6550

1239
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,800
in XML V3 so that was not a small

1240
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Endeavor but but I I made it so if you

1241
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,980
want to see the original Ripple uh

1242
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:01,859
formatted like XML to RFC V3 can do it's

1243
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:03,420
effectively available the draft is

1244
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,220
expired but it's been published so there

1245
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,980
is effectively if in the Raw you know

1246
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,819
Library uh Ripple V2 if you like draft

1247
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:15,300
under my name which is for version zero

1248
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,660
zero the exact copy of the RFC

1249
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:24,480
but in XML to our FC V2 this way

1250
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,540
right thank you for that effort has come

1251
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,240
and actually I want to mention that you

1252
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,059
already started but you know should go

1253
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:37,800
into uh Ripple V2 the 55 65 50 best

1254
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,460
draft which we need to revive as well

1255
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,000
okay

1256
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,859
right okay

1257
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,900
[Music]

1258
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,099
anything else from the floor

1259
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,680
is

1260
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,920
hand okay start about the Ripple

1261
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,220
protocol I just want to

1262
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,380
clarify the terminologies because this

1263
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,400
group is using the lln nodes and the six

1264
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,099
slope and ND they are calling the six

1265
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:24,619
low nodes and another RFC by the I think

1266
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:28,800
Bremen Kristen Bremen from Germany he

1267
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,619
wrote that constrained nodes so I

1268
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,660
discussed with him can you speak closer

1269
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,260
please so should I repeat again I think

1270
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,980
in this group or the RPL so they are

1271
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,520
calling the nodes like 11 nodes and in

1272
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,559
the six Law Group they are calling the

1273
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,460
six load nodes

1274
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,740
they are calling the constant nodes so

1275
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,280
why not we call this whole stack that

1276
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,180
having these protocols like RPL 6.5 and

1277
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,900
D6 low band uh like we we call the nurse

1278
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,020
like six load then categorize uh later

1279
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,220
into 6lr or 6 lbr

1280
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,960
so this is just a comment okay

1281
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,420
yeah thank you for the suggestion that

1282
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:27,480
we harmonize a notation between the

1283
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,660
various groups uh there yeah jumping

1284
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,059
they are not actually quite the same but

1285
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:36,180
we can make an effort in that way yes

1286
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,420
the point is 6lm is a logical function

1287
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,940
s not really a physical node

1288
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,559
so

1289
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,720
agree foreign no this is very vague

1290
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,099
because when we started this we didn't

1291
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:52,020
have the 70 to 28 it came after but for

1292
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,780
the six island thing that really means a

1293
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:58,500
node which can play RFC 8505

1294
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,140
right so so it's a logical function a

1295
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,900
repo rudder

1296
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,180
um Can effectively is expected to be a

1297
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,520
six letter and it's probably a 6lr as

1298
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,079
well

1299
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,180
um but it's a logical function so doing

1300
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,339
ripple doing six up ND these are logical

1301
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:16,319
function in the same node so it's not

1302
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,660
written type of node

1303
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,140
the point is if xln is a constraint node

1304
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,640
or no

1305
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,940
according to be I mean it's it's just a

1306
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,700
node that's about six slip and ND we

1307
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,819
want to to extend the range of

1308
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:36,980
application of 8505 to any device

1309
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,280
you like they will still be six elements

1310
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,020
because they speak at 505.

1311
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,980
thank you

1312
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,079
we've reached the top of the r and the

1313
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:58,040
last minute comment

1314
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,619
then meetings adjourned thank you very

1315
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:03,660
much

1316
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,618
let's carry on

1317
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:11,040
virtual interim okay let's

1318
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,160
let's plan for that so we can have a

1319
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,319
more time give us more time for Focus

1320
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,920
discussions

1321
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,240
okay

1322
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,980
done thank you

1323
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,700
thank you

1324
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,280
thank you very much for me

1325
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,240
my pleasure to meet you

1326
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,200
so you know okay let's wait

1327
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,020
does it stay on or do you turn this off

1328
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:05,480
or I mean it's a recording isn't it

1329
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,660
okay

1330
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,440
I don't know
