1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,860
yes

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,299
okay

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,400
good afternoon

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,220
uh

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,900
John do you hear me John cleansing

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,559
and Todd

7
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,040
yes I hear you okay fine

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,559
all right okay let's get started as uh

9
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,940
um

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,760
this is email core in preparation for

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,280
this section uh I think she has realized

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,739
that we probably can use couple of hours

13
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,140
we only have one

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,899
um we'll try to do as much work as we

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,680
can

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,199
certain issues if we are making progress

17
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,960
we might spend a bit more time on them

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,820
and then we'll take the rest to the

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,979
mailing list

20
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,420
um

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,700
John cleansing suggested that we might

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,439
want to do an interim

23
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
in you know

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
next month or so I think I put you know

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,580
obviously we need to agree whether this

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,740
is a good idea but this sounds like a

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,080
reasonable thing to me

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,979
um and let's get started

29
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,580
okay

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,700
you should all be familiar with node

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,320
well

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,559
foreign

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,360
be nice to each other

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,979
uh

35
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,399
we kind of have a note taker

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,880
for part of the meeting but uh thank you

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,820
Ken but if we get to the applicability

38
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,500
statement somebody will need to take

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,659
notes then

40
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,380
can somebody

41
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,739
yes please log in into metako if you can

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,620
um

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,959
if you are in the room please use masks

44
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,520
unless you're presenting at the mic

45
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,379
so

46
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,360
um

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,220
there is quite a lot of stuff on the

48
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,620
agenda uh I probably not going to ask to

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,900
rejiggle stuff because we'll just deal

50
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,140
with whatever we have in the slides

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,340
um

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,040
can I have a show of hands who read the

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,519
slides

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,140
hey that's

55
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,220
I'm I'm I'm basically shooting lasers

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,160
out of my my eyes now

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,980
okay well

58
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,940
we'll do our best

59
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,260
okay

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,400
so

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
um very quickly

62
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,599
um Pete posted a new version of 53 22

63
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,099
bits

64
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,159
he did a change in response to rata

65
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,400
about obsolete time zones

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,499
[Applause]

67
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,040
nobody commented on the mailing list if

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,920
people have any objections to this

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,659
please send your comments on the mailing

70
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,519
list I'm just trying to alert people to

71
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,560
this change I think it's very reasonable

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,739
personally but obviously if you disagree

73
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,480
then

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,560
lab chairs now

75
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,840
um

76
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,019
can you just take a notes in your

77
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,720
favorite editor that's fine

78
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,459
so

79
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,659
the next thing is we are going to talk

80
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,239
about various issues related to the

81
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,280
trace header field

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,780
and

83
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,620
it will talk this is Pete

84
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,880
hello hello

85
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:27,960
so the the issue comes down to there's a

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,020
there are definitions for Trace

87
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,060
that occur in both 5321 and 5322 and

88
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,220
let's be clear there are three different

89
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,620
things we're talking about there are

90
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,080
things that are named slightly

91
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,500
differently Trace in the ABN f

92
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,080
there are things that different

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,460
documents call Trace headers

94
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,520
like an adjective and then there are

95
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,740
things that get stuck on top of messages

96
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,780
as they're going through transport and

97
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,220
other systems

98
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,000
and those may or may not be Trace so

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,979
that that's sort of the setup for what's

100
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,080
going on here

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,280
um

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,000
so 5322 currently defines a very general

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,120
Syntax for their seed field

104
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,400
and points to 5321 and says go see there

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,240
for what the exact syntax is and

106
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,259
um

107
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,979
and and stops and then 5321 has a much

108
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,039
more restrictive syntax okay sorry

109
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
you're kind of jumping a little bit I

110
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,199
did

111
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,780
so I think you want this slide okay

112
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,820
that's this is the comparison slide

113
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,120
between two syntaxes now one thing about

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,940
the 5322 syntax which was mentioned on

115
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,020
the list is it's really General so you

116
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,600
could generate from it things that

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,840
definitely do not conform to 5321 in any

118
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,100
way shape or form including particularly

119
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,860
things that have one of those receive

120
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,840
tokens and not a pair so you could come

121
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,880
up with an odd number which is

122
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,800
definitely what button in 5321

123
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,520
um

124
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,120
but it does limit the syntax somewhat

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,160
and so the question is

126
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
is that limit well we can go on to the

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,139
next slide and you can see what the

128
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,000
differences here are

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,100
um but go on to the next slide

130
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
so

131
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,199
we've got this issue 74.

132
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,400
um

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,340
there's the 5321 question about whether

134
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,220
the attributes are ordered the way they

135
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,199
are currently specified in the a b and F

136
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,180
we've got the 5322 question about

137
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,100
whether we need to be more specific and

138
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,240
make it pairs in the ABN F or make it

139
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,340
even more General and make it just

140
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,380
unstructured stuff and the definition is

141
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,300
elsewhere

142
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,220
and

143
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,699
or possibly should there just be one a b

144
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,860
and F definition and then the other

145
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,180
document likely 5322 says go look there

146
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,680
for the definition we don't even bother

147
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,319
specifying it here

148
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,720
um so

149
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,060
here are some possible choices

150
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,520
just to give you lots of fun so number

151
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,520
one is exactly what 5322 does at the

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,039
moment which is one star receive token

153
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,740
receive token includes word which

154
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,599
includes Adam which allows you to do

155
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,759
atom followed by the value atom followed

156
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,639
by the value atom followed by value

157
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,639
um but allows for an odd number of them

158
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,680
number two

159
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,440
makes the atom explicit

160
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,900
So Adam received token one or more of

161
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,800
those

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
okay and just a quick clarification the

163
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
uh you know it's typically atom include

164
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
Ford white um comments so there are

165
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,240
spaces automatically between tokens so

166
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,460
don't be alerted

167
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,979
yeah it's kind of the way the gram is

168
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,440
written which is also slightly curious

169
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,620
but yeah just the way it is okay number

170
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,539
three

171
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,060
is

172
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,139
um

173
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,660
the same as number one so no change to

174
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,460
the syntax but put a comment in

175
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,060
specifically pointing over to the 53 21

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,400
I think it should say syntax

177
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,099
that was a typo sorry about that

178
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,260
number four yes sorry is

179
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,760
um basically move the 5321 syntax

180
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,039
entirely into 5322

181
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,880
um

182
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,100
well okay that wasn't quite what I

183
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
intended what I intended is

184
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,279
well move a copy and because opt info

185
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,740
includes all the extension Fields then

186
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,920
basically extensibility is explicit this

187
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,260
way right but this is putting more of

188
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,779
the syntax into 5322 that is currently

189
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,040
there it's being more specific correct

190
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,320
and number five is combine two and three

191
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,940
make the syntax change and add a comment

192
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,740
number six is give up and say received

193
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,240
colon unstructured and then point to uh

194
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,480
5321. put a comment in that says it's

195
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,580
all their problem over there not ours

196
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,360
do we have another slide or is that it

197
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,959
uh

198
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,240
well no that's the next issue that's the

199
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,940
next issue so the question on the table

200
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,480
is

201
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,740
what if anything do we want to do here

202
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
I could give you this editor's opinion

203
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
but I'd rather hear from you all

204
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,779
than make the decision

205
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,399
it seems that some chap named Alexi is

206
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,580
in the queue okay let me actually uh be

207
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,519
late in the queue and John John John yes

208
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
John Levine is on top of the queue front

209
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,550
of the queue

210
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,240
[Music]

211
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,660
uh

212
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,279
um

213
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,019
I think we should give up and do number

214
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,019
six because my experience which I've

215
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,540
been you know which is just mine is that

216
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,220
received headers fall into two general

217
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,200
categories one is people who read the

218
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,320
spec and they match 5321 pretty well and

219
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,540
the other is organizations such as those

220
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,279
in Redmond Washington they put in random

221
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,120
crap

222
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,240
and if we want to describe reality six

223
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,279
is basically it I mean if we want to

224
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,440
encourage people to to follow the rules

225
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,540
we can but after 50 years I think

226
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,380
they're going to do what they do

227
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,880
interesting

228
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,560
okay John cleansing

229
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,399
another argument for six

230
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,140
is that if we're seeing fields are

231
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,620
inserted by not SMTP transports

232
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,600
there is no guarantee that they are

233
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,260
going to use the stuff semicolon date

234
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,120
time syntax

235
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,800
that we're now specifying in both

236
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,019
documents

237
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,800
um and and not only the semicolon date

238
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,860
time but the precise date time version

239
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,899
that we're specifying in both documents

240
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,959
which is inconsistent with date times

241
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
these are being specified elsewhere like

242
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,060
in sedation this is like that

243
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,000
um and that's again a strong argument

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,540
for

245
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,360
for number six I think

246
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,399
um I have very mixed feelings about all

247
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,680
of this which really complicates place

248
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,279
nice

249
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,100
okay uh speak uh we have minor technical

250
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,079
difficulties because projectors say it's

251
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,600
about to turn off uh and we need to

252
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,820
click something to we don't know how to

253
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,959
do

254
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,820
um

255
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,519
no probably not it but

256
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,079
in the meantime

257
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,100
um

258
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,560
speaking as a participant

259
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,079
I think I prefer option two

260
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,839
[Music]

261
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
um

262
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,000
ah realistically technical people

263
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,899
excellent

264
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,019
all registered uh

265
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,620
attributes have values

266
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,740
I think probably not having this is

267
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,620
going to break some stuff maybe uh um

268
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,860
as a possible thing to help us out if we

269
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,620
decide to investigate this uh I can

270
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,940
probably write a parsa and run you know

271
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,660
digest a big mailing list and see if

272
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,940
existing received headers satisfy the

273
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,220
pair requirements if I get any errors

274
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,779
but obviously I cannot do this

275
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,740
information on the spot

276
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,160
you can

277
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,399
yeah this is canceled my preference

278
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,060
would be just to reference 5321 but that

279
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,560
may not be

280
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
realistic but I just wanted to voice

281
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
that opinion oh it just reference and oh

282
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
and not even do number six do nothing in

283
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,860
22 and just point to 21.

284
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,440
happened to find in one place but again

285
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,480
may not be realistic

286
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,399
I think this is more like number three

287
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,540
than

288
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,300
no no he's saying you want to actually

289
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,779
remove the entire section yeah

290
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,279
okay

291
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,079
so

292
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,060
um

293
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,980
speaking for myself

294
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,100
um uh one and three are my personal

295
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,120
favorites only because

296
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,959
my gut has always been least change I

297
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,899
would hate for us to change something in

298
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,779
this document and have it screw up some

299
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,240
implementation down the road that

300
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,120
attempts to change things

301
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,380
um I think we all agree that whatever

302
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,940
5321 produces is going to fit into uh

303
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,500
uh

304
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,380
Choice One or three is the three three

305
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,660
is one with a comment

306
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,519
um and I'm afraid that choice six will

307
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,160
encourage behavior that will turn out

308
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,760
badly

309
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,620
but that is speaking just as a

310
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,139
participant I will take direction of the

311
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,040
group

312
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,040
obviously

313
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,279
okay actually John

314
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,699
oh

315
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,040
Johnson oh there you are

316
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,660
um

317
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,120
yeah sorry can you clear up my concern a

318
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,380
little bit before you walk away from the

319
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,440
mic to me if we do something which looks

320
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,740
more restrictive than the current text

321
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,839
looks as this thing for me is then I

322
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,820
fully agree with your concern

323
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,740
but if we put something in there which

324
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,240
says

325
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,639
um

326
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,839
completely unstructured as far as this

327
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,060
document is concerned goes to the other

328
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,260
document if you're looking for some

329
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,880
additional syntax which is what six does

330
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,880
or an appropriate paragraph which says

331
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,440
this stuff is really covered by the

332
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,839
density go look at

333
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:43,920
um

334
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,000
uh 5321 bits which is what Ken suggest

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
and what I suggested some months some

336
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
weeks earlier then I don't think there's

337
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,360
a problem with somebody looking at it

338
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,339
and saying aha this has become more

339
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,380
restrictive we have to run off and start

340
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,440
rejecting valid Fields uh and indeed

341
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,820
that's my concern about even leaving the

342
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,680
semicolon date time again because if

343
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,660
you're worried about people rejecting

344
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,660
ballot Fields then the validity of that

345
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,660
field becomes an issue where things

346
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,100
which we would consider perfectly

347
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,600
reasonable don't fail the test

348
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,740
something like they wouldn't have a date

349
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,540
time or something like that

350
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,000
well at the moment I am more worried

351
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,139
about

352
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,279
somebody you something using an ISO date

353
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,060
or a sedate day time rather than a 5322

354
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,660
date time

355
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,639
but yeah somebody might might decide

356
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,019
they're putting in a time stamp without

357
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,360
a time is rational

358
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,160
well so here's here's my concern John

359
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,620
if there is Legacy code out there

360
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,440
expecting

361
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,500
a 53-22 date time

362
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,199
and we loosen this structure

363
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,859
then what you've done is

364
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,140
increase the likelihood that some piece

365
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,140
of code is going to blow up

366
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,679
by saying completely unstructured

367
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,720
and maybe we think the chances of that

368
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,720
are low but the the you know the whole

369
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
principle here was moving to full

370
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,140
standard and my gut is that that means

371
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,199
don't change things that we haven't seen

372
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,720
as currently causing a problem it causes

373
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,220
a problem in terms of the agreement of

374
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,080
the documents and making sure that the

375
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,720
documents work together but if we don't

376
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,059
change the syntax in any particular way

377
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,360
now between the documents we leave them

378
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,679
as they were in 5322 and 5321

379
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,280
that seems less likely to cause harm

380
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,640
even though I I mean you know I agree

381
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,679
there there's something

382
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,780
um very attractive about sex there's

383
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,640
something very attractive about too as

384
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,039
far as I'm concerned

385
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,039
uh and and and and and to me there's

386
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,780
something very attractive about five

387
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,080
just to be comprehensive about this

388
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,179
yep I I again I I am leaning on least

389
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,980
change

390
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,520
I I understand that and my difficulty is

391
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,960
that I am

392
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,380
having trouble figuring out why if what

393
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,860
we're worried about here is

394
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,380
rejection from some

395
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,640
specials from some of this code that

396
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,380
follow the specification carefully

397
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,400
earlier

398
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,820
and and now we relax the rules

399
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,919
and they get confused and start

400
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,720
rejecting things which they would have

401
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,720
accepted before no no no no the opposite

402
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
the opposite I what I'm worried about is

403
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,900
we've got something as As an interpreter

404
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,500
as a reader of messages that conforms to

405
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,059
the current rules

406
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:05,700
and now we have a piece of software that

407
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,980
because we relax the rules starts

408
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,860
generating lots and lots of

409
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,440
messages that do not conform to the old

410
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,860
rules and now we have increased

411
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,140
likelihood that those messages will get

412
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,020
through to things that will be broken

413
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,200
and and and and that then gets back to

414
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
the who's defining a trace field and

415
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,240
who's put who's defining what is a trace

416
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,760
field more generally the receipts and

417
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,679
who gets to put them in

418
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,740
and if the answer is that who gets to

419
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,840
put the put receipt kills particularly

420
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,299
in is an MTA then

421
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,620
your third category is in trouble

422
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,520
regardless because it needs to be

423
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,520
following 5321 even under the existing

424
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,919
text in 53. 51 53 21 53 21 wrists even

425
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,919
under the existing tests 5322.

426
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,140
and so again

427
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,679
if if you're if the concern is the

428
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,780
putting in six

429
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,240
would make this less restrictive and

430
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,880
therefore cause problems I don't see it

431
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
if if the purpose of having this stuff

432
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,980
in 5322 at all is to uh is to Define and

433
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,740
accept syntax in a parsing Syntax for

434
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,360
something which your text already says

435
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,200
they're not supposed to pay any

436
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,059
attention to Sprint yourself

437
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,440
so

438
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,380
I I don't know where to go here but I

439
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,000
think that last makes an argument either

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,640
for six or or preferably for Kansas

441
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,299
suggestion

442
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,059
so

443
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,039
uh rather than have the two document

444
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,780
authors up here going back and forth

445
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,640
does anybody else

446
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,400
want to see if they can unlock this

447
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,940
Barry sure this is Barry well I'll say

448
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,419
I'm I'm with Pete on the minimal change

449
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,340
um

450
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,000
ambivalent between one and three but uh

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
maybe the reference is good so three

452
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,820
but yeah I I understand John's concern

453
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,520
but I think minimal change especially in

454
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,960
the grammar is important

455
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,700
Ken

456
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,039
this is Kent having advocated for the

457
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,100
reference back to 21 which may

458
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,039
not be realistic uh I also agree with

459
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,400
Pete that minimal change in 22 I think

460
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,539
will be the least disruptive

461
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,280
okay Alex is a participant I think the

462
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,440
reason why I don't like just putting him

463
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,500
point there is because in theory there

464
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,700
can be other transports

465
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,539
uh that don't have to follow SMTP syntax

466
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,020
I am I I know it's a bit I'm happy to

467
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,080
put in AC for example

468
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,059
um instead of C

469
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:19,260
I I you know I'm not as fast as long as

470
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,419
this if the syntax is unchanged and

471
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,340
there is a comment you know voice empty

472
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,500
you know for transport in this MTP see

473
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,620
this so it actually can be normative but

474
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,539
be specific as well so I think that

475
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,380
works

476
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,799
John

477
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,400
I am not here

478
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,220
did you need to up we lost John for a

479
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,120
second

480
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,799
Barry you want to go and then when John

481
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,720
comes back we'll get John Barry we'll go

482
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,220
and we'll get John when he comes back um

483
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,159
how often does in the real world do we

484
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,580
actually see received lines put in by

485
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,400
transports other than smtps such that we

486
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,919
should jump through hoops I understand

487
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,039
we have to allow for it but I know we

488
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,500
see received lines put in by certain

489
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,940
spam engines

490
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,039
I'm not counting them

491
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,120
because the the spam part is I mean you

492
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,039
know there's this

493
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,659
we're not trying to make the grammar

494
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,840
work for the spammers

495
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,120
scientists

496
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,460
anti-spam sorry okay they actually put

497
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,500
received lines in that don't conform so

498
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,020
MTP rules I think we've seen a couple of

499
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,600
old ones not current ones yeah um old

500
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,480
ones do that we have seen interim

501
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
processes so that things that are doing

502
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,799
MDA kinds of operations or mailing list

503
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,080
Explorer kinds of operations will stick

504
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,659
a receive field in there to mark that

505
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,400
they've done something right and that's

506
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,200
still happening now I believe that

507
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
because I know I know we used to see it

508
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,940
all the time 20 years ago but

509
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,940
okay

510
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,480
uh John Clemson sorry uh you you

511
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,580
disappeared for a bit

512
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,140
sorry

513
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,340
um

514
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,860
uh for first answer to Barry's question

515
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,799
is 20 years ago definitely now I'm not

516
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,919
sure uh if we've got that stuff being

517
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,900
put in and if John Levine has an example

518
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,440
then that's definitive uh are all of

519
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,720
them actually following the

520
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,620
uh syntax including the date time in RMC

521
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,960
5322 form

522
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,539
I'm pretty sure by the way the answer to

523
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,640
that latter question John is no not all

524
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,059
of them are

525
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,059
then if the goal is to avoid breaking

526
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,340
existing implementations or the next

527
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
implementation to come along that's an

528
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,799
argument for

529
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,400
reducing the syntax in the direction of

530
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,720
unstructured even though

531
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,820
uh it's not an argument necessarily if

532
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,140
you're going all the way to unstructured

533
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,559
I don't know where we're going well I

534
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,059
think I think for

535
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,460
I'm sorry go ahead John you the floor is

536
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,940
yours I I can live with three

537
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,740
or any combination of two in the comment

538
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,559
uh if we do what other thing which does

539
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,299
not affect the syntax

540
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,940
which indicates a careful look at the

541
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,159
paragraph exposed this

542
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,260
and attempts to say well don't really

543
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,380
look here look at 5321 or look somewhere

544
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,279
else

545
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,440
because that paragraph is very hard to

546
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,880
follow unless one knows what it's

547
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,400
supposed to what is intended to mean

548
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,260
so I would be happy to work with you on

549
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,360
that paragraph if we stay with the

550
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,039
existing more or less with the existing

551
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,140
syntax but I think stay with the

552
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,900
existing syntax Without Really touring

553
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,120
up that paragraph on your mistake okay

554
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,159
that that's fair enough

555
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,320
um so here is this this paragraph the uh

556
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,539
yes that paragraph

557
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,360
that paragraph yeah

558
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,320
fine okay so but I I think uh your

559
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,539
answer is

560
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:10,380
um reasonable uh insofar as what we do

561
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,659
is if we're going to go that path the

562
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,419
two of us work on this paragraph

563
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:16,980
um we make a proposal to the working

564
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,080
group and if we can't come to consensus

565
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,460
on this paragraph then we have to go

566
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,539
back and figure out whether there's

567
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,000
consensus on the syntax

568
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,340
I I mean this this is not making life

569
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,960
Pleasant for the chairs and and I'm

570
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,600
sorry but at some point you're gonna

571
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,640
have to call this consensus rough

572
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,960
because it's gonna be rough one where

573
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,860
the other

574
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,700
yeah Barry uh this is Barry my my sense

575
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,039
is that I have all faith that Pete and

576
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,779
John together can come up with something

577
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,080
we'll all be able to live with so

578
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
more more faith than at least John

579
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
probably needs but but I appreciate your

580
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,418
support

581
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,760
I I appreciate expressions of Faith do

582
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,580
we so

583
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,580
do you feel Alexi like

584
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,000
that is going to make the chairs calm

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,640
and happy do I feel worse than I was

586
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,159
feeling before the section started yes

587
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,679
that's what I think I asked I think I

588
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,960
asked it the other way but that's okay

589
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,919
um I think that's a walkable yes okay so

590
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,419
what I'm hearing is

591
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,940
weak preference with no chain with

592
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,700
adding a comment to ABN F and no syntax

593
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,520
exchange and

594
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,860
editors of the two documents will

595
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,600
collaborate to propose the text to the

596
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,100
mailing list and we'll see whether we

597
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,600
get you know whether it gets I think so

598
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,380
um

599
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,659
and and you're gonna have to determine

600
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,080
how weak that support is and or how

601
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,440
strong that support is once the uh once

602
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,200
the paragraph comes out but yeah I think

603
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,659
that's that's what we're proposing at

604
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,039
this point

605
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,700
yeah I I'm I'm very unhappy about this

606
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,500
and we'll do a lot of nose holding while

607
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,720
we're working on it but um

608
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
uh but in a sense this problem should

609
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,900
have been solved with uh uh in in yam

610
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,960
and if we didn't get to it then Pete's

611
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,320
argument has some Merit despite the fact

612
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,460
that I don't like its implications

613
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,960
we both agree there is going to be nose

614
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,940
holding to a certain extent going on

615
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,140
yeah

616
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,000
um but yeah

617
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,860
okay

618
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,020
still on Tres had the fields who hold me

619
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,919
up here for this yes uh hopefully uh

620
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,760
this is something we can agree on in the

621
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,620
room

622
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,799
um this is a question that John asked

623
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,720
about

624
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,340
registry for the trace header fields

625
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,480
so

626
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,539
the question is

627
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,559
um

628
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,159
do we make a registry if we do how does

629
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,440
it interact with the existing registry

630
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,840
of message header Fields

631
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,820
um do we have a separate registry or do

632
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,039
we somehow combine them

633
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:11,880
um

634
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,179
do we want to add a discussion of any

635
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,400
sort about Trace header Fields as

636
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,059
comments in the current registry do we

637
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,500
want to just do nothing and keep

638
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,679
everything the way it is and again for

639
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,120
purposes of discussion I'll remind

640
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,460
everybody that we tend to Mush together

641
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,580
things which meet the syntax of trace a

642
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,179
b and F element things that are stuff

643
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,860
that gets stuck on the top messages as

644
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,659
it goes through the system and things

645
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,880
that happen to be called trace and are

646
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,220
dealt with

647
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,320
semantically by ignore this stuff unless

648
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,720
you know if you're parsing messages this

649
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,640
is for information only

650
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,340
um don't act on it in any particular way

651
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,480
if you're doing message courses and we

652
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,820
mix a third thing together which is

653
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,740
fields which may or may not be traced by

654
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,779
any

655
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:05,700
rational definition of Trace other than

656
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,580
the stuff which goes at the top

657
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,679
right things that end up at the top for

658
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,600
no particular reason whatsoever

659
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,520
right

660
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,880
this ticket is for Trace as currently

661
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,760
defined as in staff added

662
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,380
throughout the message through the

663
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,600
transport system and it it applies to

664
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,020
msas mtas mdas everything

665
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,840
right uh before we get the discussion I

666
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,440
did talk to Graham

667
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,100
about uh

668
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,799
registry and about the question on

669
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,440
whether it will be a good idea to remove

670
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,080
any fields from it and put it into a

671
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,940
separate registry

672
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,520
he said that without understanding too

673
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,500
much context the way I phrased the

674
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,360
question he said it wouldn't be a good

675
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,500
idea because the other registry is to be

676
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,720
able to find all message header Fields

677
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,179
yes

678
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:04,860
as far as

679
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,020
adding extra fields which are email

680
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,740
specific

681
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,299
like an extra column which only applies

682
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,440
to

683
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,899
you know Trace

684
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,360
or

685
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,899
a mangling description

686
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,779
to add this information he has no

687
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,700
preference and he thinks that either one

688
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,039
is walkable so in a way we kind of have

689
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,279
a choice that that's a good input from

690
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,100
from our uh right now let's talk about

691
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,260
whether people think it's a good idea to

692
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,140
have this registry

693
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,360
this is Barry so the um

694
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,880
but

695
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,679
that covered some of what I was going to

696
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,179
say the first thing I was going to say

697
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,320
is that

698
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,799
if we have a separate registry we must

699
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,340
leave these in the existing registry and

700
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,679
the definition of the new registry has

701
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,260
to say that nothing can go in here

702
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,740
unless it's already in the other one

703
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,380
um but the other thing that uh that

704
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,880
Alexei said was what I was going to

705
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,399
suggest God I hope not that we don't

706
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,140
need another registry I would rather

707
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,600
have information in the existing

708
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,419
registry that says this is one of those

709
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,659
things and whether that be a column for

710
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,840
it is or it isn't or whether it be a

711
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,059
description that that just verbally

712
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,399
tells us or whatever it is that that's

713
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,380
the way I think we should go

714
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,659
okay so actually maybe I should have

715
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,820
phrased the question of do people think

716
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,880
we need this information in a registry

717
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,580
in some form and you're saying yes

718
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,580
and you prefer as just

719
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,919
I'm I'm ambivalent on that but I'm

720
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,260
saying that if we do I think that's the

721
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,419
way we should do it but I'm not really

722
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,100
decided on whether we need that

723
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,919
absolutely not a new registry it would

724
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,539
not be harmful to have that information

725
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,360
so why not but it ought to just be a

726
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,100
comment or something in the existing

727
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,299
register fine thank you John Levine

728
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,600
yeah I'm going to agree with Barry in

729
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,980
substance but I'm going to tweak the

730
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,039
emphasis which is no registry no new

731
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,260
registry no no no no no

732
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,000
um I think adding a new column adding a

733
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,440
column to the existing Registries would

734
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,059
be straightforward and then we can bike

735
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,100
 about what goes in the column

736
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,140
and my inclination would be blank by

737
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,840
default yes if it's a normal one or a

738
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,600
footnote if if people do do weird things

739
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,080
with it

740
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,120
okay

741
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,260
who's next me ah um speaking as a

742
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,860
participant I I think I prefer

743
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,559
a new registry because it's it's kind of

744
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,779
easy to find if you're only looking for

745
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,480
these the reason why uh a while like

746
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,220
this is because for somebody writing MUA

747
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,039
um there is a common function for edit

748
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,980
existing message as new message and this

749
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,460
function typically uh

750
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,260
requires stripping all Trace header

751
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,480
Fields because uh

752
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,820
for security reasons

753
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,800
ah

754
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,199
so for to implement this I kind of would

755
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,139
like to have this information somewhere

756
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,060
um I don't mind if it's an extra column

757
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,940
existing registry or a comment so I

758
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,099
would like to have this information you

759
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,839
know kind of available about the three

760
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,259
choices

761
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,300
Mr Clinton

762
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,980
first of all I I'm sorry I pose this is

763
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,800
a question because I don't have an

764
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,699
answer uh or strong preferences except

765
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,500
to say that if we are going to single

766
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,960
out Trace fields from other kinds of

767
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,940
extension Fields with syntax rules

768
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,480
somewhere then we or or with rules about

769
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,859
what goes at the top

770
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,660
that we better be able to identify Trace

771
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,000
fields in the registry now whether that

772
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,119
means two Registries one registry with

773
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,060
comments uh two Registries with pointers

774
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,280
to each other uh and which way the

775
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,859
pointers should go I'm almost completely

776
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:16,560
agnostic I just want to be sure they've

777
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,560
traced Trace fields and extension Trace

778
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,380
fields are different from extension

779
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,079
fields that we have a clear way to

780
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,619
identify that from the Registries or

781
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,960
whatever documentation we require but

782
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,000
since that header field registry is if I

783
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,760
recall first come first serve we don't

784
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,800
require any documentation this has been

785
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,160
registered

786
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
okay again

787
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,599
hi this is Ken uh I just want to uh

788
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,579
plus one with John Levine and Barry said

789
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,839
no new registry new column please

790
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,000
so

791
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,780
um

792
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,180
editor hat off for sure but I have a

793
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,339
question

794
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,680
which is what are the semantics of this

795
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,780
column going to be

796
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,560
because as I tried to harp on before

797
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,760
there is a big distinction between thing

798
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,400
introduced by the transport system

799
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400
thing introduced by for instance a Spam

800
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,020
checking engine

801
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,099
and thing that happens to be added

802
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,339
showing some action with this message uh

803
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,040
whether or not it was so a submission

804
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,200
and or delivery and this happened to end

805
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,760
up up here at the top of the message

806
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,640
which we clearly know are not Trace

807
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,800
fields

808
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,740
um what are the semantics of being

809
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,760
in this column are they trace as in mtas

810
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,060
are only allowed to do this

811
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,060
okay yeah

812
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,960
we had a long discussion over a year and

813
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,180
a half include when Ned was still around

814
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,339
about definition of a trace header

815
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:06,359
fields

816
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,000
as a semantic of it this is what in the

817
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,339
current draft

818
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,380
I would like not to reopen this

819
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,480
discussion I agree

820
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,320
and the question I asked earlier was

821
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,839
assuming that definition this is what

822
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,780
the registry is for so if you want to

823
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,820
register other Hydra fields which are

824
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,560
not Trace

825
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,480
they will well they will still go to

826
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,820
message how they feel uh names registry

827
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,020
anyway

828
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,640
but they will have nothing in this

829
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,200
column

830
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,599
and so I I just want to check with John

831
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,660
because it was John's I'm sorry there's

832
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,160
two Johns and I keep doing that I want

833
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,500
to check for John Clemson

834
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,000
um there is something in what you said

835
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,940
which made me think that it was that you

836
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,400
wanted things marked in this column that

837
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,700
were more than the definition of Trace

838
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,800
that we've already got did I get that

839
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,380
wrong

840
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,540
uh I think so good

841
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,700
that will make Alexi happy and that will

842
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,500
make me happy too

843
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,880
yeah our our only question then becomes

844
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,060
A variation of the earlier question

845
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,880
which is whether we are kind of still

846
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,560
comfortable with the stuff there's Trace

847
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,720
fields and whether that definition is

848
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,780
consistent between 8 21 and eight

849
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,940
between five three two one and five

850
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,160
three two two and whether we can

851
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,020
straighten that out by an appropriate

852
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,180
hand waving paragraph and I don't know

853
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,619
the answer to those three questions to

854
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,560
which I write in a paragraph

855
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,280
do do we have I do believe beat yeah

856
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,400
that your syntax may want to and if this

857
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,500
has been said on the list that your

858
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,800
syntax may want to drop the attempt at

859
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,859
distinguishing in the ABN app between

860
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,960
Trace fields and other things that we do

861
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,020
that in Pros because the what goes to

862
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,520
the top stuff is getting very very

863
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,700
confusing in the ABN F it's hard to

864
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,520
follow and uh and it's not and it's not

865
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,680
clear given other stuff which goes at

866
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,420
the beginning which is not what an

867
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,859
irrational person would call a trace

868
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:17,960
field it's not really helpful anymore

869
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,079
right

870
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
um

871
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,700
that's going to take a think

872
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,960
because I know what you're talking about

873
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,780
it's that optional field in the top

874
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,640
chunk yes

875
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,700
um

876
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,599
it's including resent in the top chunk

877
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,640
and not somewhere else because that can

878
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,619
end up at the bottom Brothers you know

879
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,660
yep yep Federal Camp works

880
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,560
all right

881
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,359
um

882
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,359
I think I have my marching orders

883
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,420
for what I need to do

884
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,339
um the registry thing ain't my problem

885
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,700
but I'm comfortable with

886
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,359
understanding what tasks I have for 5322

887
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,920
well because I think the registry is

888
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,780
going to be mentioned in 5321 or just

889
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,000
created separately right or I'm not

890
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,640
saying

891
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,660
that's an interesting question maybe

892
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,980
it's in your document it should be

893
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,540
created in your document because it's

894
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,720
not only SMTP that's adding these

895
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,339
however

896
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,980
let's not decide this here because I

897
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,020
think we can write the text about

898
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,420
registry we kind of know how to do Ayana

899
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,160
considerations

900
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,020
and then we'll figure out where to put

901
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,560
it okay let's not not bike shed on this

902
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,119
now good

903
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,640
okay any any other slides that I have to

904
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,819
cover

905
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,160
just did that any other slides that we

906
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,140
have time for that's the question isn't

907
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,980
it good I get to run away now have fun

908
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,099
Okay so

909
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:59,460
um we're way over our you know time

910
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,560
allocated for this so what we'll do is

911
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,720
Johnny you quickly talk about recent

912
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,859
changes

913
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,260
then we try to talk about are they under

914
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,240
Registries because hopefully it's not

915
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,280
too difficult well

916
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,260
I'll just keep my all my fingers crossed

917
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,560
you know because I can never know now

918
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,660
um and then if we get time to talk about

919
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,760
SMTP extensions

920
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,980
again we'll try to do that

921
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,260
after that I suspect we'll run out of

922
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,420
time

923
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,000
okay let let me try to go through this

924
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,900
slide almost instantly by saying that we

925
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,400
aren't going to have time to discuss any

926
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,800
of these issues today I don't think

927
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
we're going to need to discuss any of

928
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,820
these issues today but I wanted to call

929
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,980
people's attention to them because if

930
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,140
they do have problems or objections we

931
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,880
should hear about them quickly on the

932
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,000
mailing list or or if necessary to get

933
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
that interim scheduled real quickly and

934
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
do it then the only thing here which has

935
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,579
not been talked about extensively uh is

936
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,740
a

937
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,359
arbitrary small group decision that we

938
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,060
were getting ourselves into a hole if a

939
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,000
server was

940
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,400
unavailable but only temporarily and if

941
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,380
whoever's was responding is a TP

942
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,780
connection was able to respond to that

943
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,940
connection and whether one could

944
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,940
rationally use a code there and if so

945
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,740
what the code should be

946
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,280
uh and if we start inventing new codes

947
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,140
at this stage we're going down a serious

948
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,839
Rat Hole so the arbitrary decision was

949
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,660
to repurpose

950
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,420
450 if used in that context to mean

951
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,760
server temporarily unavailable mailbox

952
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,160
temporarily unveiled but those are the

953
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,980
only new issues here and it's all

954
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,619
covered in much more detail in the uh in

955
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,000
the relevant appendix to uh uh 5321 Biz

956
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,980
15 and I would encourage people who

957
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,040
haven't read that to do it

958
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,380
yeah and uh speaking as individual about

959
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,960
450 and server temporarily unavailable I

960
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,460
think it's very much in the spirit of

961
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,640
definition of the reply code so I as far

962
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,440
as I'm concerned it seems very sensible

963
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,700
change

964
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,099
but obviously again if you agree with

965
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,380
this or if you disagree

966
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,319
send the email to the mailing list

967
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,780
uh if you're agreeing that you know your

968
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,280
silence will be

969
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,420
um considered as consent

970
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,140
right

971
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,540
so um

972
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,720
John did quite quite a good job on SMTP

973
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,339
extensions to which we'll hopefully get

974
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:35,099
to today uh but

975
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,560
um he also identified that mod we have

976
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,040
three other registries that uh have now

977
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,740
subsections and

978
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,339
um

979
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,640
after looking into this in more details

980
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,760
it looks like they don't actually you

981
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,300
know be very exact about the ion

982
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,119
registration procedure for them

983
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,839
so are just literal tags

984
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:04,560
it just says sorry

985
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,359
the only literal tag which is defined

986
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,579
now is IPv6

987
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,220
so this becomes important only for the

988
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,819
next Network transport

989
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:16,500
i t layer format

990
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,420
and unless you think you want to see

991
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,780
ipv10 without

992
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,579
intf consensus that is probably remains

993
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,680
where it is

994
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,780
yeah so I think you're basically saying

995
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,460
it should be standard section I think

996
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,200
these are rare enough

997
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,500
that if somebody you know uh creates a

998
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,480
new underlying protocol will need to

999
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,460
think about it we'll need an RFC so

1000
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,319
standard section right

1001
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,800
yeah the the only reason I can sue for

1002
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,319
making this permissive is we want to is

1003
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,700
if we want to encourage to have a

1004
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,380
service attacks

1005
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,880
right so um I think my suggestion here

1006
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,140
is that

1007
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,260
uh the text still needs to be clarified

1008
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,079
request standardization you know

1009
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,240
by specifying you know I you know

1010
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,400
standard strike RFC kind of thing so

1011
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,140
just make it explicit what exact

1012
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,599
registration passage is

1013
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,300
any comments on this any objections

1014
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,480
obviously we'll still need to verify it

1015
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,040
on the mailing list but I'm just kind of

1016
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,240
trying to get the sense in the room

1017
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,599
right next one is

1018
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,300
male transmission types

1019
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,680
for Via and with clauses

1020
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,980
and the current text is says only by

1021
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,260
standardization or by way of rxc

1022
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,300
documented isg approved experimental

1023
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,800
protocol extension

1024
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,460
again I think it's not actually using

1025
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,020
the

1026
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,160
um

1027
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,099
most modern Ayana registration procedure

1028
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,300
language

1029
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,119
so we need to tweak this to actually say

1030
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,140
exactly what what it's supposed to be

1031
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,980
um

1032
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,380
Barry do you want to come up and

1033
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,079
comment on this and

1034
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,359
yeah I

1035
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:09,300
if you want to go with BCP 26 current

1036
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,540
BCP 26 language then the right thing to

1037
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,760
do is to say

1038
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,839
um

1039
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,240
not standards action but

1040
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,359
um ietf review I think is what it's

1041
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,640
called yes the second choice below yeah

1042
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,619
yeah there is ietf review that that

1043
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:28,680
allows theoretically allows

1044
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,619
um informational or BCPS but in practice

1045
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,300
it's you know nobody's going to write

1046
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,200
that as informational so

1047
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,420
um if you want to explicitly you can say

1048
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,260
I ietf review but not informational if

1049
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,640
you want to go there but I don't think

1050
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,319
we need to

1051
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,780
yeah

1052
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,020
any objections to go in the ietf

1053
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,119
informational

1054
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,180
ITF review route

1055
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,680
that will also allow informational

1056
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,359
okay I'm not hearing

1057
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,579
I don't hear anything but we saw John

1058
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,359
hold his nose

1059
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,140
well Murray was happy Murray was showing

1060
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,819
you know that is you know approving

1061
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:24,480
science okay fine so let's do this

1062
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,260
um

1063
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,640
and similarly

1064
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,880
uh thumbs up is my equivalent of holding

1065
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,180
my nose

1066
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,339
thank you

1067
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,619
um additional registered Clauses that

1068
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:42,420
that's basically what

1069
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,700
um new attributes going to receive

1070
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,020
credit field

1071
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,480
and again it kind of

1072
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,440
um

1073
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,359
the text is slightly confusing it says

1074
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,220
standard stuck in one place then mention

1075
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,680
experimental again

1076
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,900
I suggest we probably want to just say

1077
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,300
ITF review

1078
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,000
uh and it's also keeping consistency

1079
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,980
between three Registries probably a good

1080
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,280
idea

1081
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,260
any

1082
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,900
objections so any arguments uh for doing

1083
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,500
something else

1084
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,240
she seen those holding gesture but I can

1085
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,400
certainly live with this

1086
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,660
okay

1087
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,180
well uh I kind of we don't have time to

1088
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,280
debate this bit here but if this is

1089
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,859
making me think about when I update BCP

1090
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:34,319
26 whether there ought to be something

1091
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,020
that says ietf review but does not allow

1092
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,140
informational but anyway yeah I don't

1093
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,359
think we I personally don't think we

1094
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:44,280
care enough here in the working group

1095
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,680
and when you have experimental you might

1096
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,780
as well allow information especially if

1097
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,339
it's documenting something which is in

1098
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,380
use so you know it's kind of okay all

1099
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,560
right

1100
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,540
ah and now

1101
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,180
for the final 12 minutes

1102
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,920
everybody wake up

1103
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,920
do a little bit of exercises

1104
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,440
I am a registration procedure for SMTP

1105
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,980
extensions

1106
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,020
um

1107
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,300
as it happens my slides might be out of

1108
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,220
date now

1109
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,420
um

1110
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,619
but

1111
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:23,720
this is basically uh

1112
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,020
how we got here

1113
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,640
this is what we we've done so far

1114
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,960
um

1115
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,960
and

1116
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,000
okay so we have to waste you know there

1117
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,280
are some questions I wanted to ask in

1118
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,160
regards to existing text which might or

1119
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,560
might not depend on the general

1120
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,540
direction question

1121
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,460
shall we discuss General Direction first

1122
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,400
well I I'll say that I briefly read

1123
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,700
John's very recent note

1124
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,040
to the mailing list and I think that's

1125
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,980
probably the right direction of having

1126
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,020
um permanent and provisional or whatever

1127
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,839
we want to call them where

1128
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:17,400
permanent is uh stricter review and

1129
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,160
provisional covers the rest of it so

1130
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,260
basically that gives us the path for

1131
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,359
anybody to register something with

1132
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:27,119
minimal checking but still having most

1133
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,880
of the stuff properly that okay let me

1134
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,180
try to rephrase it for uh for the

1135
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,560
audience who haven't seen the message

1136
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,599
and then John you can tell me whether

1137
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,480
I'm right or wrong I think basically

1138
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,040
proposal is to use something like uh

1139
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,680
URI registry which has

1140
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,260
a permanent registration that requires

1141
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,180
full template and more strict procedure

1142
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,920
and provisional registration that

1143
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,980
requires very many work

1144
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,819
is this roughly the proposal is it

1145
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,440
correct John

1146
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,859
uh it is I I would prefer that we get

1147
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:08,180
rid of the word provisional and yes

1148
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,559
and find the term was more closely

1149
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,500
approximates we wanted to register this

1150
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,940
name but we

1151
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,099
don't have any interest in pursuing the

1152
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,020
studio ITF

1153
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,240
um Israel has the implication of the

1154
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,819
two-step process this is really not a

1155
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,160
two-step process this is a some people

1156
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,859
care about what the ietf thinks and want

1157
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,680
that recognition and others don't and we

1158
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,559
just separate them and uh and that

1159
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,500
should allow us to to move forward and

1160
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,280
move forward with the with the fcfs rule

1161
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,520
on the uh on the on the I don't care

1162
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,700
about the iatf stuff uh which is much

1163
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,819
better than trying to screw around with

1164
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:52,859
redefining

1165
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,619
um specification required so it's almost

1166
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:57,900
for his first come first service quite

1167
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,640
which is where I think we've been going

1168
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,859
around in circles

1169
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:06,180
yeah so how about if we call one section

1170
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,940
um

1171
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,160
reviewed by the ietf and the other

1172
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,619
section other registrations or something

1173
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,900
like that

1174
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,160
um I I think that's the right direction

1175
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,800
I would be delighted if Alexi were to

1176
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,440
just to to assign you and I to be a

1177
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,000
small commit you sort that out or

1178
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,859
they're trying to spend time done done

1179
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:30,720
okay

1180
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,140
um I will do that and speaking as a

1181
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,900
participant I actually

1182
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,059
I quite like this direction as well that

1183
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,160
that works as well I I was thinking

1184
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,960
about some of my questions were about uh

1185
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,760
registrations for

1186
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,760
extensions defined in rfcs and I think

1187
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,920
that kind of addresses addresses it is

1188
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,960
it's nicely

1189
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,680
um

1190
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,920
and you will do you will need to update

1191
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,540
the document but I think some of the

1192
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,520
work you've done will still be useful so

1193
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,020
you don't have to actually go back to

1194
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,300
the previous version and restart I think

1195
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,280
you you can probably build on what you

1196
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,359
already have

1197
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,880
well that that that was my remaining

1198
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,859
question what I did with with Dash 15

1199
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,339
was slightly at 14 but entirely in 15

1200
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:22,940
was to uh was to pull all of the text

1201
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,319
also the text recommending that people

1202
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,420
really should ask for advice and listen

1203
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,900
to it or get advice and listen to it out

1204
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:36,480
of the Ianna stuff and into uh 2.2.2 and

1205
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,099
unless somebody objects I'm inclined to

1206
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,960
leave that there because asking for

1207
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,160
advice is still a good idea

1208
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,280
to adjust that by saying there that if

1209
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,599
they go through the standards through

1210
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,400
the ietf procedures

1211
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,020
uh that they're getting that advice

1212
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,300
whether they like it or not but I don't

1213
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,040
want to go off I'll pull out all the

1214
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,720
text

1215
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,300
correct and looking at on the list of

1216
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,160
questions on the current text that you

1217
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,800
have in the draft before you came with

1218
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,500
this proposal I can see that number five

1219
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,480
certainly goes away because we just kind

1220
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,980
of addressed it

1221
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,520
right

1222
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,859
some of the other ones uh might be knit

1223
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,920
I think I noticed that in your text

1224
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,020
we probably should say that uh

1225
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,020
registration that done in proposed

1226
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,700
standards should have it as a change

1227
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,380
controller that's kind of very standard

1228
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,720
for other registers so for all these

1229
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,220
questions just in the interest of time

1230
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,780
why don't you just throw these at John

1231
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,599
and me in our little powwow that we're

1232
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,359
gonna do and uh we'll come back with a

1233
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:46,740
proposal okay John quick if you have

1234
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,900
Do you have a

1235
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,540
if you have a quick answer to this or

1236
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,359
well I I think the quick answer is that

1237
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:56,579
most of this is going to be solved in a

1238
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:58,559
fairly automatic Way by sweating this

1239
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,819
registry in half

1240
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:03,380
and uh uh and

1241
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,460
and other than that I'm more than happy

1242
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,440
to take Barry's suggestion

1243
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,180
okay so this goes away

1244
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,900
yeah that could that that would

1245
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,619
definitely goes away

1246
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:21,079
um

1247
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,079
yes

1248
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,059
okay

1249
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:29,520
we'll have five minutes

1250
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,680
for

1251
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,920
and we'll let uh cam just quickly tell

1252
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,839
us what the recent changes are to a lot

1253
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:38,400
of people of

1254
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,680
things they might not have been fully

1255
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,140
paying attention to but um

1256
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,059
uh yeah so briefly

1257
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:45,780
um

1258
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,520
John and I crafted some new text for the

1259
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,680
introduction the the introduction that

1260
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,359
was there was more of a placeholder than

1261
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,460
an actual introduction to what the the

1262
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,140
current draft is so please take a look

1263
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,700
at that

1264
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,460
um I added a very very minimal security

1265
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,280
sections section just to get people to

1266
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,059
focus on it and uh bash and help add

1267
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:07,680
text where needed

1268
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,859
uh issue 51

1269
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:12,359
um that's kind of been split into the

1270
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,700
HTML specific stuff and more General

1271
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,280
stuff and very uh graciously provided me

1272
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,440
with a bunch of texts for the general uh

1273
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,960
stuff mostly uh case sensitivity and

1274
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,280
stuff so thank you for that Barry

1275
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,500
um

1276
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,000
added a little bit of text uh that was

1277
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
posted on issue 55 and used to the four

1278
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,540
claws again it's there for bashing uh if

1279
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,280
you are so inclined please provide

1280
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,339
replacement or augmented text

1281
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,680
issue 65 I think this was pretty

1282
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,880
straightforward I think we'd probably

1283
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,559
just close this uh stating the

1284
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,079
implications should or are expected to

1285
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:52,140
support mine we didn't use uh BCP 14

1286
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,140
language there

1287
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,599
uh lastly well not quite lastly but I

1288
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,460
did it uh at an acknowledgment section

1289
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,260
with the list of people that have

1290
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,680
provided text both on the list and uh in

1291
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,220
the GitHub if I've missed anybody

1292
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,480
including yourselves please just send me

1293
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,980
a note and I will be more than happy to

1294
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,500
add you to that section

1295
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,280
um

1296
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,440
issue 38 that this is the uh 78 versus

1297
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,819
998 uh line limit stuff and I failed to

1298
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,559
reach out to Pete as I was supposed to

1299
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:28,619
in time to get text in this draft

1300
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,740
so uh we will get together and work on

1301
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,339
that uh 66 I figure what that is that is

1302
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:38,520
oh is that the time zone issue yeah to

1303
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,140
which we're not going to get to but

1304
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,480
that's it yeah there's just a minimal

1305
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,859
placeholder there in case we do come up

1306
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:45,839
with text and decide to do something

1307
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,359
okay we have three minutes I will try to

1308
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:50,900
ask two questions

1309
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,780
uh John noticed that some people are

1310
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,880
trying percent in code known as Gmail

1311
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,119
addresses so I think we want to add some

1312
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:02,280
text saying that you cannot do this

1313
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,200
because you cannot actually expect all

1314
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,960
systems to follow this I think it's very

1315
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,359
fair Fairly straightforward can you

1316
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,559
happy to

1317
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,140
authorize just I will take a crack at

1318
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,359
some text okay

1319
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,280
and in regards to the uh

1320
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,859
email addresses in the Forum I'm going

1321
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:25,440
to skip two slides about what you can

1322
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,920
edit again uh

1323
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,559
I encourage people to read the latest

1324
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,780
draft and comment

1325
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,000
please do I I think I

1326
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,740
captured everything that was on the list

1327
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,780
but it's always possible to miss

1328
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,819
something

1329
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:43,740
but I want to actually

1330
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,140
uh T is one issue related to this is

1331
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,880
basically the as at the moment is

1332
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,040
pointing to HTML document and this is

1333
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,799
ABN F from this document

1334
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:59,099
the question for this group is

1335
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:03,140
are we happy with this ABN f

1336
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,059
and also

1337
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:06,839
um

1338
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:09,240
the related question I'll be happy to

1339
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,420
reference HTML document or do we have to

1340
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,000
have one do we prefer to have our own

1341
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,900
definition because obviously HTML

1342
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,880
what what working group can probably

1343
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,099
change the definition uh without

1344
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:26,119
consulting with us

1345
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,520
and if we don't or if we keep the

1346
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,319
reference to their document

1347
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,359
and if we are not quite happy with that

1348
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,740
definition we need to fit this

1349
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,839
information back to them

1350
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,359
so any quick comments on this

1351
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,660
John real quick before John speaks my

1352
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,700
reasoning for just putting the link in

1353
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,940
was if that topic document changes it

1354
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,400
does not make the as

1355
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,660
uh

1356
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,640
incorrect at any point in time it's

1357
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,500
always pointing to whatever the lives

1358
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,540
the most current for some definition of

1359
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,859
incorrect it's not going to be

1360
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:00,599
inconsistent I would say

1361
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:02,940
but whether this is what we want or not

1362
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,680
I think that's a question yeah John

1363
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,780
Levine yeah my answer to most of your

1364
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,520
questions is no

1365
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,319
um I am not happy with I am not happy

1366
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,059
with this grammar but I don't think we

1367
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:13,559
can ignore it

1368
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,540
um and in particular I'm not happy that

1369
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,400
it allows consecutive dots which nobody

1370
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,020
which in practice there is actually a

1371
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,119
text on this already so it's kind of

1372
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,220
extracts that compensate for the grammar

1373
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,500
not being quite yeah so yeah my

1374
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,760
inclination is to

1375
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,680
point to the HTML document

1376
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,420
explain why it's wrong

1377
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,760
yes

1378
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,099
admit that a whole lot of people use it

1379
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:41,099
and I think out of band use our contacts

1380
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:43,440
with with with the web crowd to

1381
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,140
encourage them to fix it

1382
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,020
so we can okay so who wants to be on the

1383
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,359
team took on you know on the small team

1384
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,720
to write some text and contact them I

1385
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,579
guess I just volunteered didn't I you

1386
01:00:56,579 --> 01:00:59,640
did and I would like at least one other

1387
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,480
person for this

1388
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:06,420
yeah okay aren't fine

1389
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,880
okay

1390
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,059
John another John yeah as I think I

1391
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,760
mentioned on list there is already a

1392
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,119
discussion going on with nw3c

1393
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:20,460
between the HTML group and the

1394
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,040
internationalization group about this

1395
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,900
syntax

1396
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,020
and maybe it will change and maybe it

1397
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,299
will not change and maybe if it does

1398
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:32,579
change what WG will pick we'll pay

1399
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:34,920
attention to it and maybe they won't

1400
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,740
but I would really like to see us figure

1401
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,319
out how to avoid

1402
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,079
getting tangled up with that because

1403
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:44,700
even if

1404
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,480
if John with my help and I guess I sort

1405
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,599
of volunteered to do that uh go off and

1406
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,400
approach them it's not clear that

1407
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,839
whatever it is we say will be stable

1408
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,020
right

1409
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,940
so would you rather uh us uh cut and

1410
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,339
pasting ABN F and you know maybe fixing

1411
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:10,380
it up or

1412
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,799
the wish um I I

1413
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:17,579
think I would prefer Pros

1414
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:19,680
which is there are other definitions out

1415
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,319
there including this one

1416
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:26,359
uh but if uh

1417
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,319
but if you expect things to interoperate

1418
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:33,420
really better follow our specifications

1419
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,240
rather than whatever is made up

1420
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,480
somewhere else as uh as part of an

1421
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,819
interface to other kinds of systems

1422
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,579
and if you want to set it that way that

1423
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:47,760
one needs to pick the uh uh the common

1424
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,220
subset of whatever else is going on but

1425
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,059
uh

1426
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,980
but I think that if uh if the

1427
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,420
HTML definitions are a little bit broken

1428
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,280
and are going to get either better or

1429
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,640
worse over time that's setting them in

1430
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,260
something which sounds like normatively

1431
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,319
it's just looking for trouble

1432
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:09,920
okay

1433
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:11,400
um

1434
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,280
can I suggest you you suggest you review

1435
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,520
what's Ken wrote in the draft

1436
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,500
because I think some of what you're

1437
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,839
suggesting is already covered other than

1438
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,900
you know obviously referencing HTML and

1439
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,059
you suggest edits

1440
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,880
yep okay

1441
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,160
right on that note we are three minutes

1442
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,700
over time uh can I have a quick show of

1443
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,160
hands who uh who is happy with having

1444
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,780
interim

1445
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,359
early December to

1446
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:45,500
I have slides now

1447
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:47,460
um

1448
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,960
okay at least uh three people plus me

1449
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,299
John you're you're happy God is Happy

1450
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:55,440
okay

1451
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,160
Pete

1452
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:00,660
are you happy with the interim in this

1453
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,119
early December

1454
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,740
okay

1455
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,480
all right well

1456
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,240
um let's do that and uh in the meantime

1457
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,819
we actually people can work on various

1458
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:14,160
tickets maybe we can make progress on

1459
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,200
stuff we we agreed here today

1460
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:22,500
okay thank you very much all for coming

1461
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,000
and joining us remotely

1462
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,319
I don't think we quite get you know

1463
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:34,380
various drafts and IG review for

1464
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:38,119
Christmas but let's um

1465
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,599
let's push for progress on this please

1466
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:47,760
thank you very much

1467
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,440
obviously the more progress we can make

1468
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,880
on the mailing list

1469
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,299
uh the better off we are and if that if

1470
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:55,619
that results in canceling the internet

1471
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:57,480
because we'd rather go to IHF last call

1472
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,520
that would be delightful

1473
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,200
absolutely

1474
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,540
all right thank you all

1475
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,400
thanks very much enjoy London

1476
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,520
okay

1477
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,578
if you're simply

1478
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,220
um

1479
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:47,539
foreign
