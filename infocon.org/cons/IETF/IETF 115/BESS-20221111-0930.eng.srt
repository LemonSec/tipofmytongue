31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,680
about how to handle this and we have a

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,020
little bit of slack in it conveniently

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,720
if we keep to time

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,220

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,080
sitting at publication requested at the

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,700
moment

um virtual ethernet segment draft which

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,739
is in ad follower I think Andrew's

54
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,519
following it up at the moment

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,459
um

56
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,040
uh the VW BPW evpn vpws fxc draft uh as

57
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,680

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,379
um and the evpn aggregation label draft

59
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,340
um is with Andrew

60
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,120
okay under we've got quite a few

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,980
documents under Shepard's review we had

62
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,319
a big queue of working group last calls

63
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,840
done over the last year or so and this

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,659
is unfortunately backed up a bit

65
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,800
um

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,720
so I think rank money you've done a

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,540
review of the evpn Redundant multicast

68
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,420
Source draft uh it's waiting for is that

69
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,640
still waiting for write up yes I'll be

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,179
sending it after okay

71
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,840
um

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,099
the evpn uh well Champion PA draft

73
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,680
um I think Stefan has provided a review

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,780
for that

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,180
um it's uh waiting for Stephanie waiting

76
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,440
for anything else on that before you do

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,700
your write-up

78
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,400
no I think it is okay now uh because I

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,560
requested Realtors to reduce the number

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,319
of offers and we documented and this has

81
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,900
been done uh so I think the next step

82
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,840
now will be to request the uh routing

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,120
directorate review as part of the of the

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
new process

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,720
if this is a really only missing piece

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,580
and before moving to isg

87
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,480

114
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,880
that and we are analyzing that request

115
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,580
to see how much we need to look at 8584

116
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,320
and see how much it really updates okay

117

118

draft is waiting for right up from

120
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,699
Stefan

121
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,520
um the sd-wan usage draft

122
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,100
um just went through working group last

123
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,539
call

124
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,520
um but there is a routing area

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,400
directorate review of that draft

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
um which we're still waiting for the

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,820
authors to address to look at the

128
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,440
comments I think they were fairly minor

129
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,900
comments to be honest and

130
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,820
um just a reminder that we will be

131
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,280
sending all drafts through rooting area

132
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,860
directorate review from now on on the

133
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,020
request of our ad so when when we do a

134
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,460
working group last call we'll do that

135
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,020
we've been typically doing that anyway

136
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,360
but we'll we'll make sure that we do

137
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,139
absolutely all of them

138
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,759
Sasha do you do you want to say

139
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,539
something you're in

140
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,319
uh Sasha Weinstein ribbon

141
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,199
I would like to understand what happens

142
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,900
with the evpn young

143
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,380
uh it appears as one of the uh

144
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,220
objectives in the charter the draft has

145
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,000
expired uh has been there is a war group

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,699
document that has expired four years ago

147
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,080
I have sent a few emails to the authors

148
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,979
to the group to the chairs uh asking

149
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,400
whether this work has been known include

150
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,080
dropped or or if not whether it is going

151
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,539
to be resumed and I haven't got any

152
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,220
responses whatsoever

153
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,979
okay so if I can answer that question so

154
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,199
there was a kind of a consensus call

155
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,940
that we did I think just over a year ago

156
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,500
about what to do with the young drafts

157
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,639
because they weren't being progressed

158
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,199
actively at the time and we had a lot of

159
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,479
other protocol documents to deal with

160
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,740
then

161
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,259
um so they were they were parked

162
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,699
should say their parents working group

163
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,259
drafts I think on the on the tracker if

164
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,699
it doesn't we need to fix that but if

165
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,199
there's somebody who is able to pick

166
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,000
them up and run with them that that

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
would be good yeah at some point there

168
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,620
was a system we had to wait for some

169
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,319
dependencies for over young models you

170
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,819
know the working groups so for instance

171
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,759
the bgp one uh and so ones that we are

172
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
not ready at that time so there was no

173
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,720
way to really progress this document

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,520
until the other ones were were closed

175
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,139
a but

176
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,860
is it going to be to be

177
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,720
resurrected and uh progressed at some

178
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,139
time or is it just going of course no no

179
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,720
it's not it's absolutely not canceled so

180
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,000
I I would say it will be up to the

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,919
working group to design when to resume

182
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,940
it

183
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,919
it's perfectly fine to uh to go ahead

184
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,259
with the documents if we are now ready

185
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,539
and we if we have completely cleared the

186
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,099
dependencies that we have with the

187
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,699
overall young models

188
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:29,160
uh okay because this is something that

189
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,320
from my point of view is needed and the

190
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,839
we don't know my colleagues and I don't

191
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,059
know what to look for and what to expect

192
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,598
thank you

193
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,279
okay this EVP and I said CMAC flash

194
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,560
draft is waiting for a write-up from me

195
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,180
so I think you're waiting in the queue

196
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,700
for um the other drafts right

197
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,760
so the the evpn ipvpn working into

198
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,700
working draft so that that is still in a

199
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,200
kind of an extended last call at the

200
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,420
moment because we did we had a review

201
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,940
from the IDR working group

202
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,459
um and the chairs had some comments on

203
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,600
that draft

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,560
so go ahead

205
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,779
um this is

206
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,180
um this is the feedback uh the best

207
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,019
chairs suggest I provided this at this

208
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,800
time

209
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,860
uh this my review of this found three

210
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,399
things it goes against an

211
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,140
roc-4456 requirement for full

212
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,580
distribution routes with route

213
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,779
reflectors this can be simply noted as

214
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,399
we've discussed that with the best

215
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,700
chairs and find that the topology in a

216
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,040
wild garden works against it it also

217
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,860
specifies a transitive uh path attribute

218
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,220
bpath without an open capability

219
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,580
limitation and specifies changes to for

220
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,899
RFC 4271 without an open capability

221
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,339
limitation

222
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,420
the last two are uh could break I

223
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,260
understand the word could not must uh

224
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,680
uh break the b2p route selection in a

225
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,540
modified

226
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,399
4270 win in the case of a partial

227
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,300
deployment that may could could lose an

228
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,180
inconsistent in its Cur

229
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,500
um so the IDR chairs are concerned uh um

230
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,019
about the approval of a deep path in the

231
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:33,660
4270 changes without an open capability

232
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,420
we realize at this time there are wild

233
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,740
Gardens construct or AKA

234
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,260
constrained domains in VPN but past

235
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,500
experiences with bgp lead us to believe

236
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,860
that bgb updates can escape walled

237
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,740
Gardens and cause harm to the internet

238
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,060
and perhaps some of you know of

239
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,820
incidents where this occurred

240
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,640
um again we think that there are some

241
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,800
things because it is a deployed topology

242
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,820
where configuration can help that

243
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,839
um and uh we look to continue this

244
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
discussion with the chairs and with the

245
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,839
authors I want to thank Stefan and Jorge

246
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,100
for their great interaction on this

247
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,579
okay

248
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,880
Jorge

249
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,100
yeah so I just wanted to say that uh

250
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,339
first of all uh thank you sue for the

251
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,040
thorough review and all the interaction

252
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
as well

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,100
and uh yeah we are discussing among the

254
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,680
authors our understanding is based on

255
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,399
Sue's uh review is that the the blocking

256
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,100
issue right now is to provide some

257
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
solution to avoid the leakage

258
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,000
of this d-path attribute into uh Safi

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,040
one uh routes

260
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,740
to avoid uh basically the potential

261
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,680
issues that the ASU was referring to so

262
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
that's our understanding and we will

263
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,760
work uh with that in mind

264
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
okay

265
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,040
thank you

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,700
okay we also have the image split

267
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,620
Horizon draft I think stood in in uh

268
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,459
working group last call

269
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,839
right uh the evpn SR p2mp draft we think

270
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,000
is is ready for working group Master

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
call it's in our in our queue if there's

272
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,019
any other

273
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,700
um working group documents that the

274
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,399
authors think are ready and we haven't

275
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,200
listed them please uh raise up to the

276
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,500
chairs

277
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,079
okay we have quite a few expired working

278
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,519
group documents

279
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,560
um but we have a few non-expired working

280
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,839
group documents um which are currently

281
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,760
being updated uh some of these are being

282
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,779
presented

283
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,700
um on the agenda today

284
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,200
I think generally we would probably like

285
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,459
to see

286
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,079
a higher proportion of the agenda

287
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,940
talking about how we're progressing the

288
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,040
existing working group documents that we

289
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,500
have we have a best seems to have a lot

290
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,720
of uh it's actually very healthy that we

291
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
have a lot of new work coming into the

292
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,100
working group but we do have a lot of uh

293
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,040
drafts that we we uh they're in a fairly

294
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,779
mature state that we probably need to

295
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,000
move forward as and and we'd like to get

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,700
some updates and maybe at the next ATF

297
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,100
um from the

298
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,480
editors of those drafts

299
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,519
okay any any other comments on the

300
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,360
working group status

301
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,480
I think

302
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,700
foreign

303
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,920
and I'll be presenting

304
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,160
updates on two working group drafts

305
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,760
uh the first one is RFC 7432 bis so this

306
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,339
is the update to the base 7432 draft

307
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,380
that we've been using in uh best free

308
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,519
VPN

309
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,399
uh this latest version has

310
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,560
um actually a fairly significant update

311
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,860
both editorial and towards content so I

312
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,139
thank both Sasha and Marek for their for

313
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,180
their comments thank you

314
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,279
um and we did quite a bit of rework to

315
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,220
include content from uh other drafts in

316
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,779
the working group to have them be part

317
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,660
of the new base 7432 bits

318
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,500
next slide

319
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,380
so the changes from O3 so I did not

320
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,899
present the changes in o4 but from since

321
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,160
O3

322
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,800
this draft now effectively creates in

323
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,740
the ESI extended Community label field

324
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,040
a Ina or request an Ina registry for

325
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,240
this field

326
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,220
previously this field was effectively

327
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,079
just defining the

328
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,720
um no flag present being all active load

329
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,160
balancing mode

330
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,760
and 7432 the base defends uh defines

331
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,740
sorry the single active mode with one

332
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,760
flag

333
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,760
but we found uh through I forget which

334
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,360
draft maybe prefdf or um

335
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,040
I forget which draft but we found that

336
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,380
updating this ESI field led to some

337
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,540
collisions

338
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,120
so effectively uh this draft now defines

339
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
an i and a registry for uh allocating

340
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,519
fields or bits in this

341
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,740
uh in this Flags field

342
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,220
the best path sections were updated both

343
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,260
from the default gateway which was in

344
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,459
1011

345
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,760
so they were taken from a a best pass

346
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,699
draft that existed in best

347
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,459
to to clearly Define or clearly order

348
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,220
the best path selection for evpn routes

349
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,800
uh and this the section currently covers

350
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,380
routes one to three

351
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,000
and

352
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,540
um

353
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,820
there was some question on the usage of

354
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,279
uh the usage of the label two field

355
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,680
which is effectively not defined uh the

356
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
usage of the label two field was not

357
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,880
defined in the draft and so uh there's a

358
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,220
reference to 9135 that is uh that is

359
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,959
added to the draft now

360
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,940
and apart from that uh just many

361
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,800
comments and um

362
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,139
significant editorial changes in between

363
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,779
all four and o5 actually

364
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,880
uh the next steps for this draft on the

365
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,639
next slide are

366
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,579
um we have received many reviews many

367
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,860
comments uh since it was first published

368
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,899
and even when it was first published the

369
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,220
the zero zero version of the draft

370
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,380
actually was based on

371
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,480
a plethora of comments on the bass draft

372
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,540
base 7432 so obviously more reviews and

373
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,040
more comments are always welcome but

374
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
this draft is nearing

375
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,660
uh working group last call stage so I

376
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,639
think we will be we will be ready to uh

377
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,300
to see class call on this draft

378
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,240
uh just to comment uh look uh I think if

379
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,980
I'm not mistaken you requested some

380
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,179
early allocation of cut point no

381
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,339
uh yes so I sent that email to Ayanna

382
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,740
and I think I see yeah either you or

383
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,040
yeah yes so so I did a pull to the

384
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,260
working group to see if there there was

385
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,059
anyone against the early allocation and

386
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,579
it was it was okay so I requested the

387
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,199
approval to Andrew but I haven't

388
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,600
received feedback yet so I will try to

389
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,240
pull Andrew again to give her his

390
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,940
approval before moving to Ayana okay

391
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,500
perfect thank you Stefan

392
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,820
the next draft I'm presenting

393
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,280
if there are another no other questions

394
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,980
is the is the evpn multi-homing for

395
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,600
layer 2 Gateway protocols so this is the

396
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,220
one that Stefan mentioned in one of his

397
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,720
slides for active working group

398
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,960
documents so we refreshed it

399
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,140
uh specifically in our case uh this evpn

400
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,760
multi-homing attributes registry that we

401
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,160
just uh that we just went over

402
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,080
so now there's a new load balancing mode

403
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,200
defined and instead of just allocating a

404
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,179
bit we now allocate an entry in this

405
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,640
load balancing registry or multi-homing

406
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
attribute registry

407
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,320
there was some comments received based

408
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,720
on clarifying the art procedures in the

409
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,400
in the draft

410
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,460
and so the diversion

411
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,500
um actually I think it's not O2 but the

412
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,179
version that's currently active I made

413
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,580
updates to explicitly reference

414
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,700
um 9135 so the irb-based our probing

415
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,020
procedures

416
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,320
uh but I have spoken to uh to the person

417
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,940
who made those comments due to Sasha

418
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,299
actually and he was actually seeking a a

419
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,160
reference to both our probing scenarios

420
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,020
right the IRB and the non-irb scenario

421
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,600
so I will include that use case of

422
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,299
non-irb in the next in the next update

423
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,919
and Define the art probing procedures

424
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,380
for non-irb

425
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,539
so other than that on the next slide

426
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,900
this draft has

427
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,860
matured quite a bit we have received

428
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,320
reviews and comments from many vendors

429
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,260
and operators actually so um

430
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,059
the there are implementations of this

431
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,400
draft it is in use so we would be

432
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,260
seeking working group Last Call on it

433
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,120
are there any questions

434
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,959
or comments

435
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,179
okay I don't see anyone in the queue

436
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,220
um so I think we're good okay thank you

437
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,700
thank you

438
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,539
so next up is Patrice

439
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,220
good morning my name is

440
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,919
um I'm here to talk about the evpn layer

441
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,320
3 multi-homing little balancing this is

442
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,460
a draft that

443
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,740
that came out about more than a year ago

444
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,000
and um so what we decided to do here is

445
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,760
to bring more calibrator collaboration

446
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,780
with

447
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,720
um or a and when for the other

448
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,940
um from Jennifer and Nokia

449
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,280
so I know for times constraint I may not

450
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,900
go through all the whole things but I

451
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
think what is really important is that

452
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,559
people start looking at it I think it's

453
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,840
it's a very good draft I explained very

454
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
well how the mechanics and how that

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,020
works

456
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,460
so can we go to the next slide please

457
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,020
all right so basically what we are

458
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,120
trying to achieve is it's exactly what

459
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,919
we what we have been designing for a

460
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,860
while in evpn but uh over LD interface

461
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,539
so you will see that we are taking care

462
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,120
of unicast multicast and a few of the

463
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,860
igp stuff

464
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,879
please next slide

465
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,539
so um so the mechanic also is

466
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:55,799
um you will see that whenever you're

467
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,039
going to read the draft is like we need

468
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,260
also to make sure that whenever the

469
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,760
synchronization is happening we can

470
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,559
refer to the right interface the right

471
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,780
Delta interface so all the mechanics has

472
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,820
been described there so in the new

473
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,620
version we put a bunch of clarification

474
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,780
to help the readers to understand how

475
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,820
that how this is working I think with

476
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,260
hurry and when we've done a very good

477
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,179
job on that please next

478
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,559
um this is pretty much the reptile that

479
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,480
are evicted and the use case that we are

480
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,740
covering

481
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,140
next one

482
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,840
and the beauty about this one is the

483
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,500
entire mechanics already exists so um

484
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,659
so it just pretty much explaining how we

485
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,179
use current mechanics to and get applied

486
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,600
for L3 interfaces

487
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,959
thanks

488
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,400
um yeah obviously we have a bunch of

489
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,799
advantages with that because uh what it

490
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,080
means then we are kind of going away

491
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,580
from direct ICI ICN link and the whole

492
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,820
Legacy mechanic

493
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,260
at Cisco we do have already this

494
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,960
solution being

495
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,100
being run on customers so

496
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,539
all right next

497
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,159
please

498
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,280
so please read it provide feedback and

499
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,899
we're going to move ahead of that

500
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,059
that's it thank you thanks any any

501
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,440
comments I don't see anyone in the

502
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,140
online queue

503
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,100
nope

504
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,580
thank you

505
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,500
okay I think you're

506
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,220
okay um yeah I have a short review of

507
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,100
three drafts here the first one is the

508
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,159
evpn vpws Gateway zero one presenting

509
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,780
this on behalf of my

510
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,140
friends from uh Nokia Junior Francisco

511
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,200
uh we presented this uh this draft

512
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,980
um uh to iets ago and uh I think now

513
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,200
it's uh

514
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,260
uh much more stable and better in this

515
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,419
next slide please

516
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:22,919
yeah I'm going to talk about a short

517
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,960
refresh changes that we've made in

518
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,900
version zero one and next steps

519
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,020
next slide please

520
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,820
the uh the draft

521
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,440
um in the introduction talks about

522
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,840
different ways of uh having

523
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,960
interconnectivity across domains for

524
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
evpm vpws services

525
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
it talks about three different solutions

526
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,059
which are all perfectly valid uh and

527
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,919
depending on the requirements you should

528
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,740
go to one or the other but if you have

529
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,900
the requirements that are listed here in

530
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,020
this table uh probably the best solution

531
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,419
is this service interworking uh spec

532
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,799
that we are

533
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,620
um we're specifying here

534
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,440
and uh there was nothing about it in the

535
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,480
in the best working group so that's why

536
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,179
we we needed to produce this document uh

537
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,900
next slide please

538
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,600
so the the draft is basically all about

539
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,539
uh making the water routers across you

540
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,520
know connecting different domains making

541
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,940
them uh service gateways

542
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,820
and in the draft we talk about

543
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,440
redistribution of the routes of the ad

544
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
per evi routes

545
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,559
and even though uh you know raw

546
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,059
distribution May mean different things

547
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,000
for different people so it's good to uh

548
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,380
to understand what it means in this

549
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,080
draft in the context of this document

550
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,419
so what we mean by that is when we

551
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,179
receive on a border router or a service

552
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,059
Gateway we receive an ad per Eva route

553
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,299
we process it according to the existing

554
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,720
RFC 8214

555
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,940
we also understand now the the d-path

556
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,240
attribute along with these routes as per

557
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,159
the d-path draft that I'm preferring

558
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,020
here in point a

559
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,419
we also need to program the forwarding

560
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:16,140
path uh based on the received route and

561
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,760
also based on the encapsulation of the

562
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,320
next domain

563
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,360
and uh and finally we need to

564
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,039
re-advertise the route to a different

565
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,340
domain this re-advertisement is really a

566
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,380
re-origination of the route meaning that

567
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,260
we can translate uh rewrite the route

568
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,000
the route distinguishers the ethernet

569
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
tag and and many other attributes in the

570
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,900
route

571
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,159
next slide please

572
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,140
as far as the redundancy is concerned we

573
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,720
defined two ways of doing it so the

574
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,940
first one uh here on the left hand side

575
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,159
is what we call the any gas gateways

576
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,480
redundancy

577
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,820
and this is a all about

578
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,640
um configuring uh exactly in the same

579
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,559
way the uh the service gateways that are

580
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,679
connecting to given domains right so

581
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,659
they when they redistribute the routes

582
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,360
they will do it with the same route

583
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
distinguisher the same ethernet tag and

584
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,900
everything

585
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,480
so the next four the routers or the peas

586
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,820
they rely on the pgp best selection to

587
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,700
pick up one of the the service gateways

588
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,100
the second way is a bit more

589
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,419
sophisticated

590
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,380
uh is Illustrated on the right hand side

591
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,500
and here basically uh each pair or uh

592
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,240
you know all their redundant service

593
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,740
gateways that are connecting two given

594
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,140
domains they are attached to what we

595
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,419
call an interconnect ethernet segment

596
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,100
the interconnect ethernet segment is

597
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,960
defined in RFC 9014 for Elan Services

598
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,419
here we are repurposing the same concept

599
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,419
for evpm vpws services

600
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,520
but other than that you have all the the

601
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,679
beauties of EVP and multi-homing so you

602
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,179
can Define the ethernet segment as a

603
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,159
single active or active you have all the

604
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,860
idea selection mechanisms Etc

605
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,799
uh next slide please

606
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,679
so the changes that we made in this

607
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,620
revision uh pretty much are these two

608
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,159
um we added support for fxc services so

609
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,120
you can also do this fxc Services across

610
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,820
different domains we updated references

611
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,179
in some other minor uh details next

612
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,360
slide please

613
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,480
so we already presented this draft it's

614
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,240
pretty much stabled and we believe it's

615
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,000
ready to uh work in group adoption so we

616
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,020
would like to request that

617
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,400
any questions

618
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,039
thanks

619
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,580
okay

620
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
um

621
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,960
all right next one is the vpnd bath

622
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,940
draft again presenting on behalf of my

623
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,240
friends from Nokia system Juniper next

624
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,779
slide please

625
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,460
uh I'll talk about a short refresh

626
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,740
what's new in this version and next

627
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,600
steps next slide please

628
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,120
yeah so what we are doing here with this

629
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,480
draft is we take the d-path attribute

630
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,059
that we talked about before

631
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:30,840
um

632
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,299
that is defined in the evpn and ipvp and

633
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,400
interworking draft the initially the

634
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,559
attribute was only for layer 3 routes

635
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,880
route type five any VPN or ipvpn routes

636
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,880
here we are using it for layer 2 evpn

637
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,120
routes right and we want to use d-path

638
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,360
for two purposes here to provide some

639
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,279
Loop detection

640
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,000
and therefore protection as well

641
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
specifically on service gateways

642
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,240
that are following IFC 9014 but we also

643
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,059
want to use it so that the uh the PE is

644
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,820
receiving the evpn layer 2 routes can

645
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,640
see the t-path and uh and Trace the uh

646
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,679
all the gateways through which the route

647
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,600
has gone

648
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,659
and uh there is also we use it

649
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,340
um you know in case the d-pad has

650
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,200
different length we also use it for

651
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,480
modifying the best path selection for

652
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,000
evpn layer 2 routes

653
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,899
next slide please

654
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,720
a simple example would be what you have

655
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,820
here in the in the diagram let's say you

656
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,260
have two data center gateways

657
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,200
interconnecting two domains and they are

658
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,960
attached to the same broadcast domain

659
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,980
so the two data center Gateway uh they

660
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,740
receive a given Mac IP route from uh

661
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,100
from ipe they redistribute that route

662
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,380
into the other domain and of course uh

663
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,360
the the two redundant data center

664
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,100
gateways they receive each other's

665
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,779
routes

666
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,940
but the the nice thing now is that when

667
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,980
they redistribute into the other domain

668
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,740
they slap the d-path with the identifier

669
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,740
of the domain of origin so now for

670
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,600
instance data center Gateway One when it

671
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,039
receives the Mac route

672
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,740
identifies that is coming from domain

673
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,860
1.1 which is a locally configured domain

674
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,399
so it can actually decide not to install

675
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,440
the route because it has a better route

676
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,320
coming directly from the PE

677
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,080
now the other advantage of this model is

678
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,039
uh for whatever reason if data center

679
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:37,260
data center Gateway One loses the route

680
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,600
coming directly from the PE

681
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,140
it has already another route that is

682
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,520
actually advertised from data center

683
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,340
gateway2 so you can do this U-turn thing

684
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,039
and provide the fast convergence for

685
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,440
in-flight packets

686
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,899
next slide please

687
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,240
another example that we have in the uh

688
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,779
in the draft is for imet routes for for

689
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,059
inclusive multicast ethernet Tech routes

690
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,980
or routes type 3.

691
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,480
same thing you can have gateways

692
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,299
interconnecting domains for uh in the

693
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,260
same broadcast domain so they both uh

694
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,059
exchange uh iMed routes in different

695
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,440
domains

696
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,539
so normally you would need to avoid

697
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,120
somehow manually to avoid the the two

698
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,520
parallel links to be created in both

699
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,799
domains to avoid packet duplication

700
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,700
debuff provides an automated way to to

701
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,059
do that basically you would tag the

702
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,039
diamond routes in one of the domains

703
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,399
with uh with the d-path uh domain and

704
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,020
that would be enough for the gateways to

705
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,179
modify the best pass selection and pick

706
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,980
up only one

707
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,059
next slide please

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,179
so what is new in this version zero two

709
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,120
um basically we modified this section

710
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,000
about best path selection for routes

711
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,460
type uh one two and three

712
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,840
now it's aligned with the with 7432 bits

713
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,980
that Luke was talking about before

714
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,740
we only modify that section of 74 C2

715
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,080
based in this draft with uh including

716
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,419
d-path for the best pass selection of uh

717
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,720
of these evpn layer 2 routes

718
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,440
we are also clarifying uh what happens

719
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,240
if you have on the on the service

720
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,120
gateways that are following the 9014

721
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,980
procedures and they have a interconnect

722
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,100
internet segments how you deal with the

723
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,100
ESI and the d-path because both could be

724
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,279
used to to detect Loops so we are

725
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,960
clarifying that in the draft

726
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,240
and some other minor changes

727
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,320
next slide please

728
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,960
again so this is uh version zero two uh

729
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,260
We've presented this uh several times so

730
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,480
we believe it's ready for working group

731
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,980
adoption

732
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,200
and but of course in the meantime we we

733
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,760
welcome any feedback

734
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,240
so thank you

735
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,178
thank you

736
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,860
Jorge thank you for the nice

737
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,220
presentation

738
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,340
do I understand the draft correctly that

739
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,620
all of the changes that you're

740
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,479
suggesting are within a single as

741
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,779
uh independent I would say in the same

742
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,159
way that RFC 9014 does not specify if if

743
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,100
the gateways are connecting domains

744
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,519
within the same as or not I I would

745
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,100
suggest my same comments from the deep

746
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,679
path if you're in a single domain you

747
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,740
need to put an exception 444

748
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,500
for the route reflectors if you're not

749
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,059
retaining the same

750
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,220
consistency if you're between domains

751
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,779
you should explain what the error

752
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,460
handling is there

753
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,460
just this and if I'm unclear I can take

754
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,620
it offline or do if you want me to

755
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,720
answer it here I can

756
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,659
yeah we we can we can certainly do that

757
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,040
the my only comment would be that uh RFC

758
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,839
19014 is one example uh that it's

759
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,060
already noticed in the that centers was

760
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,879
not written there right but yeah we can

761
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,099
do that if it happens I I would suggest

762
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,020
that addition

763
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,219
um I would suggest uh nine 90 14 bits

764
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,280
but let's just go on and suggest it

765
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,540
Filipino so there are some other

766
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,839
documents following kind of the same

767
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,859
architecture so

768
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,980
let's agree to disagree on the past and

769
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,560
go forward if that's my suggestion going

770
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,179
forward sounds good thank you

771
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,158
any other questions uh questions

772
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,380
okay so um one more this is about

773
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,500
um multicast forwarding for evpn to EVP

774
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,820
and gateways uh or eggs

775
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,700
um this is a new work and it's pretty

776
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,619
much based on some gaps that we

777
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,380
identified in in the different EVP

778
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,140
multicast drafts so I'm presenting this

779
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,079
on behalf of a bunch of people from

780
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,700
Nokia Arista and Juniper

781
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,339
uh next slide please

782
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,500
so I'll talk about introduction some

783
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,440
procedures and next steps next slide

784
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
please

785
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,400
all right so why why are we doing this

786
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,680
um there are two parts

787
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,079
um and again we'll we'll be talking here

788
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,119
about service gateways

789
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,740
and what I mean by that is you have

790
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,380
multiple domains and you have a service

791
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,960
gateways interconnecting those domains

792
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,420
it can be uh for Layer Two services or

793
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,040
layer 3 services

794
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,420
let's talk about Layer Two Services

795
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,040
first

796
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,960
so we know that we have RFC 9251 that is

797
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,940
defined in item pmld proxy in the

798
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,359
context of evpn in a single evpn and

799
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,220
broadcast domain

800
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,800
we also have

801
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,720
949014 which is defining uh the service

802
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,839
Gateway connectivity uh for Unique ass

803
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,520
and for bomb traffic

804
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,160
but not for IP multicast

805
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,560
because of of that basically

806
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,160
um

807
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,859
the the equation that came up is how how

808
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,440
do we interconnect two or more evpn

809
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,200
domains with uh you know gateways

810
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,619
following 9014

811
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,740
when uh the piece in in the domains

812
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,400
basically support the igmp MLD proxy VPN

813
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,079
procedures right

814
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,300
that was not defined anywhere so we

815
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,700
needed a place to do it

816
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,200
similarly for layer 3 we have the evpn

817
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,240
at pvpn interworking draft which defines

818
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,060
service gateways capabilities for IP

819
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,920
unicast traffic

820
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,420
we also have the oism draft or the IRB

821
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,859
multicast draft

822
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:24,079
that is defining how to bridge and Route

823
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,780
multicast with evpm procedures

824
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,940
that graph is actually defined in

825
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,720
service gateways between oism and team

826
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,060
Pim or mvpn

827
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,480
but the question is uh

828
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,560
we are missing a place where we specify

829
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,480
what happens if you have two evpn layer

830
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,240
three domains and you want to forward IP

831
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,160
multicast between them that was not

832
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,260
specified anywhere

833
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,960
so result of that we uh we thought it

834
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,180
was needed this uh we needed this

835
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,680
document so next slide please

836
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,960
so the document has two distinct parts

837
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,599
so one for Layer Two another one for

838
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,040
layer three

839
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,160
so if we talk about layer 2 first

840
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,160
the diagram is um it's an illustration

841
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,619
that is also included in the draft and

842
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,200
uh you can see that there are uh two

843
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,140
evpn domains right

844
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,240
uh all the piece and gateways are

845
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,980
attached to the same broadcast domain

846
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,520
right the gateways in between they are

847
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,280
connecting those to evpn domains

848
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,980
here in the example we have uh we assume

849
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,280
that one domain is uh is using vx9

850
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,320
encapsulation and the other one is mpls

851
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,560
or SRM TLs but any other two

852
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,680
encapsulations would be also valid

853
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,720
so what we are doing here is we assume

854
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,359
that the gateways are following the

855
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:53,640
c9014 procedures for for unicast and

856
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,859
bump including the interconnected

857
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,420
terminal segment

858
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,000
uh what we are extending here is that

859
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,579
now the gateways they import the sment

860
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,260
routes or the selective multicast

861
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,000
ethernet tank routes coming from the

862
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,079
piece

863
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,780
and they perform what we call a proxy

864
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,560
function of those estimate routes right

865
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,160
when you'd use when you use redundancy

866
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,420
in the interconnect internet segment

867
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,839
there is a DF and a non-df so we

868
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,900
mandated EF to do the proxy function of

869
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,660
the esmet routes there is an option too

870
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,599
if you wanted to to provide a faster

871
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,480
convergence in case of a failure there

872
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,180
is an option for the non-df to also do

873
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,099
the proxy function of the azmet routes

874
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,560
that is also allowed

875
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,440
and when you do that basically uh there

876
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,300
is a risk of a control plane Loop for

877
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,619
the estimate routes between the

878
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,020
Redundant gateways that's why we also

879
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,480
introduce the t-path for the s-met

880
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,040
routes

881
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,200
in the data plane there are no

882
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,359
extensions here so basically the non-df

883
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,460
will block the Ingress and Ingress

884
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,640
multicast as per the RFC 9014

885
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,160
and the draft also supports local

886
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,320
receivers and sources on the service

887
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,579
gateways

888
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,420
next slide please

889
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,640
um similar thing but now the service

890
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,280
gateways are layer 3 so you have an IP

891
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,200
verf instantiated

892
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,900
uh it follows pretty much the procedures

893
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,900
of the oism draft

894
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,540
the only extensions here is that since

895
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,180
there are two oism domains

896
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,119
the the draft talks or explains the

897
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,359
procedures using two sbds instead of one

898
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,160
SBD the usbd is the supplementary

899
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,020
broadcast domain that is defined in the

900
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,780
oism draft only that here we are using

901
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,079
two per ipverf

902
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,000
now it's uh it's important to mention

903
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,480
that the draft also says that if the

904
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,480
gateways are able to perform the all the

905
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,780
procedures with uh with a single SBD in

906
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,760
other words if the behavior in the on

907
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,160
the wires is the same as the the ones

908
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,680
you know explained in the draft

909
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,560
if the implementation uses only one SBD

910
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,660
that's perfectly compliant with the

911
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,899
draft

912
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,920
um there is uh there is also here we

913
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,200
Define one more flag for the multicast

914
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,240
texts and the communities uh that is

915
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,940
exchanged by the gateways on the iMed

916
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,160
routes for the SBD and based on that

917
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,260
there is a Dr election or a designated

918
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,079
router election so the Dr in this

919
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,200
context is the the one in charge of uh

920
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,079
doing the proxy function similar to the

921
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,300
the layer 2 case for the estimate routes

922
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,140
between domains

923
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,940
um yeah we also support her uh here's

924
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,700
local uh receivers and sources on the on

925
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,619
the service gateways uh next slide

926
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,800
please

927
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,859
it's a first version so of course we are

928
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,380
very interested in uh in feedback from

929
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,260
the working group

930
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,060
and that's it

931
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,720
any questions

932
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,240
all right thank you

933
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,959
okay thank you

934
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,099
Greg thank you

935
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,460
first step

936
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,060
hello I'm presenting on behalf of my

937
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,320
co-authors

938
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,380
um so this is an update uh to our draft

939
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,140
and advertising applicability of sbfd in

940
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,020
um multi-homed P domain and four inter

941
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,119
area next one at least

942
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,540
okay so I was invited and I was happy to

943
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,440
join as a coffer and uh we worked in

944
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,900
updated scenario descriptions uh next

945
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,520
slide please

946
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,099
so the BFD is uh well known and

947
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,579
established method of uh uh fast

948
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,560
detection of faults but uh it does bear

949
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,700
uh some extra operational

950
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,640
uh work that requires provisioning of

951
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,040
BFD sessions uh sbfd overcomes uh some

952
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,079
of this uh operational aspects uh but uh

953
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,480
just to simplify it

954
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,359
um does require their

955
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:40,140
uh information about the IP address of

956
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:44,579
their reflector sbfd reflector and the

957
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,640
discriminator that this um

958
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,079
reflector

959
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:49,859
um

960
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:55,260
allocates for sbfd session or sessions

961
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,220
um so

962
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,460
um the rfcs already established

963
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,660
um extensions to igp to edit for uh

964
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,000
systems to advertise their uh be sbfd

965
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,060
discriminators so uh this document uh

966
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,280
extends this functionality

967
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,599
uh into bgp next slide

968
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,720
for inter and intra area

969
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,220
uh scenario so this is uh scenario one

970
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,140
uh so as you can see

971
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:32,339
so the idea is that you have a service

972
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:36,359
CE uh double uh home uh with their uh

973
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:42,440
service please and uh then uh their

974
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,760
set of

975
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,480
um

976
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,740
access piece the idea is that uh service

977
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,619
B advertises its

978
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,940
um the discriminator so that xsps can

979
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,060
monitor uh this

980
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,119
um

981
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,140
a service six uh

982
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,980
locator

983
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,720
any questions about the scenario

984
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,900
okay next slide please

985
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,319
uh so uh scenario two is similar again

986
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,780
we have uh double homed

987
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,920
um service C and then uh service PES

988
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,480
advertise

989
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,540
um

990
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,920
um as B of D

991
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,460
um extension uh with the discriminator

992
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:42,359
and the source IP address and so the

993
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:45,599
access piece can monitor their um

994
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,579
status of their connection and the PE

995
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:54,000
because understandably uh in sbfd you

996
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,099
cannot differentiate whether it's a path

997
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,400
failure or not failure so you need to

998
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,760
have uh integral view in it basically

999
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,020
fall over and then uh separately do

1000
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,920
um

1001
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,579
fault localization and restoration but

1002
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:14,940
at least because it's redundancy so

1003
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,060
there is this uh architecture allows you

1004
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,579
for the fast detection and fast fell

1005
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,140
over

1006
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,400
next slide please

1007
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,560
so what's been used uh the bin used the

1008
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,960
BFD discriminator that is defined in RFC

1009
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,460
9026 so this is was case uh for uh point

1010
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,180
to point uh BFD mode so in this document

1011
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,560
we propose uh two new values for uh BFD

1012
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,740
mode parameter uh one of them is to

1013
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,980
detect a service 6 locator prefix and

1014
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,720
another one is to um

1015
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,119
uh

1016
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,579
um

1017
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:04,200
next hop

1018
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,619
um locator in both cases

1019
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,520
um

1020
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,520
optional Tov carries the source IP

1021
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,960
address so that uh the receiver of this

1022
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,680
um

1023
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,079
that attribute can understand what case

1024
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,920
is uh being tested and uh next slide

1025
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,099
please

1026
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,960
so here's um

1027
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,859
basically what each of the actors in uh

1028
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:39,599
in this process does so as BFD reflector

1029
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,319
um

1030
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,560
uses BFD discriminator attribute to

1031
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,980
advertise uh my discriminator uh value

1032
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,740
and um

1033
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,460
IP Source address to V to advertise is

1034
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,859
an address so the

1035
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,680
um expected sbfd initiator upon

1036
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,300
receiving

1037
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,460
um the the discriminator path attribute

1038
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,460
can analyze whether it's a type 1 or

1039
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,960
it's type 2 user scenario

1040
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,680
and start

1041
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,579
sending periodic uh BFD control messages

1042
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:23,359
so that when they're

1043
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,200
in our case uh service B receives it it

1044
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,480
um sends it back

1045
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,740
um and um

1046
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,700
so their access uh D is capable of

1047
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,480
monitoring the path and uh status of

1048
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,000
given

1049
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
service B and then if there is a failure

1050
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,980
then switch over to a redundant

1051
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,200
destination

1052
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,339
next slide please

1053
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,640
so with that we welcome comments and

1054
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,520
discussions and we think that the draft

1055
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,500
is uh uh stable and uh and currently ask

1056
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,660
you for consider working group adoption

1057
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,099
okay Castle is in the queue

1058
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,160
um

1059
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,540
but I don't see an on meet

1060
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,040
so Greg I understand this is the BFD uh

1061
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,380
discriminator attribute uh which is

1062
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,760
already existing

1063
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,099
and that's defined as an optional

1064
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:41,700
transitive attribute uh in the RFC where

1065
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,800
it was introduced it was applicable for

1066
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,700
mvpn uh but my understanding that your

1067
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,300
ex expanding its use

1068
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:54,359
to probably all other uh office as well

1069
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,220
here

1070
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,160
yes correct actually uh

1071
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,540
okay

1072
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,319
um

1073
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,839
going back to the original RFC in

1074
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,180
discussion uh that we had

1075
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,480
um and now can better appreciate their

1076
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,000
uh suggestions from Jeff

1077
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,020
um uh to make it uh more generic so now

1078
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,900
uh and you are right and the scenario

1079
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,180
that being covered in original RFC for

1080
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,560
point to multipoint was different

1081
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,240
because then

1082
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,619
um for point to multi-point BFD it is uh

1083
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:31,440
their head end advertises its uh

1084
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,200
discriminator value so informing the

1085
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,319
leaves in this case yes we're using

1086
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:41,220
existing attribute but it's reverse so

1087
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,560
it's a reflector advertises

1088
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,620
discriminator value that it expects

1089
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,099
[Music]

1090
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:48,119
um

1091
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,119
Ingress or

1092
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,540
packets BFD control uh messages to

1093
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,559
descend it with uh and use this value as

1094
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,220
your discriminator so that reflector uh

1095
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,559
the multiplexes them

1096
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,099
right so uh that's what I understood as

1097
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:12,420
well uh so uh my concern here is that uh

1098
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,180
this is an optional transitive and I

1099
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,460
know uh probably you may be aware or not

1100
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,500
but there has been discussion in the IDR

1101
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,380
working group about these attributes

1102
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,720
going uh I mean and in your example

1103
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,900
pictures uh you showed about Crossing as

1104
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,260
borders right yes so I think uh you

1105
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,619
might want to uh check on this uh with

1106
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,480
that in the idea working group to get

1107
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,119
inputs on how to prevent this

1108
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,520
information from leaking out especially

1109
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,020
because this also applies to every uh uh

1110
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,720
everyone right so I I just wanted to

1111
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,700
bring that up here

1112
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,220
okay thank you for your comment and

1113
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,339
suggestion definitely will uh educate

1114
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:59,579
ourselves on that and uh

1115
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:02,280
um bring it more probably more we'll

1116
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,220
welcome more expertise with from RDR and

1117
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,980
I guess we have Jeff

1118
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,140
ready to comment

1119
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,880
Jeff for you specifically addressing

1120
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,440
this idea comment okay I'll let you go

1121
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,339
ahead of going there okay Jeff has uh so

1122
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:20,040
keitans made the point excellently the

1123
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,160
thing the general advice idea I would

1124
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,619
give and a number of these issues is

1125
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,900
if the attribute gets attached to

1126
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,579
something that can leak into general

1127
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,520
internet or other context what bad

1128
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,760
things can happen so framing this

1129
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,920
specific issue here do you really want

1130
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,540
the outside rule to have your BFD

1131
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,940
discriminators and you know this what

1132
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,280
you're sort of telling people is uh you

1133
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,220
know spfd is a reflector technology

1134
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,140
reflector Technologies are used for

1135
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,140
reflector attacks so this is the danger

1136
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,839
of having you know a service like spfd

1137
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,420
which has no authentication for Echo

1138
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,359
being advertised the outside world

1139
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:03,300
certainly you can limit access to these

1140
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,339
Technologies through firewalls you can

1141
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:06,720
you know make sure your domains actually

1142
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,420
are filtering things appropriately but

1143
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,119
uh what you'd get is advice from the

1144
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,640
security ads is that this is inadvertent

1145
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,980
disclosure in some cases optional

1146
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,140
transitive is unfortunately very leaky

1147
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,260
for bgp and once you put it in there

1148
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,800
it's sort of hard to get rid of it so

1149
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,660
I'm not saying this is the wrong way

1150
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,240
that bgp would want to do this but we

1151
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,079
have to address the security

1152
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:35,099
considerations thank you and um actually

1153
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,260
um you pointing out and highlighting

1154
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,760
this uh security uh one of the um

1155
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,000
uh mechanism to mitigate security risk

1156
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
is a use of

1157
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,780
um Source IP address in BFD

1158
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,599
discriminator attribute so basically

1159
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,740
that gives uh the reflector way of uh

1160
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,040
verifying uh the source of BFD control

1161
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,980
messages and then uh protecting itself

1162
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,460
from uh service attacks right and that's

1163
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,000
great for control mode for spfd but for

1164
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,760
reflector mode I'm not personally aware

1165
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,140
of implementations that are quite that

1166
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,160
picky yet

1167
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,140
so this may move into you know

1168
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,280
additional security or considerations

1169
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,040
for spfd okay thank you

1170
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,000
okay uh

1171
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:27,839
yes

1172
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,460
um can you hear me

1173
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,720
yes

1174
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,819
yes so just a quick question you're in

1175
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,859
the drafted mention the evpn but I'm

1176
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:37,200
guessing this is also applicable to L3

1177
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,880
VPN

1178
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,380
or probably even mvpn as well

1179
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,500
thank you

1180
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,280
um

1181
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,700
can you repeat that actually well

1182
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,380
um we we well their assumption is that

1183
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,559
evpn is interpreted as a VPN with their

1184
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,400
uh bgp based control plane so if

1185
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:10,020
you're using bgp to to do control of

1186
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,020
their VPN then

1187
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,599
that

1188
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:17,220
technique will be applicable

1189
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,500
okay you think in the drafted mentions

1190
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,500
evpn so I would just mentioning that

1191
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,980
like maybe explicitly saying ipvpn or

1192
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,160
maybe even mvpn I guess just a variety

1193
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,640
of different um you know okay yeah I

1194
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,339
guess I see yes I might be that

1195
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:37,380
clarification would be helpful because

1196
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,740
uh you're right so basically that uh

1197
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,700
what's

1198
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,720
intended to be uh monitored as a

1199
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,140
destination is uh related to a service

1200
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,880
six

1201
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,359
um locator and the policy So yeah thank

1202
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:57,540
you for your suggestion we'll uh make

1203
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,559
the analysis and clarify uh the scope of

1204
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,040
this work okay so it's it's cut on an

1205
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,319
energy and then I've closed the queue

1206
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:09,059
because we need to move on

1207
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:12,240
uh yeah I just took Ketone here just a

1208
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,520
quick follow-up to Jeff's comments uh

1209
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,339
and I'm wondering whether uh approach

1210
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:21,420
that was used for uh the ELC V3 uh isn't

1211
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,099
that some kind of something that is

1212
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,980
needed in this case as well I'm not

1213
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,960
really sure if just putting things in

1214
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,960
the security considerations would be uh

1215
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,880
good enough

1216
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,760
I'm just wondering yeah

1217
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,700
okay uh I I guess that's something that

1218
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,460
we we need to talk with you as ideal

1219
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,599
experts so

1220
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,920
thank you

1221
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:52,859
from Hawaii uh firstly I think uh the

1222
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:55,559
motivation of this work is uh start from

1223
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,099
the srv6 service

1224
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:01,619
the spfd in that case well we also can

1225
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,319
generalize it to other related three

1226
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,440
vpns that is also possible we may add

1227
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,359
some clarification about this in this

1228
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,059
version and regarding the security or

1229
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:13,760
the the

1230
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,619
announcement scope of this feature

1231
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:20,540
actually if we use it with a VPN in the

1232
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,640
context.vpn the distribution of this

1233
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,680
attribute will be constrained together

1234
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,200
with the vaping rounds so I think that

1235
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,400
is also uh controllable for VPN service

1236
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,599
route right so I agree we can we need

1237
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,480
further discusses with IDR about the

1238
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,359
general cases yeah of course thank you

1239
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,440
okay thank you thanks

1240
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,520
so next is final

1241
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,259
thank you

1242
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,980
hello can you hear me

1243
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,540
yes we can hear you

1244
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,160
ah okay my name is

1245
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,440
here is a closer of this draft

1246
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,000
next next slide please

1247
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,920
uh this document was published before

1248
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,819
itf112 and a presented in item 113 and

1249
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:35,099
8114 and there is a long Suite of

1250
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:37,619
technical discussion on this document

1251
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:41,280
with Jeffrey so thanks generally for the

1252
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,400
discussion I was in the adoption and the

1253
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,319
review request to working group after uh

1254
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,020
itf114 but not replied too long

1255
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,720
so this time I will choose the main

1256
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,819
points of this document to present her

1257
00:58:56,819 --> 00:59:00,558
game next slide please

1258
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,760

00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:53,520
artists and sources of C martial UI to

1273
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,180
match against Rd and originator FC of

1274
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,000
the corresponding interest ad the

1275
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,700
problem is that the sources field of the

1276
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,819
cmatic housing AI is four bet one

1277

1278
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,180
originating IP in IPv6 influence

1279
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,119
function scenarios

1280
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,200
next slide please

1281
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,079
so here is the proposed solution

1282
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,859
for the propagating culture between

1283
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:27,240

1284
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,540
svr steel cultural C markets locating

1285
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,460
along with the reserved parts of the

1286
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,200
instrument sad Studio use Rd of

1287
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,880
cmaticals in our match against study of

1288
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,579
the corresponding interest ad the only

1289
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:43,740
modification is that the global

1290
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,799
administrator field of the IPv6 thematic

1291
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,799
has import RT is instead of sources

1292
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:52,740
field of simultaneous URI to match

1293
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,980
against the originated later IP of the

1294
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,380
corresponding interest ad

1295
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,140
all those IPv6 extend the community

1296
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,260
carry in the simultaneously include more

1297
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,240
than one

1298
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,700
IPv6 input artists there is only one

1299
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,099
which would will be used by the route

1300
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:13,200
key to import the corresponding

1301
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,900
schematic handle to its local where I

1302
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,680
have

1303
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,900
another only one IPv6 import RT has a

1304
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,700
characteristics that the local

1305
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,400
administrator field is non-zero which

1306
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,619
can be used by the procedure to

1307
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,839
distinguish it from the other input

1308
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:35,220
artists it should be loaded that in GTM

1309
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,799
scenarios the local administrator field

1310
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:41,220
on IPv6 in polarity used by root P to

1311
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,680
import the corresponding simultaneous

1312
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,240
root is also

1313
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,900
zero according to uh is also zero

1314
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,980
according to RC

1315
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,020
7761 so we suggest that the local

1316
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,720
administrator field of the activistics

1317
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,380
important GTM scenario is also filled

1318
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,440
with a Long Level value which are sent

1319
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,240
by root Shield through the way of

1320
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,079
importer RT carry the new image rules so

1321
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,299
in this document

1322
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:15,240
so the solution complies with the

1323
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,319
regular programming procedure in RC 6514

1324
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,720
with only a language modification to

1325
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,700
adapt the regular one to xv6 in

1326
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,500
restriction scenarios

1327
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,579
next slide please

1328
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:35,099
if there are only one root key for a

1329
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,079
specific grammatical Source the solution

1330
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:40,079
is in previous slides is enough

1331
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,900
here are the scenarios that a specific

1332
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,119
multiple Source smart home into multiple

1333
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,460
piece the long segment is the interior

1334
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:51,119
as C multiple root must be discussed for

1335
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,339
each individual root piece there are

1336
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:56,579
three options option one each root be

1337
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:59,339
configured with 16 Rd which is

1338
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:01,760

distinguisher

1354
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,079
next slide please

1355
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:57,720
in the process we will write it will

1356
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,220
reaching to fpv6 ipv4 and everything V6

1357
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,040
infrastructure stress will cause in

1358
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,260
providers Network

1359
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,200
the following figure is uh

1360
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,099
example is an example of pgp MLP enable

1361
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:18,000
Evolution to activate six ipv4 and IPv6

1362
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
power which sessions are established and

1363
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,400
the number of passes of this route will

1364
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,819
be doubled with each reflection

1365
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:30,319
next slide please

1366
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,900
so the solution is that to reduce BGC

1367
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,940
and whipping routes in parallel ipv4

1368
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,000
another IPv6 specification networks the

1369
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,160
firing action should be taken by a

1370
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,180
standard piece for interest iPhone

1371
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,280
message routes and the new 3D route if

1372
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,400
the originated root IPS address field in

1373
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,799
the root is filled with the iqv6 address

1374
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,480
is seen to the IPv6 laborers RS is

1375
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,799
signature ipv4 BB labels for inner as IP

1376
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:04,740
message root and Source active ad Roots

1377
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:08,280
is seen through both IPv6 VPC labels and

1378
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,579
ipu4pv labors for similar house rules if

1379
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:14,540
the IPv6 we have Roots importing

1380
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,099
external completely exists in the root

1381
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,339
is sent to ipvc exp neighbors otherwise

1382
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:24,180
it is seen to the ipv4 pdpc labels in

1383
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,960
the reflector routers the part of roots

1384
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,599
which are received from IPv6 speed label

1385
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:33,480
will be reflected to other IPv6 specific

1386
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,760
labels another other part of the route

1387
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,980
which are received from ipv4 bit of

1388
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,760
Labor will be reflected to other ipv4 PB

1389
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,260
labels

1390
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,520
next slide please

1391
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,799
uh so comments are welcome uh uh we are

1392
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,500
also seeking for working group adoption

1393
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,319
I think they used to described in the

1394
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,240
document is clear and the solution is

1395
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,440
very low

1396
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,619
as an adoption request after the last

1397
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:07,200
item meetings but the no response

1398
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,359
received so I request the key in this

1399
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,700
time and which is a working group could

1400
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,640
give some response it would be operation

1401
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,760
you can give some suggestion or point

1402
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,680
out the gaps for the adoption of this

1403
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,879
document thank you

1404
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,180
try to go ahead yeah Jeffrey Donald drop

1405
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,339
her down from juniper

1406
01:06:35,339 --> 01:06:37,859
um so indeed we have had some

1407
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,960
discussions on the marianist I don't

1408
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,819
think we have reached agreement on

1409
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,520
what's the best way to address this my

1410
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,619
understanding that you have three

1411
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:49,319
problems here in this script

1412
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,359
the first problem

1413
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,099
um there was another there's another

1414
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:55,799
solution another trapped which I

1415
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:58,079
presented in Las IHF as well and I

1416
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,200
requested for adoption that draft covers

1417
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
uh many

1418
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,038
issues and solutions for

1419
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:14,160
for symmetrical related issues and your

1420
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,619
second problem does not seem to be IPv6

1421
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:18,839
specific

1422
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:20,640
um so

1423
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,180
the the third one is indeed IPv6 uh

1424
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,180
specific and we was not covered in other

1425
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,220
drafts

1426
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,960
um but going forward what's uh best uh

1427
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,420
way I think we can we should discuss

1428
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,359
more but indeed uh I just want to

1429
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,420
mention that we also have requested for

1430
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,480
adoption for the other drafts and

1431
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,079
I have presented last time and also

1432
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,480
followed up with with the

1433
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,339
with the with the chairs with their

1434
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:55,079
adoption request

1435
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:56,760
thanks

1436
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,859
yeah we have a lot of adoption requests

1437
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:00,780
at the moment so if you could email the

1438
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,539
unicast the chairs

1439
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:05,220
um to best shows at least you have

1440
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,299
thought that would really help actually

1441
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:08,039
because I think just about every draft

1442
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:10,140
that gets presented or asking for

1443
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,299
working group adoption yeah I understand

1444
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,400
I understand we have a queue yes yeah

1445
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,839
thanks

1446
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,600
I'm sure we haven't missed anything

1447
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,859
okay

1448
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:21,238
thank you

1449
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:26,120
next is uh Swedish I think

1450
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,839
yeah hi I'm swadesh Agarwal from Cisco

1451
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:44,219
Systems

1452
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:45,719
uh

1453
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:50,160
this is a new draft uh this is for bgp

1454
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,319
extensions for srb6 and mpls

1455
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,899
interworking and I'm presenting on the

1456
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:59,120
behalf of my authors next slide please

1457
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,198
so there's a spring draft which

1458
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,319
describes the srv6 and MPS interworking

1459
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,839
architecture in the multi-domain network

1460
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:09,299
where each domain run srv6 and mpls

1461
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:12,540
independently and that document already

1462
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,479
had the bgp protocol extensions so what

1463
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:17,040
we are doing here is we are extracting

1464
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,859
the protocol extensions in this new

1465
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:22,560
draft and this is done to independently

1466
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,859
State bgp protocol requirements and the

1467
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,020
future applicability of them for the use

1468
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,100
cases

1469
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:32,060
next slide please

1470
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:35,040
so we Define a new tlv as it is called

1471
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,259
sr6 tunnel for label route

1472
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:40,920
uh with the this is carried in the bgp

1473
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,439
prefixed attribute to Signal the srv6

1474
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,839
Sid along with the mpls label bound to

1475
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:49,198
the bound to the prefix in the nlri

1476
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,238
so SRC terminal tunnel for the label

1477
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:54,540
route tlv signals and semantics that is

1478
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,100
push the

1479
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,520
a label signal in the nlri and perform H

1480
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,460
Dot N caps with the destination as a

1481
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:05,280
sr66 signal in this new tlv

1482
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,040
and this tlv is encoded exactly like

1483
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,160
srv6 services tlv in the prefixed

1484
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,980
attribute Define already defined in RFC

1485
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:17,100
9252 without transposition

1486
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,260
set Behavior which is uh currently

1487
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:23,159
defined for this uh tlv is a n dot DTM

1488
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:26,280
but in future new behaviors may come up

1489
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,860
next slide please

1490
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,159
this shows how this uh tlv is carried so

1491
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:36,360
we have a Services running from ah E 10

1492
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,699
to E1 which is I'm showing here VPN

1493
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:41,340
Services the VPN label and on one we

1494
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,520
need a reachability to E10 low back so

1495
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,940
it's at our left and the right domain

1496
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,219
are mpls and the middle domain is srv6

1497
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:52,800
so E10 doesn't know anything about a

1498
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,300
middle domain it's advertised the

1499
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,659
loopback in bgplu a regular one with the

1500
01:10:57,659 --> 01:11:00,120
prefix E10 implicitinal and the next top

1501
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,880
on the seven what we do these we

1502
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,500
allocate this set of DTM behavior and we

1503
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,260
carry that acid in the prefixed

1504
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:13,199
attribute of this new tlv type

1505
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,199
and as well as we carry the MPS label

1506
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:19,679
which is bound to the prefix a regularly

1507
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,179
like bgplu

1508
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:23,880
and the behavior is DTM and it is C by

1509
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,820
node 4 and 4 will do a next top cell and

1510
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,860
an advertise to E1 as a regular bgplu

1511
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,940
update so now when the packet which

1512
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:34,560
service traffic that comes on E1 would

1513
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,500
be it's a regular encapsulation with the

1514
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,940
ABR label and the bgplu label to E10 but

1515
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,860
on node 4 if you see what it's doing

1516
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,960
it's it's pushing both the it's doing a

1517
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,960
swap operation for uh label for the

1518
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,440
prefix for E10 that means 16010 as well

1519
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,060
as it's doing H dot end caps with the

1520
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,940
DTM behavior and for DTM Behavior which

1521
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,540
is defined in the spring graph it means

1522
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,980
decapsulation and lookup of look up the

1523
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,460
label uh below the header in the mpls

1524
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,699
table so that 16010 which is from the uh

1525
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,800
will carry the packet to the E10

1526
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,120
regularly next slide please

1527
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,280
so there's another another case we we

1528
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,800
need to advertise SRB succeed and in

1529
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,960
this case this as I've said is bound to

1530
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,540
the prefix in the nlri like mpls label

1531
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,600
this is a set for each uh prefix in the

1532
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,560
nlri

1533
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,500
it is carried in the Safi it's a loop uh

1534
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,380
this is this is of the DPM Behavior Uh

1535
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,800
and it's carried in Safi 4 uh R1

1536
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,980
I can go to next slide please

1537
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,560
so we can see what happens is it's

1538
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,199
exactly same scenario but uh we

1539
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,480
advertising E10 in bgplu which is

1540
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,060
received by the Note 7 but Note 7 here

1541
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:54,060
allocates both the label and srv6 set

1542
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,020
bound to the prefix that's important and

1543
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,940
this document extends the bgp prefixes

1544
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,440
attribute uh to carry the this this sit

1545
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,140
in the srv6 layer 3 Services tlb Define

1546
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:12,000
in RFC 9252 with rp12 and the Safi 4.

1547
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,580
tlv is encoded exactly like SRV services

1548
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,739
tlb in the prefixed attribute without

1549
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:18,719
transposition because we are carrying

1550
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,699
both the label and the SRV 68 so there

1551
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:22,560
is no transportation we can do

1552
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,020
such an update can be processed both by

1553
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,719
the Legacy mpls AVR that means 4 could

1554
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:30,179
be an srs6 capable or a legacy also both

1555
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:32,640
will take and do the do the relevant

1556
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,500
encapsulation next slide please

1557
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,880
another case is what can happen is 7

1558
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,060
only supports the srv6 Sid bound to the

1559
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,800
prefix so it's not allocating the label

1560
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,500
in this case since we can't use label as

1561
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,280
Safi 4 Safi 4 needle label so what we do

1562
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,640
is we use a Safi one and in that we it's

1563
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,100
already defined in nine to five RFC 9252

1564
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,940
to carry a sr6 sid for Safi one in the

1565
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,500
prefix it attribute we do exactly same

1566
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,540
procedures so there's nothing new it's

1567
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,159
just a use case showing how we can

1568
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:07,980
achieve uh in case we don't have a label

1569
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,780
in the on the border nodes of srv6

1570
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,340
domain

1571
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,780
next next slide please

1572
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:17,760
yeah so we will We would like working

1573
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,440
group to review and provide comments

1574
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,719
this is something which is already just

1575
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:23,640
a background this is already defined in

1576
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,960
the it was already defined in the spring

1577
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,060
document we just extracted here so it

1578
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,219
was there from last 10 versions here we

1579
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:30,540
are presenting in the best now a

1580
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,980
separate document

1581
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,580
thank you

1582
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,920
foreign did I understand right that you

1583
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,340
are expanding uh what was originally the

1584
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,560
bgp

1585
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,659
uh prefix for Sid

1586
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:57,239
just meant I'll get the RFC number if

1587
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:00,179
you are you should be presenting this in

1588
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:02,760
IDR because that's the original home on

1589
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,219
the draft

1590
01:15:04,219 --> 01:15:08,640
but although sr66 like for services we

1591
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,739
went in the best but if you wish I can

1592
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,600
present in the idea also it would be

1593
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,000
good also if it's a draft that you're

1594
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,600
modifying that's an rrc in IDR Swedish

1595
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,460
it'd be best to

1596
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,880
present it and get some feedback that

1597
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,840
way you get the the review uh that that

1598
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,080
from the original review sure it may be

1599
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,560
the same people but it could be helpful

1600
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,800
no problem

1601
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,659
um well thanks for presenting this here

1602
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:45,780
in best I think it was it was needed

1603
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,060
um I have just one question out of

1604
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:51,300
curiosity so for the DPM Behavior you

1605
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,179
have two cases uh either

1606
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:56,820
binding only their service six

1607
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:01,739
to the prefix or srv6 set plus the label

1608
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:05,520
I wonder so the latter is just for

1609
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,100
migration purposes and then the idea is

1610
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,260
to have the just the yeah so if you have

1611
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,719
a green field sr6 domain border routers

1612
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,400
may not be allocating the labels so

1613
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,840
that's the reason we gave that option

1614
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,420
but most likely the way we feel is for

1615
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,699
the migration cases we will use the Safi

1616
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:23,219
4 only in which we carry both the mpls

1617
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:26,159
label as well as the sr68 okay got it

1618
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,580
thank you

1619
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,520
any other comments

1620
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,360
thank you

1621
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:39,860
on your next

1622
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,980
sorry I'm trying to find

1623
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,659
hi can everyone hear me

1624
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:07,500
yep okay hi my name is Gian Mishra and

1625
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,440
I'm presenting this draft this uh four

1626
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,560
drafts on behalf of co-authors so the

1627
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,540
four drafts are

1628
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,880
um it's I I show the first two is

1629
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,120
related to the IPv6 only PE design so

1630
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,480
this is IPv6 only key design and then

1631
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,000
the second draft is a super set of the

1632
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,760
first draft and that's IPv6 OMP design

1633
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,600
all sappy uh the next few draft pair is

1634
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,920
the ipv4 only P design and then the um

1635
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,500
and then the all safety uh so I'll I'll

1636
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,719
be going over all four graphs in this

1637
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,239
presentation next slide

1638
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:47,419
foreign

1639
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:58,980
BCP it was adopted in April of 2021 uh

1640
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,199
so the folks of this draft is a proof of

1641
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,719
concept testing DCP for vendor

1642
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:05,820
implementations and operators uh

1643
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,940
deployment so with this the ipv is only

1644
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,840
PE design uh supports Safi one two and

1645
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,540
two uh it was then further updated to

1646
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:18,300
support one two and then Safi 128 and

1647
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,080
129 uh

1648
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,600
the ad users from IP Design This the the

1649
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,300
next draft uh which was mentioned about

1650
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,179
in the in the first slide is is called

1651
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:32,219
it's the IPv6 Olympic design but it's

1652
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:34,620
all sassy so it's extensible to all

1653
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,960
safety so we're taking the same concept

1654
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,179
that was applied then we're testing with

1655
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:41,580
it with with the vcp use case with the

1656
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,860
original set of staffies but now we're

1657
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,140
providing that extensibility with this

1658
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:49,199
new draft to support false happy so the

1659
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,000
force folks have just so this is

1660
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
basically a superset of the first draft

1661
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,800
uh and this one would be standards track

1662
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,280
uh so the goal of this draft is uh to

1663
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,380
focus on the P design change perspective

1664
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,199
and language related to there's a

1665
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,480
paradigm shift so what we're doing with

1666
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,219
both of these drafts is it's an

1667
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:12,000
alternative and and and a BCP as well as

1668
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,280
a new standard that whenever you have

1669
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,480
any type of p c e Peery or inner ASP to

1670
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,020
PE pairing then now you're able to

1671
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,020
use this new new uh Paradigm Shift

1672
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,300
option where you actually have a IPv6

1673
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:31,320
only PE so the PE would actually get all

1674
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,280
the uh NRA SP to P peers or PE to P

1675
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,340
peers they would it would be a single V6

1676
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,440
peer and you're you're being you would

1677
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,840
be able to carry it all safety

1678
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,640
um and you'd still be able to support

1679
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,179
both could both data planes so the V4 V6

1680
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:50,280
data plan are supported but now you

1681
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,420
don't have

1682
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,120
two sets of peers a set of V4 peers and

1683
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,400
aesthetic V6 peers so there's a

1684
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,500
tremendous capex and Apex savings as

1685
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,719
well as the big savings with V4 address

1686
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,820
depletion so that that's a really big

1687
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:06,799
one with um with this design

1688
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,460
um next slide

1689
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,880
so with this with this uh

1690
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,640
designed with the proof with the IPv6

1691
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,179
only P design and sorry with this with

1692
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:24,000
the ipv4 only I'm sorry iqv6 only PE

1693
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,600
design uh uh testing an update that we

1694
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,960
had is uh we're planning to complete all

1695
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,840
the tests the vendor testing so Cisco

1696
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,900
Juniper and Nokia were planning to

1697
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,880
complete by the end of this year that's

1698
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,260
really the Target that we're looking at

1699
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,679
uh all of the vendors support a vendor

1700
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,840
Pacific nav reporting ipv4 package

1701
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,120
without an ipv4 address so they all

1702
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,760
support that and that's that's uh that's

1703
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,820
a critical component of the testing

1704
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,120
um and Huawei is uh planning to complete

1705
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,360
by 2023. uh Aristo we don't have an ETA

1706
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,060
but right now we're we're we have a lot

1707
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,699
of focus on the first three uh trying to

1708
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,980
get that all completed uh by The End by

1709
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,960
the end of the year

1710
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,800
next slide

1711
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:18,179
so the ipv4 only PE design so uh from

1712
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:20,159
ietf 114

1713
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,540
um and I did mention it in the other

1714
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,520
side when I was going over the IPv6 only

1715
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,940
PD design but uh we we had some feedback

1716
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:29,580
from the working group uh during the uh

1717
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:33,719
itf-114 on combining drafts so in the

1718
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:36,300
slide that I I had just gone over with

1719
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,300
the IPv6 only PE design the first draft

1720
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:43,199
had been adopted uh but however the

1721
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,540
second draft is we're still progressing

1722
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,880
that draft and we're hoping for an

1723
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,199
adoption you know queuing up for

1724
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,659
adoption call uh however

1725
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:54,840
because they are because they've uh the

1726
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,179
first draft had already been adopted

1727
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:59,159
um our thoughts are actually the

1728
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,260
progressive separate the second draft

1729
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,659
separately and not combine the two

1730
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:05,640
drafts but we would like to see feedback

1731
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,679
from the working group

1732
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,840
um as well as chairs on combining those

1733
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,960
two drafts given that uh one draft has

1734
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,420
been adopted and the other draft is a

1735
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,460
new extensible drafty all safety draft

1736
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,980
and whether we can still whether it's

1737
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,900
possible to still combine those two

1738
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,659
drafts and it would save on Cycles on

1739
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:27,300
working through an adoption call so with

1740
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,460
this draft these both of these drafts

1741
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,219
are new drafts so what I've done is I've

1742
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:33,780
I have already combined from the

1743
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,540
feedback from ITF 114 I have combined

1744
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,760
both of these traps so the V6 only

1745
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,800
p-designed what I did was I took that

1746
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,500
draft and combined it into the new draft

1747
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,480
the all safety draft so now it's really

1748
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,880
this all sassy draft that we would be

1749
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,800
progressing forward that would be

1750
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,380
all-encompassing it would Encompass the

1751
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,600
the proof of concept testing that we

1752
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,800
would be doing

1753
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,640
with with the uh V4 LEP design with

1754
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,520
safety one two 128 129

1755
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,520
and then it would also Encompass all

1756
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,460
safies the extensibility as well as of

1757
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,679
the next top encoding so with this track

1758
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:13,020
it does have an Ina code Point

1759
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,159
allocation

1760
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:17,159
um for a update on next stop encoding

1761
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,600
and we'll go over that in the substitute

1762
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,860
slide next slide

1763
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:27,120
so so the IPv6 only P design and v4p

1764
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,120
design timelines and caveats so with

1765
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,380
this

1766
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:34,800
this is an important slide as I wanted

1767
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,100
to kind of key in on the timeline for

1768
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,980
testing as well as

1769
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:42,900
the staffies and what we'll be testing

1770
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,219
and then as well as the uh extensibility

1771
01:23:46,219 --> 01:23:48,840
uh to all the others happy and that's

1772
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,699
really one of the folks here just kind

1773
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:54,780
of making that clear so in in the in the

1774
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,420
IPv6 only P design so we will be testing

1775
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,060
safety one 128 and I have a typo there

1776
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:03,300
but Safi 1 128 and 129.

1777
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,800
um those are the three statues that are

1778
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,080
being tested for both the V4 and EP

1779
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,900
design and the V6 only be designed so

1780
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,699
that that's that's the folks what's

1781
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:14,400
being tested uh

1782
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,840
for the IP uh V6 only P design the

1783
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,980
extensibility so here actually I have a

1784
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,719
slight typo it's supposed to be igv6

1785
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,239
only feed design so the support for all

1786
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:31,080
safy the Paradigm Shift you know so that

1787
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,080
part of the draft we're providing the

1788
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,060
folks on the standardization and you

1789
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,219
know to support all staffy however we

1790
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:41,219
would not be testing any other safeties

1791
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:43,980
other than just the one once that's

1792
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,080
happening one 128 and 129 so I just

1793
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,820
wanted to make that clear

1794
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,860
um and then further testing related to

1795
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,320
the all safety is really uh deferred

1796
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,219
that as uh operator decide to deploy

1797
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:57,840
um staffies other than these first three

1798
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,120
staffies to support any of the other

1799
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,360
zafies that uh they can work with the

1800
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,580
vendors of their choice as they're as

1801
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:09,239
they're working to um test and deploy

1802
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:12,480
any of the other safeties uh you know

1803
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,280
that are that you know that that would

1804
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,860
be supported

1805
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,140
the IP existence only if you decide the

1806
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,640
plan is as I had mentioned in the other

1807
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,280
slide that we plan to complete by the

1808
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,760
end of the year and the ipv4 only PE

1809
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,100
design testing we plan to start after we

1810
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,320
finish the V6 only key design testing so

1811
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,780
we want to get the V6 only pizza and get

1812
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:36,659
that progressed uh to work with last

1813
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:39,239
call hopefully once we could get all the

1814
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:41,400
complete testing completed which which

1815
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,699
we're we're on track to complete the

1816
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:47,460
ipv4 only PE design

1817
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:50,280
so this one so the new so it's a new

1818
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:54,300
IPv6 that ipv is only feeds on it it

1819
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,719
involves a new Next Top encoding which

1820
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,520
we'll be testing

1821
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,980
using the existing next stop encoding so

1822
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:04,080
with this and we'll I have a slide that

1823
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,940
actually kind of really digs into this a

1824
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:09,360
little more detail but this this uh the

1825
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,340
IPv6 only if you designed so since it

1826
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,100
involves both a new next stop encoding

1827
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,020
but we have an existing F10 Next Top

1828
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:18,239
encoding what we would do is we would be

1829
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,940
following in in our testing we would be

1830
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,940
using what exists with the vendors so

1831
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:26,520
whether they're using an ipv4 mapped

1832
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,000
IPv6 address or an ipv store address so

1833
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,960
following the RFC 5549 or 8950 next up

1834
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,659
including style uh we wouldn't test that

1835
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:40,139
or if they support the map address uh we

1836
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:42,480
would we would test either option uh

1837
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,000
we'll work with each each of the um the

1838
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,800
vendor development teams to get their

1839
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,100
support and agreement on the change to

1840
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,639
the RFC 5549 89.50 next up including

1841
01:26:53,639 --> 01:26:56,639
style so that would be a four byte ipv4

1842
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,880
address for safety one two and four and

1843
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:04,080
then for Safi 128 129 the Rd plus the Rd

1844
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,300
field of eight bytes are you know set to

1845
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,520
zero a 12 byte next stop encoding

1846
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,860
standard so it'd be a V4 address four

1847
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,320
byte for one two and four and then 128

1848
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,900
and 129 it would be a 12 byte in total

1849
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,940
so including eight byte with an already

1850
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:20,880
zero so once each vendor has developed

1851
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,380
the new next stop and trading we would

1852
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,060
go through and test that new next

1853
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,920
happening encoding method and then

1854
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:31,219
progress the drafting of RC next slide

1855
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,739
please because your 10 minutes is up now

1856
01:27:34,739 --> 01:27:37,500
oh 10 minutes ago okay thank you so just

1857
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,760
just

1858
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,219
okay all right thank you um let's let's

1859
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:45,659
uh skip over to go down to um

1860
01:27:45,659 --> 01:27:48,679
skip to the next slide

1861
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,780
um

1862
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:54,540
yeah so I'm just gonna just Breeze

1863
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,400
through a couple of these slides so in

1864
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,980
this slide we talked about the ipv4 on

1865
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:01,440
AP exide so in this slide we're it's a

1866
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,540
V4 address but basically all the

1867
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:05,699
semantics of an actual dual stacking

1868
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:07,739
this is providing a alternative to

1869
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:11,400
existing uh existing uh dual stacking

1870
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,139
but now you have a V6 address but all

1871
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:16,380
normal functionality that exists with uh

1872
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,179
with your peering would still would

1873
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:20,159
still be the same the V4 V6 forwarding

1874
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,020
everything that would normally happen on

1875
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:25,440
a uh V4 Next Top the IPv6 only P design

1876
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,139
is exactly is a similar alternative to a

1877
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:30,540
dual stack pairing but now you know

1878
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:32,820
supporting all the same functionality

1879
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,080
that you would normally have a dual

1880
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,120
stacking but now without that before

1881
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,040
address configured

1882
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,880
um next next slide

1883
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,820
um

1884
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:47,940
so in this slide I wanted to um go over

1885
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:50,639
the next top encoding so with the next

1886
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,940
top encoding So currently today there is

1887
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:56,100
a where that with the IPv6 next Saturday

1888
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,440
next up encoding standardization change

1889
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,020
that that we're proposing in in this

1890
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:04,440
draft so today you either have a itv4

1891
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,500
mapped IPv6 address or there may be

1892
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:11,580
cases where you have a AIP ipv4 address

1893
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,940
so similar to the RFC 5549 or 8950 next

1894
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,940
top encoding so what this draft is

1895
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,100
supposed to do is really is really to

1896
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,020
standardize that next hop encoding that

1897
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:26,699
he uses a ipv4 address and not a mapped

1898
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:29,760
address and that's a goal and

1899
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,800
again just sorry we've got about 30

1900
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,380
seconds till we we would start that we

1901
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:37,860
would uh in silence so okay

1902
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,840
um yeah maybe maybe just pause here and

1903
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,460
then we'll take questions after the two

1904
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,540
minutes okay great thank you very good a

1905
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,880
few seconds to go

1906
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,500
all right I'm just I'm gonna wrap up and

1907
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,020
then I'll I'll take questions

1908
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,960
um I'll go ahead and so so basically in

1909
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,540
this in this slide it's like two seconds

1910
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:00,620
to go now so uh okay

1911
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,060
I'll go ahead and take questions now so

1912
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:07,219
thank you afterwards yeah thanks

1913
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:24,840
I think there's two people in the queue

1914
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,639
does anyone have any questions they want

1915
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,820
to ask

1916
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:37,980
captain or or it's I see two people in

1917
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,360
the queue

1918
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,719
well I can go with kitten is not

1919
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,199
does not want to go

1920
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:49,219
so I think this is a pretty good set of

1921
01:30:49,219 --> 01:30:52,380
drafts and it's interesting to see them

1922
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,780
progressing

1923
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,820
um the

1924
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:00,179
I have one thing that I want to

1925
01:31:00,179 --> 01:31:02,219
want you to look at and that's really

1926
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:04,860
the abstract

1927
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,139
um most of the time when people write

1928
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:10,440
apps right they are too abstract so the

1929
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,100
section doesn't stay much more than

1930
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,320
um what the title says

1931
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,719
I think you are making the opposite

1932
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,000
mistake you are

1933
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,120
way too detailed and my suggestion would

1934
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,280
actually be to move the current upset

1935
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,219
into the introduction and then write a

1936
01:31:29,219 --> 01:31:34,199
10 15 line abstract per draft on a level

1937
01:31:34,199 --> 01:31:36,719
level that

1938
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,400
a technical

1939
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,080
uh Advanced person couldn't understand

1940
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:48,120
uh I think you should look at RC 7322

1941
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,239
uh for guiding on how to how to write

1942
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:54,179
abstracts thank you

1943
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:57,500
thanks Laura thank you

1944
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:02,760
all right

1945
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,480
thank you

1946
01:32:19,739 --> 01:32:22,459
uh

1947
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,139
period was up

1948
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:23,639
because the clocks may not be

1949
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:27,679
synchronized can you hear me

1950
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:29,770
hello

1951
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,560

1952
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:35,900
yes we can hear you okay

1953
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,560

uh

1955
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,320
I missed the announcement that the

1956
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,699
period was over

1957
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:41,880
um but uh I'll send it over the email

1958
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,540
thank you

1959
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,480

so I will start my presentation now

1965
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,760
hi everyone I'm Sue from Huawei and Mike

1966
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,800
my concert is phone home who is also

1967
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,199
from Hawaii too

1968
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:40,040
um yes

1969
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:44,639
so today I'm glad to present my new

1970
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:47,400
version draft about the mvpn Upstream

1971
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,980
designated for the selection

1972
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:53,360
next slide please

1973
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:59,599
next slide please

1974
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,580
hello

1975
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:09,679
boom cannot hear us and yeah

1976
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,300
[Music]

1977
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,560
okay

1978
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,480
um so next slide please

1979
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,139
so was it two minutes or five minutes no

1980
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:30,480
no no no no no no I I think kittens that

1981
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,040
there is an audio issue with the room

1982
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,280
now

1983
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:36,840
so Matthew I don't know if Matthew is

1984
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,480
unable to uh to hear us and we also

1985
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,460
count irim

1986
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:44,120
okay

1987
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,380
so they are currently checking uh if

1988
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:52,280
there is something going wrong

1989
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,109
[Music]

1990
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,840
okay let's let's wait to see if we can

1991
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,199
fix it

1992
01:37:28,739 --> 01:37:30,840
oh hi

1993
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,239
um maybe I need to check and not just

1994
01:37:33,239 --> 01:37:35,460
check my network and switch another

1995
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:38,460
laptop so can I speak later after the

1996
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,620
next president no it's not it's not

1997
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:43,020
coming from you it's really coming from

1998
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:46,560
uh from the London location

1999
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,820
a London location yeah yeah so I I think

2000
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:52,560
it's okay for everybody who are remote

2001
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,199
but uh but the local guys are are not

2002
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:57,540
able to hear us and we are not able to

2003
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,960
uh together

2004
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,719
it's it's a problem in London

2005
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:04,580
yeah

2006
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:07,440
now we can hear you Matthew can you hear

2007
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,620
us

2008
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:15,780
Okay so

2009
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,900
okay so Matthew is telling that we will

2010
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,159
do

2011
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:25,500
okay so we'll do in person first and

2012
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,520
then catch up with remote

2013
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,040
Play Just displayed his presentation so

2014
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,159
maybe I can use his laptop to try again

2015
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:43,638
later

2016
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:54,780
cover the design scenarios

2017
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:58,580
and next slide please

2018
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:05,639
so um this is the

2019
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:08,520
the background uh unless you know this

2020
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,760
is the picture shows that uh hard

2021
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,560
standby mode uh uh we have

2022
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,800
two uh redundant sources connected to

2023
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,719
to V Taps there

2024
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:25,219
um let me look at this

2025
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,639
yeah it's a

2026
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:36,780
so um basically in the mpos case we have

2027
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:42,900
the ECI labels advertised in the uh

2028
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:47,280
spz route to to indicate the SPG route

2029
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,620
has served two purposes one to announce

2030
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,719
that certain flows are redundant floats

2031
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:55,380
it also carry the ESI labels so that the

2032
01:39:55,380 --> 01:40:02,340
egress P can use to tell which uh that

2033
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:05,120
which flow is for from which

2034
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:08,639
Ingress PE so in that case the egress

2035
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,760
speeds can can decide which flow to

2036
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,820
accept and which flow to discard but in

2037
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:19,500
the IP based data plane and

2038
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:23,159
where the ESI labels are not used so in

2039
01:40:23,159 --> 01:40:27,300
that case we would just use the IP Edge

2040
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,280
Source address of the outer

2041
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,880
encapsulation to tell which flow is from

2042
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,940
which Ingress PE and so that we know

2043
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,679
which flow to accept

2044
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,400
in the I actually to to clarify in the

2045
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,440
IP based tunnel there are two situations

2046
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:48,120
one is the vxline and and then the other

2047
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:51,239
one and is the genev

2048
01:40:51,239 --> 01:40:53,820
and I forgot which the other one where

2049
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:56,480
it does also have the

2050
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,520
equivalence of the ESI label so in that

2051
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,760
case we can still use the ESI and label

2052
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,340
a based approach for that purpose

2053
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:08,239
next slide please

2054
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:14,880
so

2055
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,100
um in the DSi case

2056
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,199
um

2057
01:41:18,199 --> 01:41:22,739
we have a pair of gateways between the

2058
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:26,100
two between the data center and data

2059
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:27,960
center interconnects

2060
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,780
so the the gateways

2061
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:34,619
will uh receive the both flows from the

2062
01:41:34,619 --> 01:41:37,560
Redundant sources and they will use the

2063
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:40,619
existing procedures to to decide which

2064
01:41:40,619 --> 01:41:42,000
flow

2065
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,600
like the Gateway should accept and after

2066
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,679
that the normal procedure is that only

2067
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,480
the

2068
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,900
the destiny folder

2069
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:56,940
of those two of those gateways will

2070
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:58,920
forward the traffic into the next data

2071
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,199
center or data center interconnect in

2072
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,820
this case

2073
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:03,659
um

2074
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,860
we could follow the same method that

2075
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:10,739
only the uh the Gateway will forward but

2076
01:42:10,739 --> 01:42:13,199
then we will lose the protection and

2077
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:17,100
once we pass the Gateway and so now the

2078
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,920
new procedure here in the data uh sender

2079
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:23,340
interconnect case is the gateways

2080
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:25,679
regardless of the

2081
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:26,940
uh

2082
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,460
testing the forward or not or for the

2083
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:30,300
traffic

2084
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:35,480
so now again egress piece will receive

2085
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,699
duplicate floats and now they need to

2086
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:42,060
decide whether to accept traffic or not

2087
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:45,619
and to do that the gateways will

2088
01:42:45,619 --> 01:42:50,239
re-originate the SPG route

2089
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:54,659
based on the received SPG route to

2090
01:42:54,659 --> 01:42:58,320
announce the redundancy case and

2091
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,580
in case of mqos data plan internet uh in

2092
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:06,360
the downstream we can use the again use

2093
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,960
these ESI label

2094
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,619
that is associated with that

2095
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:16,320
interconnects a virtual segment but here

2096
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,739
the one difference is that

2097
01:43:18,739 --> 01:43:21,300
those gateways they should have

2098
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,699
different ESL labels for the same

2099
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:29,760
virtual need in a segment so that's uh

2100
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,260
the downstream piece or gateways can

2101
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:38,699
use to determine which flows are from

2102
01:43:38,699 --> 01:43:41,400
which Gateway and then decide which

2103
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,040
flows to accept

2104
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,820
again

2105
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:47,460
and that's the assuming when the

2106
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:50,420
downstream segment a downstream is the

2107
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:54,420
mpos data playing or genev or srb6 data

2108
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:55,560
plane

2109
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:59,580
um but for other scenarios like vxlan we

2110
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,260
were used

2111
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,780
Source address of the gateways in the

2112
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:06,600
outer encapsulation to determine the

2113
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,760
flow and to determine the whether we

2114
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:11,420
accept or not

2115
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,639
there is also a

2116
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,400
another situation where

2117
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,639
even when you don't have the

2118
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:24,719
true Source redundancy then

2119
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:27,420
the fact that the post gateways are

2120
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:30,960
received as the single flow they can

2121
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,560
still decide to based on the operator's

2122
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,260
choice they can all send traffic to the

2123
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:40,199
to the downstream whether it's a text

2124
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:43,440
entry forward or not that's what we call

2125
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,800
Gateway introduced flow redundancy and

2126
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,760
similarly the um as long as the all the

2127
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:54,719
gateways and all the peas in the domain

2128
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:57,179
um act the same follow the same

2129
01:44:57,179 --> 01:44:59,639
procedure the downstream peas or

2130
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:03,500
gateways they can know that some

2131
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:06,719
there is this redundancy flow from the

2132
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:09,659
Gateway so that they can pick which flow

2133
01:45:09,659 --> 01:45:13,080
to accept and which flow to drop

2134
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,920
next slide please

2135
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,060
um so we have described the procedures

2136
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:25,739
in the uh in the draft but we need to

2137
01:45:25,739 --> 01:45:29,100
add more details on the normative part

2138
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:33,360
of the the draft we we will add more

2139
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:34,800
details

2140
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,040
to the draft in the meantime we says

2141
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,560
request feedbacks and comments from the

2142
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,100
working group

2143
01:45:44,219 --> 01:45:46,800
any comments

2144
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,380
do not see anyone in the queue

2145
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:50,580
thank you

2146
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:52,080
so say if you if you're still there

2147
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,000
we'll go back to you now I think I think

2148
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,100
it should be working again now okay

2149
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:16,020
okay let's start

2150
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:19,139
hi everyone I'm Steve from Hawaii and

2151
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:22,800
Funko is my co-author and I'm glad to

2152
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,100
present my new version draft about the

2153
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,500
mvpn Upstream designated for the

2154
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,900
selection so previously we have

2155
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:35,340
presented a draft in the ITF 113 and 114

2156
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:39,020
so next slide please

2157
01:46:40,139 --> 01:46:42,840
so when there are multiple PES in

2158
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,420
English sites we need to designate one

2159
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,540
as primary forward the traffic to the

2160
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:51,480
leaf PE another PE is chosen as a

2161
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:54,119
standby designated folder as a backup

2162
01:46:54,119 --> 01:46:57,480
but primary and standby receive traffic

2163
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,260
from both primary and standard ape

2164
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,000
receives the traffic from multicast

2165
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,060
source in warm route standby scenario

2166
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:08,940
only primary PE will fraud traffic to

2167
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:11,960
live PE in IFC

2168
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:15,540
1926 livpi needs to select primary and

2169
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:18,480
standby PE however problems such as

2170
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,940
inconsistency between the root and leaf

2171
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,940
P will result in slow fare over time

2172
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:26,699
therefore we propose the idea that the

2173
01:47:26,699 --> 01:47:29,880
Ingress PE should designate folders

2174
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,719
themselves to avoid the inconsistency

2175
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,540
Leaf PE will also accept all traffic

2176
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,940
from root PES

2177
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:41,699
so this time instead of the vrrp method

2178
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:44,600
in previous version We propose our new

2179
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,820
systematic and endogenous procedures for

2180
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:51,000
Ingress DF election and phosphere over

2181
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,760
we also introduced relevant attribute

2182
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:58,340
and Community next slide please

2183
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:03,000
so since the E Ingress PE will negotiate

2184
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,639
about the IDF role we propose two

2185
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:08,460
negotiation modes here the passive and

2186
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:11,639
the active one in passive mode c will

2187
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:13,739
decide which routes will forward traffic

2188
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:16,800
to leave PE the interfaces that are

2189
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:20,880
multi-home CE to PE are combined in each

2190
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,219
trunk interface

2191
01:48:23,219 --> 01:48:25,860
the root PES will be bundled together

2192
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:29,340
using the multi-chases protocol while in

2193
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,860
active mode the routers inside the c

2194
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,920
network and PE inside the Ingress site

2195
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:37,340
will be connected using layer 3

2196
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:40,739
interfaces the Ingress PE this time of

2197
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:43,080
independent routers traffic from

2198
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,540
multicast Source will be folded to all

2199
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:48,239
Ingress PES therefore the IDF election

2200
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:51,480
and negotiation need to be done actively

2201
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:54,420
inside the Ingress site next slide

2202
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,719
please

2203
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:02,639
so we Define a new community called IDF

2204
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:05,340
negotiation Community it is carried in

2205
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:08,460
the Upstream multicast help routes and

2206
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,860
its value will be allocated from the bgp

2207
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:13,560
well-known communities registry for each

2208
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,320
negotiation mode the um Edge routes will

2209
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,600
be delivered to the root PES and leave

2210
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:22,320
PE for root PE it is used to notify each

2211
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,260
other peas that this PE will participate

2212
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:28,560
the IDF election and leaf P will regard

2213
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,020
the community as a symbol to install the

2214
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:33,480
corresponding p-tunnel routed from the

2215
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:37,380
root PE into the leaf p is any cost RPF

2216
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:39,360
checklist

2217
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,119
The BFG discriminator attribute is

2218
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:46,619
firstly defining IFC 9026 and we reduces

2219
01:49:46,619 --> 01:49:49,440
the format and we add a new BFD mode

2220
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,500
type called unicast BFD session type the

2221
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:55,619
value is suggested to be two the BFD

2222
01:49:55,619 --> 01:49:58,139
discriminator attribute needs to carry a

2223
01:49:58,139 --> 01:50:01,739
mandatory Source IP tlv this time the IP

2224
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:04,739
address of this iptlv will be used to

2225
01:50:04,739 --> 01:50:07,199
establish the BFD session for failure

2226
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:10,580
detection next slide please

2227
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:14,280
foreign so let me introduce the election

2228
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,219
procedure in detail route B is firstly

2229
01:50:17,219 --> 01:50:20,040
originates the umh roots and the

2230
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,440
negotiation community and the BFD

2231
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,600
discriminator attribute are carried

2232
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:28,080
inside the IP addresses the source IPTV

2233
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,719
in vfd discriminator attribute is the

2234
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,020
RPF interface of the root PE as shown in

2235
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:36,300
the figure

2236
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:38,699
according to the negotiation Community

2237
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:42,060
leave PE will send distinct C multicast

2238
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:45,840
rules to HP root PE and pitano are

2239
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,580
installed and traffic from those

2240
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:50,460
installed pitanos will be valid and not

2241
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:51,719
be dropped

2242
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:55,159
next slide please

2243
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:00,719
so uh the root distinguishers of HP root

2244
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:02,699
p e for the same and Libyan are

2245
01:51:02,699 --> 01:51:05,460
suggested to be distinct when um

2246
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:08,699
attribute to client multicast Source are

2247
01:51:08,699 --> 01:51:11,520
advertised to each root PE they will

2248
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,679
know each other's originator IP

2249
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:16,560
addresses the key procedure here is to

2250
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,440
generate an ordered list of these IP

2251
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,440
addresses in ascending order just as

2252
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:24,000
shown in the table

2253
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,199
firstly if for different scenarios two

2254
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:31,080
methods are defined here firstly if all

2255
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,080
c groups uses the same primary and the

2256
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:37,199
standby IDF the election occurs upon

2257
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:39,840
receiving all the UN attributes of other

2258
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,719
pe's according to each pe's position

2259
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,940
within the list they will be given

2260
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:48,480
different indexes PE have index 0 will

2261
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:51,600
be the primary IDF and with index 1 will

2262
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,840
be the standby PE

2263
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:57,540
so next slide please

2264
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:00,600
the second method is for the load

2265
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,820
balancing scenario this time different

2266
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:06,780
groups can use different PES or IDF and

2267
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,300
the one C group will have different p as

2268
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,719
primary and standby PE the order list is

2269
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:15,000
used here also but with different

2270
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,119
algorithms the election occurs upon

2271
01:52:18,119 --> 01:52:20,340
receiving C multicast drawing of the

2272
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:23,580
corresponding group from Leaf PE p with

2273
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:26,760
index I will be the IDF if I equals to

2274
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:30,780
group mode n after the IDF is selected

2275
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:33,679
is elected a new ordered list without

2276
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:36,420
idfpe will be used to calculate the

2277
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:39,659
standby p e and the equation becomes J

2278
01:52:39,659 --> 01:52:42,960
equals to group mode n minus 1 and p e

2279
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,320
with index J would be the standby IDF

2280
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,460
next slide please

2281
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:53,520
so we have elected our primary and

2282
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,520
standby IDF with above procedures

2283
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:59,219
another very important function of warm

2284
01:52:59,219 --> 01:53:01,920
route standby scenario is to detect the

2285
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,260
failure of the primary IDF and perform

2286
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:07,080
faster over this time we mainly

2287
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,119
introduce our endogenous method for

2288
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:10,380
active mode

2289
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:12,540
in order to detect the failure of the

2290
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:15,360
primary IDF the standby IDF need to

2291
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,119
initialize a BFD session the destination

2292
01:53:18,119 --> 01:53:20,760
IP address of the session is the ipf

2293
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,699
interface of the primary IDF therefore

2294
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:27,360
when the IDF device or its client facing

2295
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,000
link is done the standby P will

2296
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,159
immediately notice that and take over

2297
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:34,560
the primary IDF role to forward the

2298
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,580
traffic

2299
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:38,340
when the traffic arrives at Leaf PE it

2300
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:40,800
will not be dropped because the p tunnel

2301
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,440
has already been installed into its any

2302
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:46,519
cost RPF list

2303
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,960
next slide please

2304
01:53:52,219 --> 01:53:55,560
so finally the data forwarding behavior

2305
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,560
of the route and leave PES are discussed

2306
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,260
in active mode if there are local

2307
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:04,199
receivers at the Ingress site they can

2308
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:06,060
receive traffic directly from the

2309
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:08,760
corresponding root PES because all root

2310
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:11,580
peas can receive traffic while in a

2311
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:14,219
passive mode only one of the root PE can

2312
01:54:14,219 --> 01:54:16,739
receive traffic therefore the p with

2313
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:19,260
local receivers will install pitano

2314
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:22,320
towards the IDF the traffic will be

2315
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,540
forwarded through the P tunnel and it

2316
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,760
will only be forwarded towards the local

2317
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:29,040
receivers to avoid the track traffic

2318
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:32,699
Loop as for the leaf PES they accept the

2319
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:36,659
traffic from hpe but at a time there

2320
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:39,600
will be only one traffic that folded

2321
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:42,480
from the source therefore they can

2322
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,119
accept the traffic from the standby IDF

2323
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:47,340
without latency

2324
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:50,840
so next slide please

2325
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:53,880
so that's all for my presentation so we

2326
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,239
are welcome any comments and discussion

2327
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:59,280
and thank you so if you have any

2328
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,119
question you can ask

2329
01:55:02,699 --> 01:55:04,860
okay thanks very much I don't see I

2330
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:06,239
think we should move ahead

2331
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,159
um with the final final presentation

2332
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:11,420
which is uh when then

2333
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:17,299
are you there

2334
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,440
you can try okay

2335
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,280
let me just uh

2336
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:36,900
um

2337
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:40,560
so this is a proposal for a newly

2338
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,080
extended Community to advertise

2339
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:47,100
uh group-based policy ID

2340
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:50,119
next slide please

2341
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,360
so for EVP and vxlan there is this

2342
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:57,780
concept of group based policy

2343
01:55:57,780 --> 01:56:00,719
um so that's uh

2344
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:03,659
the Ingress p is

2345
01:56:03,659 --> 01:56:05,219
can

2346
01:56:05,219 --> 01:56:09,960
can signal to the egress PE in the data

2347
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:13,020
package on what group policy to be

2348
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:14,940
applied at the egress when the traffic

2349
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:17,100
arrives there

2350
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:21,600
um by the it could be that the Ingress

2351
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,780
send the traffic to the egress and after

2352
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:28,020
the egress applies the policy that's

2353
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:30,739
steady signaled in the packet itself

2354
01:56:30,739 --> 01:56:33,719
then the decision is to drop the package

2355
01:56:33,719 --> 01:56:35,400
after we have got the packets of the

2356
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:38,300
egress we want to avoid the situation

2357
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:41,719
Next Step please

2358
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:44,040
so we

2359
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:48,060
want to apply the policy on the Ingress

2360
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:50,280
instead of getting the traffic to the

2361
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:52,560
egress and then dropped

2362
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,580
next slide please

2363
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:59,159
so this is the proposed extended

2364
01:56:59,159 --> 01:57:00,840
Community

2365
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:04,860
um that encodes the group policy ID

2366
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:07,560
um it's a non-trans transitive OPEC

2367
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:11,820
extended Community we encode the policy

2368
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:16,320
ID which is a 16-bit value there

2369
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:16,980
um

2370
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:20,400
I think we already got a type and

2371
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:23,599
subtype allocated from Diana

2372
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:28,920
this can be carried by the VPN type 2

2373
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:31,380
type 5 and type 3 routes in control

2374
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:35,099
plane so that the Ingress nodes knows

2375
01:57:35,099 --> 01:57:39,800
that uh for which traffic will apply the

2376
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:42,360
policy on the Ingress side

2377
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:45,199
next slide please

2378
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:51,060
so um the DCI procedures uh will need to

2379
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:54,719
be added we also request feedbacks from

2380
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,560
the working group

2381
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,599
okay

2382
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:02,639
Nokia

2383
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,580
yeah the the giraffe is is pretty clear

2384
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:07,619
and straightforward my question is is

2385
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:09,780
more about the group policy draft which

2386
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:13,500
is a long time expired so uh is the

2387
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:16,619
intend to resurrect it

2388
01:58:16,619 --> 01:58:17,699
um

2389
01:58:17,699 --> 01:58:20,760
I don't know the prank about that drafts

2390
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,420
but apparently uh we have some uh

2391
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:28,080
customer use cases that they wanted to

2392
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:28,880
do

2393
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:32,280
uh this kind of things

2394
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:34,619
um I I think

2395
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:37,739
uh need to ask wing and Zhang to talk

2396
01:58:37,739 --> 01:58:41,159
about the plan for that draft okay yeah

2397
01:58:41,159 --> 01:58:44,639
I think I I agree with you if this is

2398
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,380
the first point there is no real point

2399
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:49,500
to create something at the control plane

2400
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,960
and try to standardize it if the data

2401
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:55,139
plane is not standardized

2402
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:58,940
so we may have to move forward

2403
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:02,639
the the other comment and and probably

2404
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:03,980
Matthews

2405
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:06,900
can clarify but my understanding was

2406
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:10,020
that the um yeah consensus was not to

2407
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:13,440
extend a vxlan right but to if there is

2408
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,840
an extension to do do it probably in

2409
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,020
geneve or vxlan gpe right

2410
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:21,599
but not vxlan per se

2411
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:25,320
yeah we we didn't

2412
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:28,500
so the VX Lan RFC anyway is was went

2413
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,739
through on the individual track

2414
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:33,840
um certainly from an nv03 perspective

2415
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,020
the preference would definitely be to to

2416
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:40,080
go for and use Junaid that's that's the

2417
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:42,119
kind of ITF Direction

2418
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:43,440
okay

2419
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,300
um I actually I just realized that this

2420
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:47,580
draft is

2421
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:51,960
about using uh Ingress uh

2422
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:55,699
uh policy enforcement to replace

2423
01:59:55,699 --> 01:59:59,520
the egress policy replacement so it does

2424
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,980
it does not need a mean that we are

2425
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:04,739
Reviving that uh group based policy

2426
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:08,880
draft that's actually put into the uh uh

2427
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,280
the policy ID into the vxn package

2428
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,920
itself we are we're proposing a

2429
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,900
different solution

2430
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:18,300
okay so when you signal from the egress

2431
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:20,820
PE to the Ingress is not used in the

2432
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:22,800
data path right right this is an

2433
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,480
alternative solution to that it's better

2434
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,840
better option yeah okay I totally missed

2435
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,119
it right thank you

2436
02:00:30,119 --> 02:00:32,219
I think uh one last comment from wendlin

2437
02:00:32,219 --> 02:00:34,679
is in the queue

2438
02:00:34,679 --> 02:00:37,460
disappeared

2439
02:00:37,739 --> 02:00:40,080
okay all right thanks so much everyone

2440
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:44,179
and uh I think that's that's it

2441
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:06,199
foreign

2442
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:38,179
strange

2443
02:01:38,179 --> 02:01:41,460
sometimes technology

2444
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:45,260
actually generally it was super well

2445
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,560
um

2446
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:16,820
foreign
