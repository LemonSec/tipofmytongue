1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,980
behind my left and I was surprised that

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,179
the non-comm is still there

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,660
oh yeah

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,619
oh yeah the question where maybe that

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,740
pointed or anything

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,260
so that would be General in some areas

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,180
like we don't have any and some are like

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,079
we have this and so but no it was it was

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,600
nothing I don't know

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,059
playing in the Army and handle

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,899
so the questions generally was

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,699
managing sometimes

13
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,219
pretty challenging and there is no one

14
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,320
single answer

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,780
I think

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,459
I'm mostly just hoping people don't go I

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,220
just ignore

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,400
[Laughter]

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,960
you know people know that it might be

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,260
part should we um yeah

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,959
linked off the data tracker where you

75
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,180
can find how you can participate fully

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,319
in today's session

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,060
so welcome again to agendaspatch this

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,739
hybrid meeting

79
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,480
um it's great to be here we're excited

80
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,400
and for the agenda today we just have

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,400
one item the relationship between the

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,159
ietf and its trust so we have some time

83
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,080
to bash this agenda if anyone has

84
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,420
objections or issues to it but we've

85
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,360
allocated 25 times at 25 minutes to as

86
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040
time for the relationship between the

87
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,959
iitf and its trust and then hopefully

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,060
we'll get closer to a dispatching

89
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,620
outcome as to how the worker should

90
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,659
advance and proceed and then we have

91
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,340
some Flex time for anyone who wants to

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,620
bring issues

93
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,319
or pause so that we can thoroughly bash

94
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,579
the agenda if we want to

95
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,080
and as a final reminder please do head

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,879
over to the note-taking page and help us

97
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,280
record the excellent discussion that is

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,700
about to follow

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,319
okay so hearing No Agenda bashes we'll

100
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,360
just go straight to the item so we have

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,560

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,020
of the clause in the uh

104
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,000

actively speaking uh first of all so

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,919
what I'm going to talk about here on is

109
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,660
is without any Dotson as an individual

110
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,460
participant but but while I still sort

111
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,740
of have a ad hat thank you Mata for

112
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,419

113
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,680
Pete Resnick

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,919
whose new role in the uh what did you

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,500
take on first it wasn't rswg it was it

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,440
was I said oh yeah we just had it

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,759
um but yeah

118
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,720
thank you for not knowing is uh yes the

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,580
right answer so thanks for stopping I

120
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,380
had a really good pool of volunteers to

121
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,720
select from I uh noted everybody's name

122
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,639
that I didn't pick for for Gen dispatch

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,680
so you might expect me to hit you up if

124
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
I have future roles to fill and I will

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,060
pass your name along to other 80s so so

126
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,100
just so that you're warned but as I said

127
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,340
this this document uh sort of it's a

128
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,900
zero zero it's a short one came actually

129
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,000
out of sort of me doing a bit of

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,139
research

131
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,460
um that was sort of motivated by the

132
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,139
trust restructuring proposal that that

133
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,639
was announced a while ago and the

134
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
consultation that they had

135
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,320
um and also um I while I send it to the

136
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,780
Gen dispatch list to get a discussion

137
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,180
started I didn't actually request time

138
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,080
here

139
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,820
um so the only the only reason I

140
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,680
realized that I was on the agenda was

141
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,539
that I looked at the agenda to see if

142
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,120
there was one and I realized oh

143
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
um and but that by then it was too late

144
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,320
for us to do anything about it and I

145
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,580
just decided I'm gonna make some slides

146
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,500
I'm going to present anyway but I

147
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,120
thought it was a bit premature to even

148
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,860
talk about this without having a bit

149
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,539
more email discussion first but but here

150
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,940
we are so that's the caveat uh can you

151
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,580
do next slide

152
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,580
um so so as I said right um as part of

153
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,919
this sort of me trying to understand the

154
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,440
trust restructuring proposal

155
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,660
um like many ITF participants right I

156
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,220
never really paid attention to the trust

157
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,259
otherly I knew it helps the assets on a

158
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,539
copyright but I didn't really ever need

159
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,340
to like bother myself with how it does

160
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,800
that or or so on but I figured

161
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,020
I might take this you know due diligence

162
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,100
thing

163
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,620
um having a black dot to to sort of read

164
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,139
up a little bit and so I looked at you

165
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,819
know sort of my feelings and and

166
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,620
thoughts and what I thought the trust

167
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,300
did based on you being around for a

168
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,380
while

169
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,960
um looking at the Trust website which

170
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,280
has the founding documents and a whole

171
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,020
bunch of other material about the trust

172
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,060
that describes what they're doing right

173
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,160
and then I sort of my impression of what

174
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,080
I saw the trust doing as an observer

175
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,699
outside

176
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,680
um and I sort of tried to reconcile this

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,720
and I find sort of a whole lot of

178
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,639
overlap right which is the expected

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,900
outcome if you're doing this sort of

180
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,819
thing but I also found some sort of gaps

181
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,020
and I want to sort of stress right

182
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,060
there's nothing critical here but

183
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,539
nothing's on fire right but um because

184
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,780
of these sort of misalignments the minor

185
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,819
ones that I found I was sort of

186
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,860
wondering why isn't there a document

187
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,139
like I think it was Joel who wrote I

188
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,599
want to say 87 29

189
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,300
so 8729 is a document written from the

190
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,699
perspective of the ITF as an

191
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,160
informational document describing the

192
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,620
expectations that the ITF has for the

193
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,660
trust in terms of the licensing under

194
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,759
which it makes the assets available and

195
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,199
when I first saw the title I was like

196
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,880
this is exactly the document I thought

197
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,259
we had somewhere and great I'm going to

198
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,599
read it but it really limits itself to

199
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,780
giving guidance or suggestions on the

200
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,940
licensing alone and I figured this

201
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,800
some other expectations that at least

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
sort of I had

203
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,340
um about the trust that I didn't see

204
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,340
sort of reflected on the iitf side but I

205
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,020
also didn't really see it over on the

206
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,880
Trust website and I started to write

207
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,440
some of those things down as I did this

208
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,580
research and that's sort of where this

209
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,979
document came from and I sent this to a

210
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,080
bunch of people so I've sent it to a few

211
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,199
um previous aeds uh previous IDF chairs

212
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,419
and a bunch of people on the trust and

213
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,819
um sort of gathered some input and I

214
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,740
reflected some of that before I posted

215
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,360
it and then I decided to post it to have

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,819
a discussion on the Gen dispatch mailing

217
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,599
list

218
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,400
um and that's where Russ for example as

219
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,840
the co-author came from because he was

220
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,360
one of the persons that I that I emailed

221
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,020
um

222
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,299
and and I want to point out that sort of

223
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,458
there's a reason why I picked for

224
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,919
example Russ and Yari right because

225
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,599
um iasa 2 changed uh quite a bit about

226
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,980
the trust because previous two isr2 the

227
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,440
ioc and the trust were the same people

228
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,260
and they had the ITF chair and the

229
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,880
executive director

230
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,800
as part of the ioc and as part of the

231
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,420
truster it was basically a one-to-one

232
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,000
Personnel overlap between the trust and

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,980
what would now be considered the iitf

234
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,180
LLC

235
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,180
and ayasa 2 basically completely changed

236
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,220
this model where all trustees are now

237
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,160
independently appointed by the isg isoc

238
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,140
and mostly the nomcom right but there's

239
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,779
no overlap anymore and there weren't

240
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,640
even any formal Liaisons or something

241
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,959
like that therefore and I think this is

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,120
an oversight uh but nobody really paid

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,160
attention to this uh during ayasa too

244
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,240
because there were other things that

245
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
were more important but I think it's

246
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,660
sort of something that we might want to

247
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,459
revisit sort of probably informally

248
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,220
between the trust and the LLC to see if

249
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,720
we can inform ourselves better anyway so

250
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,160
that's a lot about where this comes from

251
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,800
right the high level point is nothing's

252
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,779
on fire uh next slide please

253
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,420
um sort of sort of this is my impression

254
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,459
of what I believe the relationship is

255
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,800
I've the document is written as if this

256
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,200
was ITF consensus it's not right this is

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,300
an individual zero zero and the

258
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,940
questions are you know is my uh

259
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,740
understanding or my belief here like in

260
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,080
the rough or is it shared and and

261
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,700
independently of that it's like is it

262
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,380
even useful to write this down in some

263
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,100
form

264
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,839
but you know this is what we're here for

265
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,260
so the trust in my view is a core part

266
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,380
of the iitf The Wider iitf because it

267
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,720
holds the assets that we generate and

268
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,820
then we need to work right

269
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,959
but it's not part of the ITF LLC or in a

270
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,480
legal sense and it was specifically set

271
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,260
up to be isolated right so the the iitf

272
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,779
community and the ITF LLC as the

273
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,800
representative

274
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,279
can't give directions to the trust by

275
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,560
Design right

276
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,940
um but I would say operationally right

277
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,040
their part because they hold the assets

278
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
that we require on and also like I don't

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,820
know if morally is the right word here

280
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,339
as a non-native speaker but you know the

281
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,560
trustees come from the IDF community

282
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,779
pretty much all of them do I stock

283
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,820
appointees I would count as ITF

284
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,260
community in a wider sense as well right

285
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,980
so they're they are appointed by us they

286
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,380
come from us and therefore in my view

287
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,540
they should sort of morally want to

288
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,820
reflect the expectations that the ITF

289
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,100
Community has on how the trust operates

290
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,220
unless it sort of goes against the

291
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,800
purpose of the trust right so that comes

292
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,940
first

293
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,459
and so that means to me at least that

294
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,660
the itaf community should have an

295
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,940
ability to express the desires we have

296
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,579
about the trust and I would expect sort

297
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,860
of an openness on the trust side to sort

298
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,519
of

299
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,420
be open to those expectations right

300
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,339
um

301
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,839
and and sort of the community should

302
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,300
have sort of some measures to secure

303
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,100
this relationship going forward this is

304
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,320
where the restructuring might come in

305
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
but it also the flip side of this is

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,100
right this is our trust it holds our

307
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,140
assets and for example that means we

308
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,060
need a fund it adequately so we can do

309
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,339
the job well right and and the people

310
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,560
you know have adequate indemnification

311
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,540
in terms of insurance and other means

312
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,339
right this is sort of a flip side of

313
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,180
this thing

314
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,199
next slide

315
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,440
so there's there's a little there's some

316
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,120
misalignments that I that I found that

317
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm not really going to talk about even

318
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,720
here I think the biggest one

319
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,459
um that that surprised me the most I

320
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,899
must say is that the foundational

321
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,480
documents say that the trust should

322
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,339
publish or must publish I forget what

323
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,720
the word says

324
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,279
um and this is a quote right procedures

325
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,220
for the management of the assets

326
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,860
and because you know the purpose of the

327
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,720
trust is to hold the assets and to

328
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,160
manage them and to license them out

329
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,500
freely right and so to me this is sort

330
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,800
of this having these procedures publicly

331
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,260
documented and we can argue about the

332
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,880
level of detail that's required I think

333
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,380
it's sort of a key requirement for

334
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,660
having some operational transparency and

335
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,060
and I don't want to we don't have that

336
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,380
at the moment at least we don't have it

337
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,500
in a way that I would call this right

338
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,720
there's a lengthy FAQ there's a lot of

339
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,880
other material in the Trust website but

340
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,279
but nothing that I would you know could

341
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,980
see having that headline and this is not

342
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,600
the fault of the current trust right the

343
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,860
trust has been around for a long time

344
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,899
this should have actually been published

345
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,600
with the creation of the trust it's part

346
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,800
of the founding agreement it's just

347
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,019
never been done and I think that sort of

348
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,700
makes it a little bit difficult because

349
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,620
if we had that right that would have

350
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,760
probably been the document that I had

351
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,399
read and I said an understanding of what

352
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,959
the expectations should have been on my

353
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,279
side next slide

354
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,860
right the the other thing maybe is that

355
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,639
um

356
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
I think the trust

357
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,320
is sort of maybe lagging a little bit

358
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,360
behind other parts of the iitf in terms

359
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,820
of transparency but most other groups

360
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,440
have open meetings

361
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,600
I don't think that the trust does I

362
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,680
don't think they would say no somebody

363
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,720
says can I like listen in but like

364
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,940
formally they're closed

365
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,519
um there's there's these these

366
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,079
opportunities operational guidelines I

367
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,120
think are missing and

368
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,860
um I think it would just be helpful if

369
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,139
the trust would follow other parts of

370
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,399
the community instead of being open

371
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,680
maybe having office hours

372
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,500
um maybe you know presenting or emailing

373
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,839
our information a bit more freely

374
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,139
um and and that email is cheap right and

375
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,480
um I think you know I've discussed this

376
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,940
a bit with parts of the trust and often

377
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,639
there's nothing to report right and we

378
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,899
can have an argument about whether

379
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,700
sending an email that says nothing new

380
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,160
over here is really all that useful

381
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,139
um maybe of the French opinion that

382
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,880
that's still useful so I know nothing is

383
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,200
going on

384
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,880
um and likewise right the LLC office

385
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,680
hours that I go to

386
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,680
um as a as a board member rarely people

387
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,660
show up so it often feels like you know

388
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,820
why do we have them I still think it's

389
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,980
important to schedule them just in case

390
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,019
right and I think that I want to suggest

391
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,300
that the Trust might do the same thing

392
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
um next slide

393
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,279
I think it's the last one already

394
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,079
it is so that's sort of where this

395
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,399
document comes from and that's sort of

396
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,139
what it tries to do so it tries to write

397
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,519
down

398
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,740
um what a what a hopefully Community

399
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,800
expectations on on what the trust should

400
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,180
do

401
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,920
um it's currently an individual document

402
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,199
from from me and Russ right and and

403
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,240
but the questions are this is even

404
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,880
useful document to try to produce

405
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
um you know is is the in and if it is

406
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,779
right it's a current document the

407
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,220
current content even a good starting

408
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,079
point or

409
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,639
um if you know we want to have a

410
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,899
document like this should it start from

411
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,519
somewhere else and the thing I didn't

412
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,680
put on there is right you know I can say

413
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,360
how many times I want that I'm you know

414
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,800
doing this as an individual I still

415
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,839
happen to be IHF chair so if somebody

416
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,339
else wants to hold the pen on this with

417
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,220
Russ I'm very happy to not hold a pen uh

418
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,839
as I said it started out as my personal

419
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,339
notes and that's why it's my draft now

420
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,360
thank you

421
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
great thank you so we've got a few

422
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,540
people who've joined the queue um first

423
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,620
up is Barry Leiber

424
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,380
hi this is Barry Lieber um I think other

425
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,440
than tweaking the tone a bit to make it

426
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,060
clearer in the document that it's not

427
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,279
adversarial it's it's basically a good

428
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,920
starting point and uh for the dispatch

429
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,860
question I think uh it's probably simple

430
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,300
enough that it doesn't need a working

431
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,519
group and it could just be ad sponsored

432
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,740
if it's going to be ad sponsored

433
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,779
probably better to have another

434
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,620
Community member other than an ad being

435
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,180
co-author and I had a quick question

436
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,899
what's the status of reincorporating the

437
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,600
trust in Delaware or wherever that is

438
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,459
and John can answer there's a question

439
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,239
for the trust right

440
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,279
keeping in mind that I am no longer a

441
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,779
trustee

442
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,459
um it's about halfway through the

443
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,320
process they have filed the

444
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,120
incorporation papers with the state of

445
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,339
Delaware there is some minor glitch

446
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:39,720
where the state of Delaware says no

447
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,220
trust is a magic word so you have to

448
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,320
call yourself the ietf intellectual

449
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,880
property Corporation or something like

450
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,300
that and so the next step is to go to

451
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,620
the IRS and re and reconstitute the

452
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,920
um tax exemption which is which is

453
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,699
administratively straightforward but

454
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,259
they're totally backed up and then once

455
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,220
they do that then there's more

456
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,199
mechanical stuff of moving stuff from

457
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,480
one place to the other and they just got

458
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,059
their liability tax bill which reminds

459
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,559
us of why it's important to do this

460
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,359
because the trust currently is basically

461
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,679
uninsurable

462
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,280
right

463
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,640
okay John did you want to take your turn

464
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,140
now and I'll wait for you since you were

465
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,240
just at Mike

466
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,140
um

467
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,540
uh Ted Hardy from the dispatch

468
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,440
perspective uh I actually disagree that

469
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,020
this could be 80 sponsored I think it

470
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,940
either needs to be managed by the trust

471
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,200
as a working group

472
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
slash mailing list under them uh or it

473
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,580
needs to be a full-fledged working group

474
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,200
that we invite the whole Community to

475
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,660
because as it stands right now in

476
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,679
addition to the assets uh that the ITF

477
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,660
has for their other Assets in the trust

478
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,720
now including the Ayana assets and so I

479
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,100
think it would need to have a level of

480
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,600
openness either at the level of the

481
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,120
trust itself or one where we could say

482
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,679
there's a full-fledged working group you

483
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,140
all come I think if we do ad sponsor

484
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,740
that's a little bit to

485
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,020
um two inside baseball for for some of

486
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,120
the other people who might be you can

487
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,539
ask your clarification followers so so

488
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,660
you saying that do you so this tries to

489
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,940
set the expectations from the ITF

490
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,280
Community perspective do you think this

491
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,539
should be broader and talk about

492
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,820
expectations of other stakeholders that

493
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,140
have their Assets in the trust because

494
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,580
that would be for example the Ayana

495
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,640
right so I think your document isn't as

496
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,860
clear about that scope as you may think

497
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,740
it is if and the first suggestion to

498
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,919
have it be the trust that runs this um

499
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,260
although it's bearing tying a burden to

500
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,179
their backs they may not want means that

501
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,220
they could open it up to the full set of

502
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,799
stakeholders if they wanted to if if you

503
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,660
want to limit it to the ihf's

504
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,580
expectations some of your document has

505
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,900
to go

506
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,840
um so for example you currently have in

507
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,640
your document that you think the ietf

508
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,780
ought to be the one uh that's the uh

509
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,419
in essence the primary funding Agency

510
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,720
for it there's a good bit of legal

511
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,980
um

512
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,260
hindrance to that in that in order to

513
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,380
meet the public support test 40501 C3

514
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,980
independent of the 501c3 that is the

515
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,620
isoc nitf LLC and it has to be

516
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,539
independent because of the way the

517
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,880
original settler documents are if it's

518
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
an independent 501c3 it has to meet the

519
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,860
the public support test independently

520
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,660
which means it can't get all of its

521
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,700
money from one place and it would be

522
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,120
better if it actually had the other

523
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,799
communities that are stakeholders

524
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,340
participating in the fundraising so I've

525
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,080
I think there are differences of opinion

526
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,580
about this

527
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,799
um but that might be going into too much

528
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,940
detail for this discussion this is

529
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,320
nothing but I wanna I wanna point out

530
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,600
that sort of I think because the the I

531
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,320
the trust is is mostly holding the iitf

532
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
uh IPR and it's it's calling itself the

533
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,760
iitf trust for probably for that reason

534
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,320
and in the Ayana assets were added sort

535
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,059
of as an afterthought in the wrinkle of

536
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,520
the you know this better than I do yeah

537
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,080
um but I think therefore right it's the

538
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,059
ITF community's sort of obligation to

539
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,480
fund it and and if the trust requires a

540
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,460
diversity of funding to land in their

541
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,340
accounts that is fully fine and

542
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,380
understood I believe it's then up to us

543
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,840
on the ITF side to generate that for

544
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,700
them

545
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,340
uh so let me let me go back to the very

546
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,780
beginning and say I'm not wearing any

547
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,660
hats uh because that lets me put on a

548
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,559
hat for a moment I have in previous uh

549
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,679
uh Jobs been one of the people who uh

550
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,960
went and got money from my company to

551
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,940
give to the trust

552
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,160
um and there I don't think there was any

553
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,440
confusion about which one was the trust

554
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,380
or which one was uh ietf the standards

555
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,480
development organization but partially

556
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,860
because there were somebody sitting

557
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,960
there uh to explain it to them so if

558
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,880
your argument is that members of the

559
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,500
ietf community

560
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,360
ought to do that I'm totally in

561
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,700
agreement with you that's not how I read

562
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,620
your document right now

563
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,480
um and I think the dispatch problem

564
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,120
we're trying to deal with is who has to

565
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,280
answer that question and I think the

566
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,380
community that has to answer that

567
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,200
question is big enough that I would not

568
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,820
argue for

569
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,559
ad sponsored I would say either the

570
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,360
trust needs to do it as across

571
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,700
stakeholders or if the ITF needs to do

572
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,760
it for itself what it can say is and we

573
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,559
encourage any member of the iitf

574
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,200
community who's got some Pocket Change

575
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,600
uh to uh to put that pocket change to a

576
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,760
good cause by helping out the trust and

577
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,260
contributing to their public support

578
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,500
that's a cool thing for us to do for a a

579
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,360
related organization but we have to do

580
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,880
it recognizing that it is an independent

581
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,220
organization and must remain so

582
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,440
correct and and I'm not disagreeing with

583
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,760
your recommendation for that for the

584
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,340
dispatch outcome right but I think for

585
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,080
um the money question right remember the

586
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,840
the ITF Community charged the iitf LLC

587
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,179
with fundraising and specifically hiring

588
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,039
a fundraiser they were sending out into

589
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,200
the immediate community of the iitf

590
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
right but also like far away

591
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,179
um to like get us money and

592
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,580
um I would not want to make her job more

593
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,039
difficult by having two entities that

594
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,840
have the same four letters in their

595
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,600
title asking around for money at the

596
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,299
moment within our small community like

597
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,100
with with you graciously funding both of

598
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,539
these things you understand the

599
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:28,440
difference

600
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,460
as we go further from the ietf I'm not

601
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,039
sure this is true and I also think that

602
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,720
the community expressed that they expect

603
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,659
the ITF LLC fundraiser to fundraise for

604
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,340
the broader ITF and we you know I mean

605
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,840
this is a discussion that we have

606
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,340
differences of opinion on and that's

607
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,400
reasonable but yes it's a it's a wrinkle

608
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,440
in this where it's my opinion and if

609
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,240
that's not carried by the community it

610
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,559
will need to change

611
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,480
um in the docus so I think you could

612
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,559
have a couple of different opinions

613
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,659
there but as long as what you are saying

614
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,620
is you think the IHF LLC got a charge to

615
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,860
raise money for a related institution

616
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,260
then we agree

617
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,179
um that doesn't mean

618
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,419
however that it's raising money that can

619
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,720
pass through the ietf to reach the IHF

620
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,880
trust correct because that's what causes

621
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,500
the public support yes well maybe my I

622
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,240
try to be subtle in my rewarding but so

623
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,260
I I believe it is on the IHF LLC or the

624
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,780
iitf community to orchestrate a stream

625
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,380
of funding that arrives at the trust in

626
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,140
a way that lets them pass the test and

627
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,220
if that means it needs to go there

628
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,260
directly that's what it means right but

629
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,120
it is still I think the obligation of

630
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,940
the iitf LLC to make that happen so it

631
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,320
doesn't interfere with the broader

632
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,700
fundraising that we do for the

633
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,340
organization and for the meetings Okay

634
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,900
um I I'm just going to go back to the

635
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,159
dispatch question because there's a long

636
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,799
line here I think this this level of uh

637
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,200
Rat holding right away indicates to me

638
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,980
you you need a a working group or an ITF

639
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,320
trust mailing list for those of us who

640
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,940
actually want to go play with the rats

641
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,220
to go talk in that doing it in any

642
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,080
existing list is probably not going to

643
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,640
work thank you I mean immediate

644
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,840
directions if it leads the working group

645
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,159
it's probably too difficult a

646
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,840
conversation to have

647
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,299
and maybe not doing anything is better

648
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,580
but anyway I might change my mind on

649
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,418
this but um

650
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,360
I am back yeah and again I'm not a

651
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,860
trustee but I was a trustee for six

652
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,100
years and when I look at this document I

653
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,380
see a lot of it is perfectly fine like

654
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,840
and it's just it's sort of minor

655
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,100
administrative oversights that are easy

656
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,320
to fix like the reason that there is no

657
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,360
expense reimbursement policy is that

658
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,280
they've never reimbursed in expense so

659
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,440
yeah but that's easy to fix some of it

660
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,700
is just weird like the thing about the

661
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,500
high security module is there is no high

662
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,240
security module it never wasn't there

663
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,799
never was a high security module and I'm

664
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,940
kind of surprised that Russ didn't know

665
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,500
that

666
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,179
um so AMS tells me okay but I am

667
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,700
concerned that there are particularly

668
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,860
with the issue of the licenses I mean

669
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,659
even though like there didn't used to be

670
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,100
an asset register another is an asset

671
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,179
register and even though the asset

672
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,580
register only has like 12 things on it

673
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,340
okay that actually is an accurate

674
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,980
description of the licenses we have and

675
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,419
the reason is

676
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,280
the reason the trust was was was

677
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,100
invented is that until until RFC 3978

678
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,020
every RFC is what's known in the

679
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,179
copyright world as an orphan work we

680
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,980
don't know who owns the rights we don't

681
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,720
know who might claim the rights and

682
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,520
there is no practical way short of

683
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,720
hiring a lawyer and paying them

684
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,980
thousands of dollars to determine the

685
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,100
right document by document right so the

686
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,960
point of 3978 and the point of the trust

687
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,580
is basically we have this foul swamp

688
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,799
here and then we built a dyke okay and

689
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,720
everything since we built the dike since

690
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,500
3978 everything since then we have the

691
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,059
rights and the rights are what the

692
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,919
rights are what the rfcs say you know an

693
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,140
hrfc you apply correct applies okay

694
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,380
members of stuff before that

695
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,080
um as Joel said we made some effort to

696
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,419
go back to Old authors and and have them

697
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,820
give his licenses and we have since

698
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,980
discovered that the that our executive

699
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,659
director was kind of sloppy about that

700
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,700
and it would make sense to go back to

701
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,140
the people we can still find and say

702
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,059
could you could you redo redo those

703
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,760
licenses but beyond that I mean like if

704
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,559
you want to list I mean truly a list of

705
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,880
what rights do we have it's like before

706
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,960
39 78 we don't know and since 39-78 it's

707
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,620
what the rfcs say so my advice

708
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,620
is perhaps more complicated than you

709
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,779
would like okay one is I think this

710
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,279
document can be fixed but I think you

711
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,159
need people with more trust and legal

712
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,480
experience and if you want me to do it

713
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,279
I'm happy to help and help you what

714
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,020
other people you can but I also think it

715
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,400
would be useful to have a companion

716
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,480
document that describes for engineers

717
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,980
how the trust which is essentially a

718
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,960
legal organization

719
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,000
um obtains and preserves

720
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,740
the rights to our documents in a way

721
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,539
that turns out to be totally unique we

722
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,700
were so lucky that George turns out to

723
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,260
be like the world's most skilled lawyer

724
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,960
okay

725
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
when you said it was totally unique that

726
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,840
really means you need to write it down

727
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,580
no we did write it down it's in the it's

728
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,860
in the rfcs okay but I think yeah a

729
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,480
non-normative descriptive document about

730
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,980
how this allowed I mean we're the only

731
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,360
sdo in the world where you can show up

732
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,860
and write and write text that ends up in

733
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,179
a standards document everywhere else you

734
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,320
need to sign contracts and have your

735
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,159
lawyers

736
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,440
lawyers approve it so I think you know

737
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,559
so my advice is this is fixable

738
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,380
with advice that has sort of sort of to

739
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,020
separate the the fix the process stuff

740
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,020
versus stay away from stuff that could

741
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,700
get us into legal trouble and then a

742
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,020
separate thing could be used I think

743
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,600
would be useful to say how how our

744
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,360
process enables the ietf to work in its

745
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,380
unique way

746
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,419
right and and it does work right I want

747
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,580
to reiterate that right especially post

748
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,380
the creation of the trust that we have

749
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,419
the the the process is very streamlined

750
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,220
there's an automatic intake and an

751
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,659
automatic copyright that goes back and

752
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,240
so that is all great yeah right the uh

753
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,260
the

754
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,000
I think sort of it might be sort of a

755
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,679
misunderstanding of my part but when I

756
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,080
read the words asset registry so what I

757
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,760
think we have at the moment is an asset

758
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,340
type registry you have basically a bunch

759
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,080
of barrels and they are labeled like pre

760
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,880
whatever the number is post whatever the

761
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,960
number is

762
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,860
um badges logos recordings right

763
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,419
um so there's there's buckets and they

764
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,980
say this bucket is license under this

765
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,620
thing or unknown right but it's not an

766
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,080
actual register where you see what is in

767
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,179
it but then I had a discussion earlier

768
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,679
with some other trustees where like I

769
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,299
asked for like as examples where the

770
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,880
badges right and it turns out that the

771
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
the list of badges is actually on an

772
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,840
ietf.org website

773
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,820
and if that is the if that is the

774
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,440
register that the trust is using to keep

775
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,299
track of the badges that should be

776
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,580
reflected by the trust so that the ITF

777
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,500
knows that you are charging us with

778
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,179
keeping that list current and we will do

779
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,360
so but I thought maybe naively that you

780
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,220
would do that as the trust right because

781
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,840
that you're the organization that

782
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,940
actually holds these as I I'm not I mean

783
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,799
keeping in mind that until until I

784
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,419
showed up there was no asset register at

785
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,400
all right so no no I I think the asset

786
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,779
register could be improved but I think

787
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,159
we need to understand that you know it's

788
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,720
going to grow from 12 entries to 40

789
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,100
entries it's not it's not going to grow

790
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,380
to 9 000 entries and that is that is a

791
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,539
fun thing and and I fully agree that the

792
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,779
the trust has immensely improved over

793
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,640
the last few years right and maybe I

794
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,720
should have said that in a document but

795
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,940
I will say it now right I'm I'm not at

796
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,679
all saying that the trajectory hasn't

797
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,600
been incredibly good going you know

798
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,100
forward from the last few years right

799
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,980
point of order yep I think you guys are

800
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,779
actually not dispatching at this point

801
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,419
yeah anyway so anyway all right so

802
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:41,340
basically so to summarize I think we

803
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,159
should dispatch it but with as with more

804
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,360
assistance from people who are familiar

805
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,039
with do you want to dispatch me some

806
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,240
co-authors that's what I hear you know

807
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,860
and and I think we need this other

808
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,260
document that is you know I would not

809
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,340
call it

810
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,380
um iatf licenses For Dummies but

811
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,000
something like that would you call it

812
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,380
operational guidelines for Asset

813
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,240
Management yeah well the only reason I

814
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,380
couldn't use for dummies is I don't

815
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,700
think my I don't think my publisher

816
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,640
would license me the trademark

817
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,980
Leslie

818
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,760
hi hello uh Leslie Daigle and in the

819
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,380
delightful position of not wearing any

820
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,360
hats not having any hats to wear at this

821
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,140
point however comma uh the less slightly

822
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,820
less delightful position of not only

823
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,500
having been on the trust when it was

824
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,960
first formed but also knowing why it was

825
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,100
created so on and so forth the

826
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,899
but the the thing that I wanted to say

827
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,419
was largely I agree with Ted's points

828
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,039
so if you want to move forward with this

829
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,840
document I think it is absolutely 100

830
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,360
within the scope for the ietf to be

831
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,279
discussing a document about what the

832
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,299
ietf needs from the management of its uh

833
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,059
of the the material it's handled by its

834
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,700
trust I think anything that that is an

835
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,799
opinion or a perspective on how it's

836
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,740
operating is out uh we this is not the

837
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,720
venue to have those discussions and you

838
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,399
know you need a litmus test

839
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,380
would you be standing here saying this

840
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,940
is what I can does well and this is what

841
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,320
I can isn't doing well and how they

842
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,179
should hold their meetings

843
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,100
um I don't I don't think he would if I

844
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,020
ever have to look into them who knows

845
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,000
but uh don't intend yeah but I mean so

846
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,700
the point being have

847
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,779
Courage the

848
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,520
to have the discussions in whatever

849
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,320
venue you think but it's their

850
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,899
discussion to have but having a document

851
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,640
that is clear about what the ietf needs

852
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,620
from its dress makes good sense take all

853
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,000
the opinions up

854
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,299
Fair Point and and I I fully um uh admit

855
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,980
that there are things in there that that

856
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,320
remain from my personal notes and they

857
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,700
probably

858
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,500
another revision before zero zero

859
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,640
wouldn't have been the worst thing to do

860
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,820
but uh if we are where we are thank you

861
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,960
come on

862
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,220
well no sorry rich

863
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,600
I guess I don't have to announce my name

864
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,919
now right this

865
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,059
um

866
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,640
so even before the discussion that the

867
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,260
car at the mic before I looked at the

868
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,120
document and the title and I'm like no

869
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,620
this really needs a working group to

870
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,299
actually that's the mechanism by which

871
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,460
we really get ITF consensus

872
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,899
um and the other arguments that people

873
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,960
have made Ted Leslie and someone John

874
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,419
um reinforce that opinion so yeah let's

875
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,640
spin up a working group

876
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,640
under gen I don't care so technically

877
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,020
it's the last call that established the

878
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,399
consensus but I hear your point that

879
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,020
venue for discussion like a working

880
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,000
group is probably a very helpful way of

881
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,159
getting there without a thousand emails

882
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,360
if we have to have this discussion

883
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,919
during last call it's going to be the

884
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:30,840
longest last call in history

885
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,140
except maybe PK but yeah

886
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,640
Glenn

887
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,159
hi there I'm I'm Glenn Dean and I'm

888
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,820
TF trustories yeah I'm Glenn Dean and I

889
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,919
am the current ITF trust chair and that

890
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,899
puts me into a weird position of

891
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,899
seeing the inside and the outside and

892
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,779
um but a couple points first of all uh

893
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,760
one of the points you made was we don't

894
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,919
do office hours that has been fixed in

895
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,159
itf150 we have office hours they are

896
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,000
Thursday at 1 to 2 p.m please show up I

897
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,620
used to do office hours when I was on

898
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,899
the LLC nobody ever showed up and I was

899
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,419
very lonely so please come

900
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:10,559
and it also occurred to be looking

901
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,000
around the room here it would be

902
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,320
interesting to do a show of hands about

903
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,059
asking me to do it but how many people

904
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,559
in the room are a current or past

905
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,000
trustee because we got a lot of them in

906
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,919
this room it's we've had a grand history

907
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,779
you know a lot of people don't realize

908
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:25,260
the trust was created in 2005 and uh

909
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,299
because you know we've had people come

910
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,679
and go through the ioc and a lot of

911
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,940
other people there's a lot of Trustees

912
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,860
have been out there uh and we got a

913
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,019
grand tradition of people being part of

914
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,320
the community and helping there uh I

915
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,700
wanted to clarify one thing you said

916
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,159
Lars and you said that the trust holds

917
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,220
assets like or it holds like pictures

918
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,039
and stuff technically we don't actually

919
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,740
hold the pictures they're managed by

920
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,360
whoever just like the data tracker

921
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,340
manages all the drafts we hold the

922
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,980
rights to them not the assets so we're

923
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,039
not in charge with of

924
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,720
physically storing or making available

925
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,240
the assets we're in charge of holding

926
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,519
the rights and then managing the

927
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,699
licenses by which those assets are used

928
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,199
legally

929
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,179
um so just a bit of clarification that

930
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,899
are helpful thank you

931
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,060
Stephen

932
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm only missing Kathleen and Victor I

933
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,760
think the picture has a different

934
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,679
appointment he mentioned this morning

935
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,899
Kathleen is not here so

936
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,300
um Stefan Wenger um currently still

937
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,960
sitting trusty for the isg uh

938
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,080
one request here that would be

939
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,239
um I think it's inadequate as it was

940
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,239
already pointed out to go too deep into

941
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,760
the content of this document if we were

942
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,980
I would recuse myself because this

943
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,560
document

944
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,540
unfortunately and certainly without bad

945
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,379
intentions includes

946
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,060
statements where I would be

947
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,040
uncomfortable to comment in public on

948
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,980
because of the personal liability I have

949
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,839
being a trustee

950
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,200
yeah there is stuff in there that sharp

951
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,380
lawyer could perhaps

952
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,540
interpret as me not doing my job and

953
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,060
that would not be something I would want

954
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,839
to comment on at all right so please

955
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,839
foreign let's not continue substantial

956
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,660
this discussion about this thing as for

957
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,220
the real question here what uh

958
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,760
we are to do with this document

959
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,740
um

960
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,520
I would suggest this or to be fairly

961
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,260
heavyweight if you really want to

962
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,820
continue with it

963
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,800
a fairly heavyweight meaning working

964
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,859
group perhaps uh something like that

965
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,920
perhaps with official liaison over to

966
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,220
the other stakeholders in the uh in the

967
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,119
trust that are not part of the iitf

968
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,400
organization even if they are informal

969
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,920
channels and I know that this is not the

970
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,500
way the ITF normally works but in this

971
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,420
particular case I would rather

972
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,960
suggest doing something rather heavy

973
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,480
weight the alternative is not to do

974
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,520
anything about it

975
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,099
and quite frankly

976
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,579
um we're not we're not deaf

977
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,520
yeah this document is there right and we

978
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,160
listen to it and frankly when I was

979
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,320
appointed the advice that I got is

980
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,060
um the isg doesn't want to see project

981
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,240
reports progress reports don't send us

982
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,800
anything

983
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,140
um don't waste time on the plenaries

984
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,260
don't do all that stuff right now we

985
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,940
have now a different story that's fine

986
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,640
we can adjust to it but if this draft

987
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,200
we're just going away quietly and

988
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,240
informal channels to the trustees were

989
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,359
employed to

990
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,920
um

991
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,599
you know uh

992
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,520
complain if you want

993
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,740
or to suggest

994
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,060
uh

995
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,780
were used rather than starting up this

996
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,240
whole machine Machinery that would be in

997
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,220
my opinion the best way forward

998
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,260
things that don't continue that doesn't

999
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,180
give good advice and also sort of when

1000
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,560
Ted mentioned the point earlier about

1001
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,000
the working group I was

1002
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,800
fearing that a working group might

1003
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,240
become a very heavyweight mechanism

1004
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,520
which made me say that I it might

1005
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,520
convince me to you know you don't want

1006
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,560
to do this lightweight this is this is

1007
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,420
too scary stuff to do it lightweight

1008
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,880
really thank you

1009
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,700
Alyssa

1010
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,020
sorry I didn't read this when you sent

1011
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,820
it to me before that's number one what

1012
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,200
I know

1013
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,500
um number two is that I think so I agree

1014
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,700
with the people who have said I think

1015
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,619
you need a working group for this also

1016
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,119
sorry

1017
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,040
um and but part of the reason also is

1018
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,579
because I think the Ina IPR agreement

1019
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:01,560
requires uh actual formal communication

1020
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,440
through the ccg because this would touch

1021
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,240
on things that are implicated by that

1022
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,880
agreement that's just my opinion um

1023
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
having been involved in the drafting of

1024
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,880
that agreement

1025
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,339
um so I I just think it's uh for the

1026
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,440
purposes of maintaining good relations

1027
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,960
with the communities involved in the

1028
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,119
other assets I think you would want it

1029
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,619
to be kind of buttoned up process and

1030
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,119
not like let's hand it to somebody and

1031
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,880
do it a d sponsored

1032
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,119
um I think and I guess this is maybe

1033
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,520
just the last thing is that um I think

1034
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,440
part of the some of the things that you

1035
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,820
point out reflect a um

1036
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,980
long-standing uh

1037
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,540
greater need for more administrative

1038
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,300
support for the iitf trust

1039
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,280
um and I think that maybe it's not

1040
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,780
lacking anymore but it was for many

1041
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,300
years of its existence and um and that's

1042
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,859
I think we're seeing the vestiges of

1043
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,619
some of that sort of under investment

1044
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,720
um and you know I was one of the people

1045
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,420
who really thought that having the trust

1046
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,579
assets moved to the ITF LLC would that

1047
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,960
that would have kind of killed two birds

1048
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,339
with one stone

1049
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,960
um and it's it's too bad that we're not

1050
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,640
going down that path I also it would

1051
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,200
have also you wouldn't have had to think

1052
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,180
about the funding problem either

1053
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,640
um but now you do so

1054
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,859
um that that's just an observation that

1055
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,119
uh you know

1056
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,280
it's good to get the communities

1057
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,560
um requirements documented but having

1058
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,260
the operational processes which are

1059
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,420
documented separately and and manifest

1060
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,280
separately in the trust itself I think

1061
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,740
is actually the more not necessarily the

1062
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,880
more important piece but an equally

1063
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,680
important piece of

1064
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,880
um fixing some of the issues that you

1065
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,500
identified thank you

1066
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,020
um Bob

1067
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,680
um hi so I'm I'm one of the I think many

1068
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,440
former trustees here too

1069
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,540
um I think I agreed a lot with what

1070
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,060
Leslie said

1071
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,680
um

1072
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,680
that you know if this is a

1073
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,619
communication from the IHF to the trust

1074
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,599
about what it needs and perhaps isn't

1075
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,400
getting now or it thinks something like

1076
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,920
that I think that's good but I'm I'm not

1077
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,500
sure if this having the itaf tell the

1078
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,740
trust it needs to do things differently

1079
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,119
would be the right thing I think that

1080
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,480
will get very complicated really quickly

1081
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,200
um so this is a set of if this is a set

1082
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,359
of requirements from the itaf to the

1083
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,339
trust I think it's fine and I don't

1084
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,099
think that creates legal Jeopardy as far

1085
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:33,180
as I can tell so and yeah whatever the

1086
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,160
best I don't have a strong opinion about

1087
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,900
a working group or a list or something

1088
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,240
but something

1089
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,400
thanks

1090
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,320
man that it gets shorter and it gets

1091
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,660
longer again higlin

1092
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,640
either glendeen again

1093
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,079
um I just wanted to just for people in

1094
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,820
the room just to know we've talked a lot

1095
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,440
about the funding thing and it's not

1096
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,420
like we're ignoring it uh we're having

1097
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,220
active conversations between the trust

1098
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,380
and the LLC we're trying to figure it

1099
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,000
out we got tax lawyers looking at things

1100
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,400
people who know these rules very really

1101
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,020
well are advising all of us and we're

1102
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,220
trying to figure it out so I think

1103
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,780
that's a really good sign that we're

1104
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,040
working well together because you know

1105
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,839
we identified there's a concern and a

1106
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,000
worry and we're working together

1107
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,839
um

1108
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:16,260
but I will say I I do think that we did

1109
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,060
suffer greatly during covet because uh

1110
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,500
you know if you if you look at the

1111
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,200
Timeline we did iasa all the new Isa

1112
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,320
sort of restructuring really took place

1113
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,500
March 2019. we had you know one meeting

1114
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,119
where we all got recognized hey we're

1115
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,880
all going to do hats we had two meetings

1116
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,740
that we sort of said okay we're wearing

1117
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,880
the Hat we're interact with everybody

1118
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,280
and then we had no more in-person

1119
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,820
meetings and I think that we're some

1120
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,040
rough edges there got created just

1121
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,480
because we couldn't see each other and

1122
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,760
one of the things I found really helpful

1123
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,520
this week this is because I was in my

1124
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,700
hotel room sick with covid at itf-14 I

1125
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,740
didn't get to see anybody uh even though

1126
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,200
I was at the ITF Hotel it's really been

1127
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,000
wonderful getting to see everybody this

1128
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,500
week and actually interact you and I

1129
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,180
think it's it really helped a lot of the

1130
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,339
you know like getting back into the flow

1131
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:11,040
of things so correct I think I guess

1132
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,300
what I'm trying to say is I think the

1133
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,040
future looks very bright

1134
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,780
I agree and also the the I mentioned

1135
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,359
before this this is I'll be structuring

1136
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,619
that there's no Personnel overlap

1137
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,079
anymore kovit certainly magnified the

1138
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,520
impact of that because we couldn't even

1139
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,680
like meet each other in the bar like it

1140
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,920
there was always an informal way to chat

1141
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,740
that was sort of taken out and then you

1142
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,720
know everybody was scrambling to just

1143
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,280
get their work done in their immediate

1144
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,900
circle like in the ISU or the LLC board

1145
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,640
or the trust right and you can't really

1146
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,119
take on social chats over Zoom um you

1147
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,700
can't and I also like uh highly um

1148
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,960
there's another point I want to make and

1149
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,060
I forgot sorry which was one of the

1150
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,720
things that happened in iso2 is the IAD

1151
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,460
um world went away because we now have a

1152
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,140
different role for that but the idea

1153
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,339
used to be on the trust and they used to

1154
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,780
provide a lot of administrative support

1155
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,420
and as the trust chair one of my first

1156
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,240
challenges was gee how much of this work

1157
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,560
am I going to take on and how much of

1158
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,359
this work can I you know get some other

1159
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,040
kind of stuff that people to work on and

1160
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,079
that's been fun but I think we've got no

1161
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,420
I think we should continue right because

1162
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,579
the the incorporation will cause you

1163
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:17,760
some additional need for oh I support

1164
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,180
and so yes I understand yes I agree

1165
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Leslie

1166
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,780
um so my previous comments were

1167
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,160
addressed to you on the topic of this

1168
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,839
particular document that I felt I wanted

1169
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,520
to reinforce some points in the context

1170
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,280
of your role as the ITF chair and

1171
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,200
anything the ITF May care to take on is

1172
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,520
work

1173
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,319
um I think the discussion about whether

1174
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,180
or not there's a light working group or

1175
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,740
a heavy working group is really

1176
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,480
teetering on the edge of whether people

1177
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,099
are going to talk about what the ietf

1178
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,500
needs to have from whatever manages its

1179
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,599
trust assets versus If people really

1180
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,400
want to dig in how do you want to do the

1181
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,900
funding and how do you want to do the

1182
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,180
how do you want to do it right and and I

1183
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,579
don't think that's an ietf working group

1184
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:02,099
unless you convince the trust the trust

1185
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,920
would like to use iatf resources to have

1186
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,180
that conversation

1187
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,940
so

1188
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,099
again back to the we don't tell I can we

1189
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:12,960
don't write documents to I can about how

1190
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,280
they should restructure themselves let's

1191
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,900
not do it to the trust

1192
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,020
so doesn't there's nothing about

1193
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,940
restructuring in this right and the the

1194
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,980
financial thing I left at a very high

1195
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,900
level specifically because I I basically

1196
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,760
think it is the intention of the ITF

1197
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,020
community that we want to see our trust

1198
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,119
well funded right and and that is sort

1199
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,220
of the you know the expectations not

1200
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,900
only the expectation that the community

1201
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,880
has on the trust but it's also on the

1202
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,599
LLC as the financial and legal yeah the

1203
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,760
ietf requires that the trust whatever is

1204
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,560
looking after it's it's

1205
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,260
resources will will actually continue to

1206
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,540
exist and be and be viable and and not

1207
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,660
subjected to you know whatever will not

1208
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,640
crumble on in the face of a of a legal

1209
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,800
action that's that's all fair game is a

1210
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,380
requirement uh but I think that Stefan

1211
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,000
captured it well when he said that a lot

1212
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,380
of the other things that people are kind

1213
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,660
of edging into are really hard to talk

1214
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,280
about in public

1215
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,200
um and and that's that's really not part

1216
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,599
of the iatf space to lay down

1217
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,460
requirements correct and the community

1218
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,619
has delegated us to the LLC specifically

1219
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,839
for that reason right correct

1220
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,680
Maya

1221
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,819
yeah I'm listening to this conversation

1222
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,740
and there was a lot of times there was

1223
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,599
this word informal communication and

1224
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,400
it's great we should all sit together in

1225
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,720
a bar and drink a beer and like make

1226
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,119
sure we like one Community but I'm

1227
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,380
actually I don't want to rely on that

1228
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,180
and that's what what has shown over the

1229
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,339
last um two or three years that if we

1230
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,480
don't have these informal channels

1231
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,220
there's something missing so that's my

1232
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,400
take away from this conversation so

1233
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,640
um this and this document is is a is an

1234
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,560
outcome out of this problem and the

1235
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,119
problem I think as you said existed

1236
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,800
since we restructured everything else

1237
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,380
and forgot maybe some angle there so um

1238
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,300
I I think I would like a work in group

1239
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,339
to work on on that problem not only for

1240
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:57,900
your document but it's maybe a slightly

1241
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,940
broader problem and it's not like it's

1242
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,560
not necessarily it's not like how they

1243
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,180
trust organize itself but it's really

1244
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,180
about this relationship between the iitf

1245
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,680
and the trust where there seems to be

1246
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,440
something missing that we should fix

1247
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,940
but as somebody who's getting

1248
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,260
increasingly convinced that the working

1249
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,460
group would be

1250
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,480
um

1251
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,060
burning a lot of energy

1252
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,200
um and and maybe come up with something

1253
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,000
so I'm wondering if a pragmatic solution

1254
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,680
would be to establish some form of

1255
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,319
informal liaison which which we can do

1256
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,880
right we just need to agree to do it and

1257
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,380
we don't need to change any documents to

1258
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,140
do that and see where that takes us as I

1259
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,760
said I think I mean I'm not sure how

1260
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,619
informal the liaison is but like I think

1261
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,060
it should not be informed it should be

1262
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,920
formal right and maybe that's a

1263
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,480
completely different document I want I'm

1264
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,280
not not 100 sure it needs a working

1265
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,960
group and but there's something we need

1266
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,740
to fix

1267
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,680
when the LLC for example could just

1268
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,500
state that we're you know we're charging

1269
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,780
somebody with with observing the the

1270
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,400
trust right and the trust could do the

1271
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,380
opposite and that would sort of be

1272
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,480
something like a liaison right where you

1273
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,220
have people that sort of are invited to

1274
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,380
the meetings and so on and so forth

1275
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,300
um Alyssa

1276
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,880
I just had a question about the point

1277
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,220
that Stefan raised and and Leslie

1278
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,079
pointed to around the personal liability

1279
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,240
of the trustees because when Stefan was

1280
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,619
talking about it I was assuming this is

1281
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:18,599
something that would resolve itself with

1282
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,599
the incorporation uh in Delaware and

1283
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,520
therefore should you Charter a working

1284
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,319
group and have discussion about this

1285
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,660
after that point the trustees should

1286
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,619
feel completely comfortable

1287
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,000
participating as members of the

1288
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,619
community but then unless it was talking

1289
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,000
about it it sounded like that wouldn't

1290
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,980
be the case so I was wanting

1291
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,780
clarification around that so my

1292
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,220
understanding is the same as yours that

1293
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,900
the the incorporation would basically

1294
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,540
indemnify that the um I guess then

1295
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,460
directors of the corporation

1296
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,780
it's not quite that simple because and

1297
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,760
of course as an as a director of a

1298
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,960
corporation you have also certain

1299
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,280
Corrections right to be able to get

1300
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,859
insurance for you that yeah we can buy

1301
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,440
insurance in that case which otherwise

1302
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,839
we can't that doesn't that doesn't

1303
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,359
allow us just to be careless right of

1304
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,720
course but yes uh so so clearly my

1305
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,440
personal Comfort level uh will go up by

1306
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,140
several notches the second where uh

1307
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,980
the

1308
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,619
um non-profit Corporation is actually

1309
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:22,560
active yeah not with that it started but

1310
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,460
that that basically I can

1311
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,280
I can say that I have withdrawn from the

1312
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,220
trust and not a trust anymore or that

1313
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,380
whatever I say if you have to keep the

1314
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,880
Trust on the books for a few years just

1315
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,060
just for for whatever weird reason we

1316
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,460
can do that and I can sit there but that

1317
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,920
whatever I say I don't say as a trust is

1318
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,599
but as a director of the of the

1319
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,400
corporation so sorry for jumping the

1320
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,740
cube I don't I think that may have been

1321
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,440
have been helpful thank you

1322
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,420
okay just a reminder to those of you

1323
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,980
already in the queue we're going to

1324
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,599
close the queue shortly as well we have

1325
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,359
just 10 minutes left of this session

1326
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,940
okay thanks I'll be brief Jason yeah

1327
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,640
Jason loving good uh with my actual sort

1328
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,760
of virtual LC uh chair hat on

1329
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,200
um just for the avoidance of any doubt

1330
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,300
like if people think that this draft in

1331
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,940
some way reflects a conflict between the

1332
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,119
trust and the LLC that's not the case in

1333
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,500
fact we're taking advantage of the fact

1334
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,780
that Glenn is not sick this week uh

1335
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,240
thankfully to have a joint uh meeting uh

1336
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,099
between the two organizations face to

1337
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,380
face which would be nice and recent

1338
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,540
discussions we've had are things like we

1339
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,160
have this wonderful matching uh

1340
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,380
fundraising agreement from isoc are

1341
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,819
there ways that we can take advantage of

1342
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:38,220
that to sort of Turbo Charge any funds

1343
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,119
that

1344
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,440
um people may want to give to the trust

1345
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,480
as as a way to you know basically double

1346
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,720
or triple um funding so that's just at a

1347
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,460
high level and you know we are putting

1348
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,680
money in for the 2023 budget for them to

1349
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,839
help bootstrap the new structure and so

1350
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,000
on

1351
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,180
foreign

1352
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,560
so the reason why I went into the queue

1353
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,079
is basically to say I'm exactly the same

1354
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:05,760
thing as just said uh it's it's probably

1355
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,980
wise uh to finish one thing

1356
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,220
before we start another right and that

1357
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,200
one thing that's going on and has been

1358
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,079
going on for a year is is this is this

1359
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,700
restructuring that's well on its way

1360
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,700
that will be finished at some point and

1361
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,460
then we can start another construction

1362
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,180
but uh unless someone really thinks that

1363
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,819
the two things are directly interrelated

1364
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:36,540
which is not what I heard here uh let's

1365
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,160
finish one project first before we

1366
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,500
tackle the next thank you thanks

1367
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,839
there's an empty queue

1368
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,400
all right so I guess you are charged

1369
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,619
with the um

1370
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,660
yeah so um well I've definitely had a

1371
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,859
lot of interest from the community

1372
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,119
thanks everyone for your questions

1373
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,980
participation

1374
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,079
um it sounds like uh there's a call

1375
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,700
generally that this shouldn't be done by

1376
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,280
ad solely and if he goes forward would

1377
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,220
need a working group some discussion

1378
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,380
um or else the document can change in

1379
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,700
either case the document needs a

1380
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,700
revision to be clear on what is and

1381
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,920
isn't out of scope uh if you wanted to

1382
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,079
take it forward

1383
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:17,460
that's what I had I think I mean this

1384
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,440
was helpful thank you for forcing me to

1385
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,300
show slides

1386
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,460
um so so my sort of takeaway is that I

1387
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,020
will basically let this live for a while

1388
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,599
and and so and you might expect I'm

1389
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,160
around all week if you want to talk to

1390
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,599
me about any of this please feel free

1391
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,420
I'll be at the reception tonight for

1392
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,980
example hanging out and looking at art

1393
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,660
and we can chat

1394
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,319
um personally I you know I understand

1395
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,780
that if people want to do this a working

1396
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,119
group would be the right thing but I

1397
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,740
also think it would be a very complex

1398
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,140
thing to take on and I wonder if it's

1399
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,540
worth it and I personally certainly feel

1400
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,099
that I don't have the time for it

1401
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,680
frankly and I also think I'm in the role

1402
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,480
where I can't do this or I shouldn't do

1403
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,700
this I probably shouldn't have read the

1404
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,040
written the document but it I happen to

1405
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,480
have notes

1406
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,400
um so I'm basically sort of letting this

1407
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,260
live for a while so that we can all like

1408
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,020
have a think or something and chat for a

1409
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,660
little bit and then we can figure out if

1410
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,819
there's energy to do something or if not

1411
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,099
doing anything is also a fine thing

1412
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:20,760
we'll see but uh thanks for the feedback

1413
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,640
and I'll see you

1414
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,099
of course

1415
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:27,900
I would like to say officially for the

1416
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,240
trust represent with my hat on we do

1417
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,819
want to hear from you so like I process

1418
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,800
aside we really really really do want to

1419
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,900
hear from you so talk to us open hours

1420
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,240
we're there I'm around other trustees

1421
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,859
are around we're sending email we're

1422
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,160
friendly

1423
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,319
great well thank you very much for

1424
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,940
coming to present and like you say a

1425
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,260
good forcing function to give you time

1426
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,240
on the agenda that did move forward

1427
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,400
considerably faster than the time it

1428
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,960
would have taken on the mailing list so

1429
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,700
would you say thanks to everyone that

1430
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,200
gave your opinion and your view thanks

1431
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,819
for keeping the conversation productive

1432
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:02,339
as well and we do have some Flex time

1433
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:04,079
and time for any other business if

1434
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,339
there's anything anyone would like to

1435
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,180
bring to you the mic

1436
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:15,079
going once going twice

1437
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,059
Eggert um as uh gen 80 on an unrelated

1438
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:22,500
issue so

1439
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,839
um You probably saw that we did a PR

1440
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,480
action announcement and it had a last

1441
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,760
call discussion that was pretty long one

1442
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,140
point that was brought up during this

1443
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,599
last call discussion that there's a

1444
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,099
significant number of people I would say

1445
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:36,960
you know not a few but but quite many

1446
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,680
that suggested that BCP 83 and maybe the

1447
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,220
broader moderation mechanisms and

1448
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,339
process that we use in the iitf for our

1449
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,380
participation channels need a rethink

1450
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,680
right and so if if people have energy to

1451
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,780
take that on this would be something

1452
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,599
that would be dispatched here right I

1453
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:58,559
would

1454
00:53:58,559 --> 00:53:59,180
um

1455
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,880
encourage that we if we start that

1456
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,160
we start with a bunch of people that

1457
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,540
maybe met in a bar or somewhere else

1458
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,660
come with a I want to say fully fleshed

1459
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,920
out proposal but at least something that

1460
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,079
can be read and you know discussed about

1461
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:15,119
to some detail

1462
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,619
rather than like starting with an email

1463
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,119
or something like that

1464
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,160
so thank you

1465
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,559
great thank you

1466
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,000
um and Braun you're in the queue

1467
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,780
yes thank you I wanted to talk about

1468
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,059
that here and I had a clash but

1469
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,559
thankfully my session finished on time

1470
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,720
so I've snuck up here to dive in I

1471
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,160
definitely think there's some work to be

1472
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,500
done in this area particularly around

1473
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,480
saying that that maybe some of the forms

1474
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,220
of communication that have been used in

1475
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,099
the past on iitf lists while they are

1476
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,380
part of English and not necessarily the

1477
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,140
best forms to use for communication in a

1478
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,940
global audience that we have so

1479
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,800
particularly some of the forms of humor

1480
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,359
and sarcasm

1481
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:55,020
um

1482
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,780
that that kind of thing if we say

1483
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,940
they're not recommended and if you if

1484
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,200
someone pointed out that the correct

1485
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,839
response is sorry my bad rather than I

1486
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,579
have a right to communicate in this

1487
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:08,460
style is a good path to to work forwards

1488
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,920
from on that um so I'm definitely

1489
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,119
interested in being involved in the

1490
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,559
discussions on this

1491
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,599
I think it's it's work that we need to

1492
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,680
do

1493
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,599
sounds dangerous to go to volunteering

1494
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,520
their brand to write such a proposal I

1495
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,839

1496
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,720
