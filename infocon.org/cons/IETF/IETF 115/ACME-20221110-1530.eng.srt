00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,780
much progress in the other stuff and

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,639

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,860
rfcs the last one was published in

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,480
uh September of uh last year

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,319
um but we're going to break this uh bad

50
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,239
streak because

51
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,360
um

52
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,819
Authority token is approved and it's

53
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,420
going to be in the RFC and tsq so

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,080
with some chance of having it uh

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,099
um published before 116. okay Acme

56
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,080
client has just been allowed to expire

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,860
with uh no continued interest Ari is now

58
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,500
a working group draft

59
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,140
um Authority token TN auth list we've

60
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,000
had versions nine and ten submitted

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,599
since Philadelphia and still has some

62
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,040
discusses that require a vision but

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,920
nothing that seems uh to me at least

64
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
major

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
so I think we have a status on this

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,040
right yeah right

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,459
as for detail node ID we also have we're

68
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,379
also going to talk about that but the

69
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,220
latest revision is from September

70
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,840
sure so I think we want to talk about

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
the Acme the The Authority token in the

72
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
TN loss list a little bit

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,780
hi this is Remington Elio responsible Ag

74
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,799
and uh yeah talking about the dtn one

75
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,780
I don't know which slide kind of we want

76
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,940
I I want to get a sense for what the

77
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,519
plan is here because I'm starting to

78
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,980
feel like we took this document too

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,459
early so as I rewind the history we

80
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,680
started the document then dtn changed on

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,200
us we had to rev the document and then

82
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,780
we revved it and then we were ready to

83
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,940
go ahead and then we decided oh wait

84
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,860
wait there's registry stuff so we got

85
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,720
dtn needs to make another change for us

86
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,340
and we've been waiting a really really

87
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,540
long time

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,659
it seems like we need to rewind all the

89
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,019
way back park it and wait for dtn to

90
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,120
tell us how to play it so we have we

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,858
have Brian doing a briefing like a five

92
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,600
minute briefing on this in a minute okay

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,940
sorry

94
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,540
can we do the 10

95
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,460
th so now go back one slide sorry a

96
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,940
little little

97
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,280
so Acme Authority token and tianos

98
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,080
so Authority token's good to go right

99
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,759
we're good on that one it's the Tian

100
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,560
auth one that's that's great yeah

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
there's still some lingering issues

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,020
there this I'm sorry this is John

103
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,460
Peterson I don't

104
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,100
yeah I put myself in the queue um but

105
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,780
yeah so we do still have some work to do

106
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,100
on that I know I've been talking to

107
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,780
Chris went a bit this week about it and

108
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,660
so we expect to have that shortly okay

109
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,160
um I'm not personally editing that one

110
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
but um yeah we did take our Authority so

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,180
do you think shortly is like next week

112
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,759
or next month or next year or next let's

113
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,259
say in December

114
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,120
December okay well that's not too far

115
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,740
that's a couple of that's next month a

116
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,120
couple of weeks right yeah okay because

117
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
I know I'm out of pocket pretty much

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,419
until then anyway so okay yeah

119
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,280
done and it's just a question of who's

120
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,500
whose token this is going to end up with

121
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,780
among the author team we want to get

122
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,539
this done right yeah yeah I mean from my

123
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,160
side room I mean I completely concur I

124
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
think this they are very small changes

125
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,160
we just need to make some quick edits

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,840
okay okay all right lean on him

127
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,320
now

128
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,419
so

129
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,280
in a minute we'll talk about uh Acme

130
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
Integrations there's a new version uh

131
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,259
from September it's in a b evaluation

132
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,680
and still revised AP needed

133
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,979
so this one we've got

134
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,900
expired personal drafts

135
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,560
this is the tip Elliott Lear one

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,539
so I don't know what the plan is here

137
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,940
and they're not is Michael Richardson in

138
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,320
the room no

139
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,639
so I don't know what the plan is here

140
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,020
but I think we need to chase them a

141
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,258
little bit

142
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,120
um because I don't how much time does

143
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,360
Elliot have to be posting teeth drafts

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,300
anyway that's that one okay

145
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,620
okay so uh next uh and there's Acme

146
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,319
subdomains and no new revision and it's

147
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,380
in my TF last call

148
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,780
and that one should be fine I think

149
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,039
yeah

150
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,840
Okay so

151
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,259
that done we can move to the to the

152
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,039
promised dtn node ID presentation so uh

153
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,419
could you all right Brian

154
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,919
I think you all can drive the slides for

155
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,479
you if that's okay with you

156
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
yeah either way

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,639
yeah

158
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,860
uh some friends even sleep PL uh you can

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,160
switch the next slide

160
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,380
foreign

161
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,139
so there was a dash 10 release that

162
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,160
corrected some typos and added some uh

163
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
explanations of what is the experimental

164
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,380
nature of of this protocol and it's

165
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,919
experimental in the sense of uh the dtn

166
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,680
doing what it needs to do side and not

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,259
experimental in the sense of

168
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,680
um will it be usable and testable and

169
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,900
will it properly integrate with the Acme

170
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,860
client uh and then one last little bit

171
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,039
is that the hash algorithms that this

172
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,280
was referencing have made it to RFC 9054

173
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,639
which is good uh the issue remaining and

174
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,940
what Roman had mentioned earlier is that

175
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,660
um

176
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,380
it's it's a a bit of a bookkeeping issue

177
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,759
that is we're allocating a code point we

178
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,960
need the place to put the code point

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,419
there was an eye and a registry but it

180
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,180
was not properly updated

181
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,419
in the dtn working group as actually in

182
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,560
between the time these slides were

183
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,099
prepared and today the dkm working group

184
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,819
has adopted the document that corrects

185
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,520
the Ayana registry

186
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,960
and at this point it seems like if Acme

187
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,240
working group is happy with this

188
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,160
document as is

189
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,900
and

190
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,379
it can live in a state that is waiting

191
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,479
in a kind of an approval cluster with

192
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,360
the associated dtn document that updates

193
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,099
the Ina registry

194
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,659
then they can

195
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,979
travel

196
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,159
through later stages together the only

197
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
thing that that other companion document

198
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,140
does is update the Ina registry so it's

199
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,339
very small it's uh

200
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:54,839
uncontroversial in what it's doing and

201
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,120
there's agreement that it's needed

202
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,860
so is there is it a working group

203
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,979
it is now yes

204
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,240
responsible ID so we are currently

205
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,920
sitting in this document in a halfway

206
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,540
state it is out of the word group it's

207
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,140
in my hand so we uh we have not yet sent

208
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,899
it to the isg given where we've been

209
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,700
with this document it's I'm going to

210
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,800
keep it there until I see the dtn

211
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,480
document progress a lot you know a

212
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
little further because practically

213
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,600
there's no difference between keeping it

214
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
in Miss ref versus here and this

215
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,620
document would get discussed on anyway

216
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,200
for not having the kind of the Ayanna

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,660
thing sorted out so it's one you know

218
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,339
you know whatever the expression half

219
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,800
dozen or kind of another so we're going

220
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,899
to kind of park it uh until we move

221
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:43,860
forward

222
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,959
and I think that's a reasonable thing to

223
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,040
do

224
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,040
um knowing that the only dependence here

225
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,500
is where to put the code Point not any

226
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,899
more complicated interrelationship so

227
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,160
the fact that there's a Code point being

228
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,740
allocated and it's going into a registry

229
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,779
uh that's all that matters for the

230
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,760
dependency

231
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,399
and we don't care

232
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,440
I think about the specific code point or

233
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,220
anything

234
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,839
right so I think we're squared away from

235
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,940
an Acme point of view I think from a dtn

236
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,320
point of view Stephen and I are going to

237
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,200
go talk to somebody sometime

238
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,760
about other other parts of dtn maybe

239
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,420
um

240
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,760
algorithm choices perhaps things like

241
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,540
that

242
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,399
um but we'll handle that offline it's

243
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,920
obviously not an acne business so

244
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,279
um all right so Roman's happy

245
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,680
and it's a working group draft I think

246
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,140
we're good we'll let it we'll let it sit

247
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,519
for the minute

248
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,500
it's just we have like 200 drafts

249
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,180
sitting in like limbo at this point

250
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,700
right we'll call it that parked with the

251
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,940
ad

252
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,720
right

253
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,220
right and it's like we've got four

254
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,600
drafts like this so it's a little weird

255
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,140
right so

256
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,060
no the TN drafts and the

257
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,760
no no the it depends on what you say all

258
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,200
what all the other drafts are this one

259
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
is the only one notionally parked which

260
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,000
is we we're waiting literally for

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,380
someone else to do something that's

262
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,820
outside the working group all the other

263
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,800
documents we actually very concretely

264
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,360
know what needs to get done and the

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,740
power to change it is inside the working

266
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,480
group so that's why I'm distinguishing

267
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,560
it from the perspective of the working

268
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,660
group yes they are all with me if you

269
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,760
Nuance it from my perspective the

270
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,380
actions are controllable for the working

271
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,820
room for the other three that's fine

272
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,720
yeah

273
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,330
as long as it's your problem

274
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,720
[Laughter]

275
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,060
all right cool all right

276
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,760
thank you

277
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,420
so uh next up is the the devices station

278
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,420
Brandon

279
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
so I they gave me a clicker I'm not

280
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
quite sure what the clicker

281
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,500
I'll try let's see what happens with the

282
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,920
clicker

283
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,980
hello everyone

284
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,760
who knows what the clicker I have no

285
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,880
idea what the clicker is

286
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
good it does something with the USB of

287
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
your laptop

288
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,300
no it's he's got the slides and I'm

289
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,820
driving them

290
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,800
no that was me that was

291
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,300
you can hold the clicker up

292
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,019
it's like saying next slide

293
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,899
next slide please

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,019
awesome

295
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,899
all right so uh changes from when this

296
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,579
was presented Philadelphia

297
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,920
um fairly small uh the first one was

298
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,120
clarifying that in this draft we are not

299
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,519
going to attempt to specify every single

300
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,639
possible way you validate manifestation

301
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,139
um which is really hard and there's a

302
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,660
whole working group rats for that

303
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,440
um

304
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,740
and the second is uh there was

305
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,180
discussion uh 114 about

306
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,000
uh if we should reuse the identifiers

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,519
from uh web authen exactly as they're

308
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,740
specified in WC3 or if we should create

309
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,660
a new Iron Iana registry and the

310
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,720
consensus was create a new registry so I

311
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,540
added the text that Carl added to his

312
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,360
draft which is encapsulating the exact

313
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,639
same types of attestation uh into my

314
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,820
draft so thank you Carl

315
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,560
um next slide please

316
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,440
so since Philadelphia all of the

317
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,680
discussion on the mailing list and in

318
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,440
person has been about the encapsulation

319
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,560
format for attestation statements slash

320
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,959
evidence if Hank is in the room

321
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:46,800
um

322
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,599
so there's three concurrent drafts

323
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,760
I got yelled at last year for misusing

324
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
attestation terms

325
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,959
I think the correct term is evidence but

326
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,720
no one hold me to that

327
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,019
so there's three concurrent drafts uh at

328
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,300
the ITF that all attempt to essentially

329
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,820
do the same thing which is take a vendor

330
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,480
specific attestation evidence

331
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,399
Um this can be either an x509

332
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,680
certificate with an extension or this

333
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,920
can be uh in the TPM case a bunch of

334
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
byte arrays

335
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,500
um

336
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,620
and include them either in a shift your

337
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,240
request in the case of the first two

338
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,000
drafts or in a TLS handshake in the last

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,260
draft

340
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,180
um or

341
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,230
middle draft is the TL Centric

342
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,940
[Music]

343
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,720
um

344
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,720
it seems to everyone I've spoken with

345
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,300
that the best course of action is to

346
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,139
have

347
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,760
all of these drafts use the same

348
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,860
encapsulation format

349
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,579
um

350
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,399
since uh 114

351
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,980
um the Carl Wallace's draft has been

352
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,480
adopted so that's actually wrong it's

353
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,220
draft uh lamps yellow station now uh and

354
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,740
the TLs draft has had a revision that

355
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,420
actually now moves away from the same

356
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,760
encapsulation format uh

357
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,860
that the other two drafts use so

358
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,420
this is the thing I think that needs the

359
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,060
most feedback from

360
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,899
the working group

361
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,519
specifically around how do we coordinate

362
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,639
between the different uh ITF working

363
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,980
groups to get to the same format

364
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,139
um and in the case of the TLs draft how

365
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,820
do we coordinate with an external

366
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,860
industry Consortium that is also

367
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,699
discussing the same thing

368
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,579
yeah do you wanna talk

369
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,320
I only read the middle one I spent I

370
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
actually spent some time with editors

371
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,800
this week I think it goes beyond format

372
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
it goes into use cases

373
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,300
and how do we pick how do you get

374
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,839
a certificate versus

375
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,620
an attestation document and whether the

376
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,339
one contains the other or vice versa or

377
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,440
both

378
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,540
when you when you actually look at the

379
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,120
use case of how to set up this whole

380
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,680
system it becomes really complicated and

381
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,139
you guys better coordinate

382
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,000
these things

383
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,760
even saying that there are use cases

384
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,720
like iot that that need one way of doing

385
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,720
it and and Enterprise use cases that

386
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,060
need the other way of doing it but

387
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,480
putting it on the table and and reaching

388
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,519
some sort of agreement

389
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,779
thank you

390
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,740
yeah multiple attestation schemes use

391
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,560
x59 certificates as

392
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,800
containers for attestation evidence

393
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
um and then those are during coded and

394
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,140
stuck into the encapsulation

395
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,079
um so in my draft that's borrowed from

396
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,459
the Web author and attestation statement

397
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,720
so it's just a seabor key value pair the

398
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,359
key exists in the Iana registry for the

399
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,099
attestation formats and the value is

400
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,859
whatever vendor specific thing

401
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,000
um

402
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,059
I suspect long-term sticking evidence

403
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,559
into

404
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,839
x59 search as a container is not the

405
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,780
desired outcome but that's the

406
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,860
environment we currently have

407
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,100
um I guess if there's no more discussion

408
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,360
about this next slide

409
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,360
so uh since uh one run four um there's

410
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,179
actually been two implementations uh of

411
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,760
the draft that are not by me

412
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,880
um the first exists in buried deep

413
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,620
inside Apple's managed device

414
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,860
attestation feature that exists in iOS

415
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,480
16 and TV OS something and it also

416
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,940
exists in the step CA certificate

417
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,120
Authority it's a open source Acme CA

418
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
developed by small step

419
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,580
um and I believe these two uh

420
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,500
interoperate as of today

421
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,340
response

422
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,940
and that's the end of my slides

423
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,059
is there

424
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,600
any feedback around progressing to

425
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,840
working group adoption or any other

426
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,720
feedback about that station

427
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,000
formats so I think we need to get eyes

428
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,799
on this document right we need more

429
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,539
review of it

430
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,260
um

431
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,140
when I looked at it your security

432
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,620
section basically points to webathon

433
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,679
which is sort of fun

434
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,740
um

435
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,480
I I mean we can adopt it before you're

436
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,960
solidified with what the types are but

437
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,179
I mean eventually they have to

438
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,679
I don't I don't know whether it makes

439
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,240
sense to have all like all these little

440
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,020
disparate device attestation types right

441
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,520
um

442
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,440
uh Brennan

443
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,200
um is this um do I understand correctly

444
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,120
that there are other parts of this that

445
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,760
need to come from other working groups

446
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,220
all those other documents that you

447
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,660
mentioned

448
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,620
yeah so the draft that's at the lamps

449
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,500
working group is very similar in concept

450
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,080
and except instead of extending Acme

451
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,080
it's extending CMP EST and one I forgot

452
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,520
CMC CMC

453
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
um yeah the thing is I'm seeing that

454
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,539
they're all draft somebody

455
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,460
um named working group rather than draft

456
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,539
IDF not notice

457
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,539
okay

458
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,260
yeah and then there's nothing on here

459
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,360
that references rats but this somehow

460
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,559
feels related to rats

461
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,240
I just don't want us to end up

462
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,059
way ahead of the rest of the ITF like on

463
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,799
the other thing

464
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,900
yes Richard

465
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,700
there's nothing wrong with being in the

466
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,400
lead you're of I'm just going to do a

467
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,080
little Cherry from the floor and suggest

468
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,640
that like this seems like something

469
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,480
where the broad outlines are clear

470
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,160
um you know the use cases clear the

471
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,679
approach is clear there is a nuances to

472
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:29,940
be worked at in terms of some of the

473
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,320
coordination stuff it's been mentioned

474
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,600
but I think this is more than ready for

475
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,039
an adoption call so I'd encourage to

476
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,000
just go ahead and call for that

477
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,039
um I would love it to review but based

478
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,660
on my initial review this looks good to

479
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,160
start at

480
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,400
yes so uh Carl

481
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,919
I just wanted to address Deb's Point

482
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,480
um about there are lots of different

483
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,240
types that's that's intended this this

484
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,520
draft is basically an abstraction layer

485
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,380
for stuff that exists in the wild

486
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,240
because we're not going to have a draft

487
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,539
per thing that exists so the web authent

488
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,580
gives us a means to say that we're

489
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,919
supporting an apple attestation or

490
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
Google at a station or a ubico at a

491
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,820
station or what have you through that

492
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,280
format where we diverge and I haven't

493
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,900
read the draft yet but just from talking

494
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,240
with the authors of the TLs

495
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,460
they've added another abstraction layer

496
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,440
due to a use case as mentioned a moment

497
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,320
ago so that web often is still there but

498
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,539
it's just bumped down one level so it's

499
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:37,220
it's maybe sub-ideal but it's still

500
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,900
one layer of this direction away from

501
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,179
what you have here right yeah okay and

502
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,919
then the mechanism in this draft and the

503
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,380
draft and lamps are the same lots of

504
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,640
plagiarism

505
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,780
okay

506
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,980
okay from me I should say

507
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,679
so why don't we go to the list and ask

508
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
for adoption then

509
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,299
I think that's fair right

510
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,020
so anyone opposed to asking for adoption

511
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,360
I guess not okay

512
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,500
oh do you pardon

513
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,100
I didn't hear you can you say that again

514
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,100
oh sorry I asked if anybody in the room

515
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,100
uh orange the lip has uh opposed to

516
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,860
asking for adoption

517
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:25,260
and I got silence so I guess nobody is

518
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,220
I thought we didn't call people out

519
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,100
and we'll uh

520
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,080
we'll see what happens we do need more

521
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,659
review though I think correct yes okay

522
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,480
awesome thank you

523
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,500
don't take the quicker with

524
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
you

525
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,840
no I know yeah I mean it's useless right

526
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,080
so

527
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,820
okay

528
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,780
let's

529
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,880
hello hello

530
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,679
thank you uh great things from

531
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,159
Switzerland uh I'd like to present a new

532
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
proposal uh here at DNS account one

533
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,860
uh so uh next slide please

534
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,260
uh we already know dns01 it is an

535
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,600
existing Challenge and it is specified

536
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,280
in RFC 8555 uh next slide please

537
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,640
uh basically it works with storing a

538
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,799
random value in a txt record under

539
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,200
underscore ahmeda's challenge

540
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,440
uh next slide please

541
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,480
however some people just have a DNS

542
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,460
server that cannot easily be automated

543
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,460
maybe it reads A Zone file from disk

544
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,640
doesn't play well with Acme clients so a

545
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,440
frequent setup is to have a SIM name

546
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,980
record to a DNS server that supports an

547
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,320
API or a database on the back end or

548
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,120
something like that so so this setup

549
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,720
exists uh and it has a few problems next

550
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,100
slide please

551
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,679
uh one of the use cases we've heard

552
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,960
about is a multi-region deployments

553
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,740
where a service exists in a deployment

554
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,539
where there are multiple regions that

555
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,460
are independent from each other

556
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,559
so the operators do not want any

557
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,860
dependencies basically all but one

558
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,140
regions can go down in the service would

559
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,900
still be able to function next slide

560
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,100
please

561
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,620
another scenario we've seen is zero

562
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,900
downtime migrations maybe someone is

563
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,880
moving from a cloud provider for example

564
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,400
to an on-premises setup and this

565
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,600
migration can take months like multiple

566
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,280
multiples of the lifetime of short-lit

567
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,919
certificates so they need to be able to

568
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,840
issue certificate from both the old

569
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,200
setup and the new one uh in order to

570
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
ensure that

571
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,880
the service continues to work uh next

572
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,380
slide please

573
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,320
uh and in all of these scenarios uh like

574
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,059
people don't want to have to run every

575
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,400
UH 60 days they don't want to have to go

576
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,760
and run search Bots there and SCP the

577
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,960
private Keys around and do any of these

578
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,820
things and they also don't want to have

579
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,440
any downtime like when they do the

580
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,179
migration they want the search to be

581
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,100
already there they don't want to change

582
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,799
the records and then just hope that like

583
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,260
for a few minutes until the TLs sets can

584
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,679
be issued traffic will be dropped and in

585
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,419
general some of them either for

586
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,700
compliance reasons or operational

587
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,279
reasons they try reliability they try to

588
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,559
have no dependencies between those

589
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,840
regions

590
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,720
um so next slide please uh the problem

591
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,480
here is that if you have a cnname record

592
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,700
it has to point to somewhere it has to

593
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,659
point to a DNS server uh next slide uh

594
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,120
but you cannot have two c Name Records

595
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
due to how DNS works you you just can't

596
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,559
have two senior records of points to the

597
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,720
old and the new setup all to five

598
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,779
synonyms one per region

599
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,640
um next slide please

600
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,659
so that's why we're proposing to address

601
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,100
these regions and a few others were

602
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,620
proposing DNS account or one we don't

603
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,260
intend to replace the ns01 with this

604
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,940
this is just an additional challenge

605
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,500
that we want to introduce next slide

606
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,320
um this is uh what the label looks like

607
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,659
instead of just underscore Acme does

608
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,179
challenge it also has an ID

609
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,960
and next slide here you can see the

610
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,000
first point which is this this

611
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,640
unresolved let's say comment and it is

612
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,500
the use of the underscore there why is

613
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,840
it not a dash

614
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,480
um the standard works there there are no

615
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,279
problems even if it becomes a dust the

616
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,440
reason we did that was basically so the

617
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,720
fields can be separated because Acme and

618
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,000
challenge are technically the same field

619
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,460
so we wanted to separate it visually

620
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,159
better but there is no technical concern

621
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,200
there like we're happy to change it if

622
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,320
you want uh next slide please

623
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,039
so about this ID here

624
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,100
um uh what is it how is it generated in

625
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,299
the next slide you can say that we've

626
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:14,220
basically take the Acme account resource

627
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,120
URL

628
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,159
uh this is defined in the RFC 8555

629
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,140
and we calculate the hash of it we take

630
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,500
the first 10 bytes and then we base 32

631
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,140
this this entire thing and the reason we

632
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,340
chose the account URL is because every

633
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,740
region or every service you use has a

634
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,500
different Acme account so it works

635
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,600
fairly well to separate between them if

636
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,120
we did it pair CA it may not have been

637
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,000
flexible and it also survives account

638
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,279
Acme account key rollovers so you can

639
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,419
replace the keys and you still have the

640
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,539
same ID there and the reason we pick 10

641
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,779
bytes is so it's we needed something

642
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,520
that does not have a lot of collisions

643
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,640
it's not long enough to to create

644
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,620
problems with uh DNS and it's also

645
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,200
exactly at the Block size for base 32 so

646
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,880
it doesn't have any padding in the end

647
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,539
like the equal signs next slide please

648
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,000
uh here you can see another comment we

649
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,340
received like how do we denote the first

650
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,380
10 bytes because in some programming

651
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,000
languages like the last digit is

652
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,520
excluded uh we just opted for the

653
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,500
mathematical notation and we also Define

654
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,299
it in the text that this means the first

655
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,919
time bytes

656
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,159
uh next slide please so here every

657
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,279
region or every use case uh it can it

658
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,100
has a basically a different Acme uh a

659
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,679
different DNS label so you can create as

660
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,779
many of them as you want and you can see

661
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,760
name each one individually and have them

662
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,039
point to your uh automatable DNS server

663
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,039
uh next slide please

664
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:00,360
um also akumi is not about only a webpki

665
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,140
and publicly trusted cas

666
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,840
uh so uh we wanted to check make sure

667
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,320
that it works well for this use case uh

668
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,320
and uh we looked at the next slide we

669
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,240
looked at the cab Forum Baseline

670
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,720
requirements section 32247 it allows

671
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,380
issuance so any publicly trusted CA can

672
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,100
use it today if they want to we don't

673
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,500
have to go through any ballots we don't

674
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,200
have to get any approvals it can start

675
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
working today

676
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,659
um and uh basically that's the

677
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,159
presentation in the next slide you can

678
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,580
see some resources uh like the the draft

679
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,360
and the URL of the data tracker and the

680
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,159
rest of the time about two-thirds of it

681
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,440
I think we have for questions or

682
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,840
comments

683
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,020
foreign

684
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,320
so Richard's making comments in the chat

685
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,580
I don't know whether he wants to come to

686
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,120
the mic or not

687
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,940
yeah they're all about the zero to nine

688
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,340
notation

689
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,919
yeah super minor stuff that there's like

690
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,840
every answer to that is wrong um and

691
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,700
it's just you know

692
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,559
the question of having the text to

693
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,659
clarify so that's not a big deal

694
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,880
um I seem to recall we had a bunch of

695
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
discussion on the list about various

696
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,899
options here and this is the one that

697
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,880
seems to meet all of the requirements so

698
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,580
this this seems like reasonably put

699
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,140
together I would be ready for an

700
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,980
adoption call on this

701
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,039
thank you

702
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,440
so the question is going to be how many

703
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,460
people have read the draft

704
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,439
and

705
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,340
coupled

706
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,820
couple

707
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,399
not so what oh yeah I'd like a few

708
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:08,479
worked examples

709
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,460
we do need to um

710
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,140
we do need to get a little bit more

711
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,360
review on the list I think and then

712
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,200
we'll

713
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,080
um be happy to ask for adoption I think

714
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,140
yeah

715
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,380
uh if can I add a few uh notes as well

716
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,100
since we have some time we've posted uh

717
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,940
something on on mdsp for Mozilla to try

718
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,919
to get to see if there are any problems

719
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:36,779
with that and they were happy with the

720
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,240
solution and we have a working

721
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,820
implementation in a testing environment

722
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,899
for over two years now and in production

723
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:48,000
uh limited so not available to to many

724
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,279
people for a few months now so there is

725
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,720
also implementation of this

726
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,100
Baseline requirements constrain what

727
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,080
validation Excellence are acceptable in

728
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,399
the webpki

729
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,440
um is that going to require some

730
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,080
adjustment to accommodate this uh this

731
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,760
mechanism

732
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,399
um now it will not in the previous slide

733
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,760
uh you can see the section basically any

734
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,039
value that any DNS label that starts

735
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,500
with an underscore and it is immediately

736
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,200
uh after the domain that you want to

737
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,980
validate works and dns01 is the only

738
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,080
challenge that works for wildcard

739
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,260
certificates as well which is one of the

740
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,380
main issues people had with uh with the

741
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,880
other challenges so so it shouldn't

742
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
require anything from the cab forum and

743
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,320
it can be used today

744
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,380
yeah uh Tim hellaby for digital

745
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,720
apologies for not using the automated

746
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,620
thing

747
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,059
um I think you might actually have a few

748
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,500
cab form problems that you haven't

749
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,179
anticipated

750
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,679
um and in particular because it looks

751
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,419
like I just reviewed this really quickly

752
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,520
but it looks like the uh

753
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,740
the validation method that's for Acme

754
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,380
basically says use 855 and 8555 says at

755
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,000
the Acme Challenge and doesn't have

756
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,620
support for this additional stuff that

757
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,320
you're adding so I think that you would

758
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,940
have to update the validation methods to

759
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,360
allow this

760
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,980
um okay we will have to to have a look

761
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,740
at this one uh we this is the first time

762
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,419
we received this feedback and we can

763
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,519
check again uh thank you for the comment

764
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,740
yeah uh more than happy to discuss this

765
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,120
with you on the list and help you figure

766
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,820
it out of course yes thank you very much

767
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,640
to be sure to cabf have a

768
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,740
pretty good streamlined processing

769
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,440
something needs to go through a ballot

770
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,380
it's it's fine

771
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,480
yeah the ITF is slower

772
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,399
yeah if it's something that that needs

773
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,200
to be done we're happy to do it as well

774
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,480
of course we just didn't think from our

775
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,640
interpretation that there were any

776
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,279
uh requirements but we'll we'll discuss

777
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,140
this later

778
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,559
sure

779
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,699
so

780
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,300
seeing as nobody else is on the Queue

781
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,679
that's the same question I asked last

782
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,000
time

783
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,580
um is anyone opposed to

784
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,679
um doing an induction column this

785
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,820
because the feedback I got in the zulip

786
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,560
room is pretty positive

787
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,159
but yeah seems fine and sane uh kind of

788
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,240
gets repeated

789
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,639
so I see no objections at least foreign

790
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,199
okay I think we can do that then

791
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,719
thank you

792
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,899
thank you

793
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,460
and

794
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,160
with that out of the way all we're left

795
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,740
is this is

796
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,500
the slide do we have any other business

797
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,560
not all at once okay

798
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,859
seems like we're done here and we can

799
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,640
all right have some cookies in real life

800
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,160
right yeah and we can have cookies until

801
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,140
six dispatch

802
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,540
right

803
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,660
more time to get across the hotel

804
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,300
okay all right thank you very much

805
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,119
thank you

806
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,160
maybe I'll really be in the in the

807
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,240
actual room next time

808
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:45,720
you better be

809
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,099
[Music]

810
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:49,320
I haven't been in an Acme meeting in

811
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,680
three years

812
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,140
okay

813
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,579
it's okay we'll see you later

814
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,839
right

815
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,960
you know but he wasn't in the room

816
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,200
yeah I was in the hotel room it's sort

817
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
of he was in the hotel but he wasn't in

818
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
the room

819
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,400
it's okay

820
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,320
[Laughter]

821
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,460
that was not meant to be mean

822
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,079
thanks for the notes girl

823
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,379
