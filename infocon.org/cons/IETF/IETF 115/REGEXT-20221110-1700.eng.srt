1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,279
foreign

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,079
okay I I have the top of the hour here

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,539
I don't know about anybody else

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,119
um let me do a quick check first for a

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,340
note taker as we've done in the past um

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,740
pretty straightforward for us the

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,140
agenda's already in the notepad thing we

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,300
just need some help from one or more

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,920
people to just put some actions in there

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,660
so we got at least one hand out there

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,480
from Wicklow home but please anybody uh

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,820
even remote participants you know just

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,340
track in there and uh as we pass through

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,980
things just capture uh whatever actions

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,600
came out of it

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,700
um I think uh in today's world given

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,200
that we do recordings and you have the

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,059
agenda there I don't know that we have

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,579
to have detailed summary minutes

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,020
um at least not for us and our

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,480
discussions as a rule but capturing the

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,460
actions and any results is is kind of

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,039
important so a quick bullet about those

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,500
things would be helpful

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,760
all right

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,040
so let's um get started

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,540
I am Jim Galvin we have Antoine Boucher

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,560
in here

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,820
um it's been a long time so if you had

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,840
the two of us sitting at the table

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,360
together so uh you know yay for the

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,580
working group I suppose or not depending

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,500
on how you feel about things

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,600
um but uh yeah registration protocols

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,560
extensions we have an hour today and uh

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,200
a very full agenda or perhaps we'll end

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,759
a little early because I think one of

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,520
the discussions we gave a lot of time to

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
um actually is gonna might work out

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,759
pretty well

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,700
so let's uh jump in here by now this is

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Thursday night last session of the week

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,380
of uh Thursday the full days uh you all

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,759
know the note well you've seen it many

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,520
times before uh please remember you know

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,680
your contributions are are public and

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,759
and part of uh the ITF uh as we uh go

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,799
through this and of course our code of

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,420
conduct always a good reminder to people

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,720
to please be respectful and focus on the

51
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,759
substance and the issues and and not

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,899
each other

53
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,300
um that's always a good reminder for us

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
and so uh and of course in these covet

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,360
times masks are required unless you are

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,480
actually standing at the mic uh and or

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,580
actively eating or drinking

58
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,220
um so please uh do uh remember to uh

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,500
keep your mask on

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,440
okay this is our agenda for today a

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,840
quick opportunity for anyone to offer up

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,640
any agenda bashing

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
um it's pretty pro forma

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,120
um this is our standard agenda that we

65
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
do here and the last three items are

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,319
just uh some presentations that we

67
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,760
called out because they got some time

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
allotment but the other uh first half of

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,160
this are just our standard gen items

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,379
we'll just walk through things quickly

71
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,120
and not seeing any hands so I'm just

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
going to keep right on going here and

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
into our welcome and introductions and

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
uh we've already done the note well and

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,640
the note scribe so just some quick notes

76
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,160
about document management and uh Antoine

77
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,120
you were going to say some few words

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
about this

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,260
yes so this is the part where we usually

80
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,540
uh say how we are doing our work in this

81
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,580
working group and as you know we have

82
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,819
we've for some time now ask for document

83
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,340
Shepherds when we adopt a document in

84
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,739
this in this working group

85
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,019
um and that works actually quite well

86
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,180
we're very pleased with that

87
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,739
um especially because we always imagine

88
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,700
that not to be too much work and it also

89
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,220
gives the opportunity for newcomers in

90
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,120
the uh in in the ITF to understand the

91
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,319
process

92
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,480
um but for this time I've I've put up

93
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,099
the process of how a document is

94
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,680
published a little bit because what we

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
saw well over the over the past not

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,640
recent time but but for a longer time uh

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
that

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,940
um when we adopt a working group graph

99
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,220
and that's a formal process then we have

100
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,200
iterations of the document and then a

101
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,819
document moves into working group last

102
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,379
call

103
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,840
um and the intention is that a document

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,340
that moves into working Google Plus call

105
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,519
is a stable document because we are a

106
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,900
small working group we also notice that

107
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,360
sometimes the document didn't get very

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,180
very many reactions during the

109
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,620
discussion in the working group so a

110
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,940
document is moved into working group

111
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,940
class called quite quite I wouldn't say

112
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,800
fast but we don't have too much uh

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,680
stringent

114
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,900
rules about it

115
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,580
but something that is very important is

116
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,360
that

117
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,060
when we want to have the process for a

118
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,040
document Shepherd to be tracking changes

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,800
during working group last call

120
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,160
um we want that process to be easy so

121
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,440
we've seen recently that during working

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,419
Global school people start reviewing the

123
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,460
document and the number of iterations

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,580
take place so that there are multiple

125
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,259
documents that the document sheper needs

126
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,720
to review during working on Glasgow

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
because Alters publish a new version of

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,419
the of a document during working group

129
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,419
let's call it the minute that they

130
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,520
um agree that there is still an issue

131
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,139
with the document

132
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,540
um I would ask people not to do that to

133
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,320
make documents stable uh we as chairs

134
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,479
have decided that we're going to call

135
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,460
outs working Google Plus call for a

136
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,460
specific document and number and there

137
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,320
are a number of tools that authors can

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,419
use during working group last call to

139
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,000
track issues

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,699
um we that some people use GitHub there

141
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,680
is an issue tracker you can use a Wiki

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,199
page but please publish a new version of

143
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,180
the document after working group law

144
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,520
school changes because that will give

145
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,800
the opportunity to you know in

146
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,900
experience audience document Shepherds

147
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,539
to track the changes and and make sure

148
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,960
that the program the the the the process

149
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,000
um works out uh quite well so that's

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,460
just a request from us you know be sure

151
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,919
that when you uh ask for a working group

152
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,560
last call uh that the document is stable

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,199
and try not to publish a new version of

154
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,780
the document until all your issues are

155
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,180
clear during the working group last call

156
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,060
and and that's basically my question

157
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,280
[Music]

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
okay any questions or comments

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
not seeing any hands or things in the

160
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,020
chat room so let's move along here uh

161
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,060
let's move to published documents um

162
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,520
sadly none this time we had a few that

163
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,900
we mentioned last time but that's

164
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,340
because we were catching up on quite

165
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,319
some distance but I think we're gonna

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,940
we're gonna move along a few documents

167
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,000
for next time so moving right along uh

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,680
we do have

169
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,199
um documents in uh

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,380
uh working group last call

171
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,259
um actually uh so the reverse search and

172
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,860
uh the uh Federated uh open ID

173
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,240
um to spend a little bit of discussion

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,660
on the mailing list so uh we'll uh you

175
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,000
know deal with those on on the list and

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,940
um I think the Federated uh eye open ID

177
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,860
is probably going to come back to the

178
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,539
working group last call there was a side

179
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,020
meeting uh yesterday day before

180
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,240
um where a few people got together and

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
uh raised kind of a an important

182
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,880
technical question uh which

183
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,120
um I believe is is well is material

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,319
enough that it's going to suggest

185
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
bringing the document back to the

186
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,860
working group to take a look at those

187
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,080
changes before we press this thing

188
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
forward so just look out for that on the

189
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
mailing list so that we can you know

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,000
formally do what we need to do there

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,039
um and I believe the reverse search is

192
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,639
is headed to closure right so so that

193
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,780
was one of the documents where there

194
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,280
were multiple versions of the document

195
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,860
and you know the the another issue that

196
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,960
it brings but it's just more for us as

197
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,660
chairs is that it's it becomes very hard

198
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,500
to

199
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,340
claim consensus uh until after a

200
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,020
document Shepard has told us that all

201
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,060
the issues were resolved so we're still

202
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,919
waiting for that uh there was still one

203
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
issue that had to be uh called out on

204
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,360
the mailing list uh and that was a week

205
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,819
before uh before the meeting and so

206
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,500
apologies that we didn't react to that

207
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,900
immediately but um after the meet after

208
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,300
this meeting we will uh we will close it

209
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,360
and and move forward with that

210
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,000
okay I'm going to keep plowing through

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,220
here and thus somebody wants to jump up

212
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,979
and get in the queue here to speak uh

213
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,599
moving right along we'll get to status

214
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,479
of existing work and uh chairs here are

215
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
just going to ZIP down through these uh

216
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
the simple registration reporting uh and

217
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
the uh JS contact and the redacted

218
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,979
Fields documents are all imminently

219
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,979
ready for working group last call now we

220
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,839
we have established for ourselves a bit

221
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,580
of a process where we only do documents

222
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,120
one at a time in last call we did do a

223
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,680
little bit of overlap on those other two

224
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,300
which is why there's two out there at

225
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,240
once we had expected the one to close

226
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,060
and so we opened up the second one and

227
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,040
then there was a bit of delay in all of

228
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,060
that

229
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,800
um but on for the benefit of our group

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,140
we just are recognizing we don't have

231
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,839
that many active people here and so even

232
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,899
though these documents all have been uh

233
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,339
suggested that they're ready to go to

234
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,380
the last call we're just going to issue

235
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,480
them one at a time here serially

236
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,220
so that we don't burden everybody with

237
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,440
having to read them all all at once and

238
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,600
given these other two that have a couple

239
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,300
of uh I think they they might turn out

240
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,580
to be straightforward changes so we

241
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,959
might wait to issue the next working

242
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,480
group last call till those come back we

243
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,459
see what we're going to do with them and

244
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:36,779
if we can get them right back into

245
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,120
working group last call to move along I

246
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
think we'll do that

247
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,180
um unless anybody would like to do

248
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,860
something different I mean this is just

249
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,600
the process we've been following and

250
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,820
we're telling you so if anybody wants to

251
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,880
uh jump one of these first three in the

252
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,580
uh queue here in terms of when they go

253
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,519
to last call uh you know please do feel

254
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,380
free to let us know say something on the

255
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,300
mailing list really

256
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,380
um

257
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,560
and uh

258
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,779

261
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,480
registration reporting

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,580
um you're right uh I may not have

263
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,620

264
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,920
um but uh I know that um uh Antoine and

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,480
I have talked about it but let's go to

266
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,519
the queue here on a couple of things uh

267
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,800
before I talk about data

268
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,779
dictionary so Jim go ahead please Jim

269
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,140
Gould

270
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,120
can you hear me

271
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,660
yes we can go ahead good good yeah uh

272
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,120
there are some open items with the super

273
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,700
registration recording draft

274
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,240
um that were discussed on the list I

275
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
mean specifically around splitting the

276
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,760
draft I had the framework uh defined in

277
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,519
a separate standards track graph and

278
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,820
then have the actual concrete reports uh

279
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,519
in a informational draft that was what

280
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,600
was discussed

281
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,240
thank you okay thank you for that uh

282
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,640
I'll make sure to uh go back and and

283
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,220
check that so uh we'll take care of that

284
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,339
thank you uh Rick Wilhelm next

285
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,459
thanks Jim um Rick Wilhelm PIR uh this

286
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,880
is really a a quick comment related to

287
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,579
the redacted fields and rdap responses

288
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,680
as Jim knows because he's involved with

289
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,240
me in another front

290
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,760
um that's one that over in land of of

291
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,000
icann there's some policy work that is

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
right now leaning on the

293
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,140
um on the ID and so it would be it would

294
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,540
be good if that could turn into an RFC

295
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,019
so from the technical community that

296
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,899
that becomes stable more quickly rather

297
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,959
than later uh so that would so as we

298
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,339
look to see which one of these is going

299
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,380
to kind of line up next there's a an

300
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,120
auxiliary benefit of moving that one

301
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,800
ahead but that's something you're aware

302
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,240
of Jim but just for the broader group

303
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,680
thank you

304
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,600
so thank you for that

305
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,279
um yes I'm glad that you brought that up

306
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,420
so

307
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,640
um you know that that's just sort of a

308
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,600
suggestion to the uh chairs that um

309
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
we I'm taking that as a suggestion to

310
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
the chairs that we try to move that one

311
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,380
along uh ahead of anything else as

312
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,180
quickly as we can choose that for the

313
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,380
next one to go to working group last

314
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,680
call so let me ask on behalf of Antoine

315
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,779
and I if anyone um has a different point

316
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,959
of view about that uh to please um let

317
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,240
us know uh say something on the list or

318
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,420
uh come here and speak up and uh Jim

319
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,880
Gould I see you in the Q next please go

320
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,060
ahead

321
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,100
yeah and relate can you hear me

322
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,160
yes go ahead please yeah in relation to

323
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,940
the uh regret redacted uh draft uh there

324
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,279
is that uh normative reference

325
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,639
dependency to the Json path base

326
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,360
draft uh we reached out to the editors

327
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,940
for that draft and the Milestone set for

328
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,820
this month uh and they confirmed that

329
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,060
that was accurate uh we have provided

330
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,459
review feedback to that draft to

331
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,279
hopefully move it along uh really the

332
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,040
work is done with the redacted draft so

333
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,680
I guess the question for the chairs is

334
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,600
whether or not we can go to working in

335
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,139
class call in parallel with this uh

336
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,440
normative dependency

337
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,300
so I just want to put that question out

338
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,980
there

339
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,040
yeah so the answer to that should be yes

340
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,500
unless we are expecting something

341
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,420
material to happen in the other

342
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,060
normative reference that would impact

343
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,800
our document then we might want to be

344
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,139
concerned but as I understand it the

345
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,760
other normative reference is fairly

346
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,560
stable the JS contact has a similar

347
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,440
down reference at the moment but um you

348
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,779
know we can submit these to the isg for

349
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,180
publication and they will then get their

350
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,660
review and then they'll be tagged for to

351
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,579
be held while we wait for the other

352
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,920
document to catch up since it can't be

353
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,500
published with a normative uh you know

354
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,940
down reference

355
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,760
so we should be okay moving that forward

356
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,720
[Music]

357
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,180
okay good I uh good so we'll go ahead

358
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,180
and put a request on the list is that uh

359
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,220
The Next Step then

360
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,680
yes please please do do that that would

361
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,000
be perfect

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,779
great thank you

363
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
okay uh Mark every hand uh go ahead

364
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,060
please

365
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,519
um

366
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,120
to me redacted and just contacts should

367
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,980
be the most

368
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,079
the highest priorities

369
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,839
especially because she has contact

370
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,420
you know it would be a long process to

371
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,380
get all the implementation you know and

372
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,100
then get rid of G cards so

373
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,220
the more we wait so

374
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,980
redacted and GS contact in my book would

375
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,980
be that the most prior

376
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,339
okay thank you appreciate that

377
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,620
um and uh as I said before anyone else

378
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,000
who wants to make a comment about

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,519
priority order of these documents uh

380
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,880
please do let us know and and speak up

381
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,519
okay uh the registration data dictionary

382
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,740
uh is is just there they haven't

383
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,779
requested last call

384
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,279
um I understand from talking to the

385
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,560
authors that they're getting ready to uh

386
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,540
they consider themselves

387
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,519
um almost ready like really close to

388
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,740
asking for our uh working group last

389
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,839
call so I just want to put that on your

390
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,880
radar to be watching for that and

391
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,560
that'll just end up being on our list

392
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,300
here and we'll move through the

393
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,360
documents uh one at a time as we said

394
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
unless anybody wants to suggest

395
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,180
something different

396
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,220
okay

397
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,199
uh not seeing it oh do you want to speak

398
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,540
go ahead yeah just for my sense of the

399
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,079
room who has read or contributed to the

400
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,279
data dictionary document

401
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,138
okay read the document please

402
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,160
and for the remote participants we had

403
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,800
two people in the room raise their hand

404
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,660
um and we've got a room of about 20

405
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,820
people here not quite

406
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,000
um so uh go ahead Rick so uh Rick will

407
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
help here I've I've read it and

408
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,959
commented extensively about how much I

409
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,540
don't like it so I'm not sure if that

410
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,680
qualifies Antoine

411
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,899
I want to get some sense of how many

412
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,040
people are actually you know

413
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,540
participating in the process

414
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,060
so yes good to know thank you

415
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,759
um we do have a an unfortunate reality

416
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,120
in our group of uh silences no objection

417
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,759
and tends to be supportive so it's good

418
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,100
it's especially important

419
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,079
um you know if you have concerns

420
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,420
questions issues to make sure those get

421
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,400
on the list so that we can take that

422
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,199
into account

423
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,900
um so uh please uh please do make sure

424
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,459
to do that

425
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,959
okay

426
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,720
um with that we will jump into a bit of

427
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,699
substantive work that we have here we

428
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,740
are about 10 minutes behind schedule at

429
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,059
the moment but we're hoping we can make

430
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,040
some of that up and with that let me

431
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,619
turn this over to everyone

432
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,100
yes and uh so the next our next topic is

433
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,720
going to be about a document that had

434
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,360
quite some discussion during the IDF

435
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,799
working group plans to order for the

436
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,559
ietf last call

437
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,380
um and uh a lot of work and a lot of

438
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,820
discussion has been taking place there

439
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,960
and

440
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,500
um some of the work may be material and

441
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,780
that's why we want to well bring it up

442
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,000
here for uh for discussion I want to

443
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,880
give some uh some people not usually in

444
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,220
this working group some some time to

445
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,260
discuss this document with us it's the

446
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,299
international use of internationalized

447
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,539
email addresses document and James Gould

448
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,539
has made some slides on the

449
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,919
um the results of the the ITF right last

450
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,799
call so uh Jim do you want to

451
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,500
do your slides and talk about what the

452
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,000
results were or what you think the

453
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,520
results were yeah there is oh yes can

454
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,559
you hear me all right

455
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,840
yeah okay good thank you very much for

456
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,419
being true on this yeah um there was uh

457
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,160
plenty of discussion at the ITF Last

458
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,460
Call on this draft and uh really there's

459
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,280
one remaining open item that uh we

460
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,020
really want to discuss here with the

461
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,460
working group you can go ahead and click

462
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,400
the next slide please

463
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,440
so a little bit of background uh the

464
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,620
draft version 10 entered ietf Last Call

465
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,280
on May 27th lots of discussion lots of

466
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,360
feedback

467
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,460
um and we made updates based on that

468
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,919
feedback specifically we removed the

469
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,620
definition of a functional extension and

470
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,900
changed the graph to be a command

471
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,360
response extension the last version is

472
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,240
uh version 16. so the one remaining

473
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,760
issue is associated with the email

474
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,760
cardinality and I cover on the next

475
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,220
slide examples of the cardinality

476
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,340
um

477
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,200
actually go back to the prior slide I'm

478
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,080
sorry I'm sorry I want to get the

479
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,480
specific feedback so the specific

480
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,360
feedback was if a non-ascii email

481
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,400
address is to be supportive there should

482
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,620
be provision for an all ASCII

483
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,200
alternative to be provided so having an

484
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,900
alternative email changes the

485
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,880
cardinality of the number of email

486
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,120
addresses that are passed but the end

487
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,240
goal here is that we want to be able to

488
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,200
support the SMTP TFA addresses and EBP

489
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,700
and existing extensions and going

490
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,960
forward so you can go to next slide

491
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,460
so here is a list of Epp specifications

492
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,179
um that have email addresses in them now

493
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,160
there are more I'm sure but these are

494
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,220
the ones that I were aware of so the

495
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,260
contact mapping has a single required

496
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,200
email uh the mark and side Mark mapping

497
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,120
is not an extension but it's used by

498
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,240
extensions it actually has a required

499
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,480
holder issuer email and a optional

500
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
contact email this provides a little bit

501
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,640
of complexity associated with creating

502
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
an extension

503
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,100
of that particular spec because you

504
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,840
can't really identify which email is

505
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,820
being extended but good news here is

506
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,700
that's not an Epp extension uh the

507
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,140
organization mapping the validate

508
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,660
mapping have a single optional element

509
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,860
and then the last two are proprietary uh

510
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,820
extensions uh that have a single uh

511
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,240
required on it so in summary on this we

512
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,640
have a mix of extensions that have

513
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,380
either zero or one emails or one uh

514
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,059
email so go to next slide please

515
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,000
so there are three approaches uh the

516
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
first is the status quo which is the to

517
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,160
keep with the cardinality in one or at

518
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
most one

519
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,059
um and leave it up to the server policy

520
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,600
related to allowing for the use of SMTP

521
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,660
utf-8 addresses in place of the ASCII

522
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,120
addresses this is what's currently in

523
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,159
the draft right now

524
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,080
um and then this next option is to

525
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,520
change the cardinality to a one or two

526
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,440
this means that there would be support

527
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,860
for an alternate email element

528
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,140
um but that would require one email

529
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,440
element to be provided when an alternate

530
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,500
is used uh the alternate email element

531
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,840
would be used during a transition period

532
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,640
which would be defined by server

533
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,220
policies so it's not predefined in the

534
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,559
draft it would be up to a the server to

535
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,840
determine when it's the right time to uh

536
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,659
to require the use of an alternate email

537
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,020
uh and then finally the the last one is

538
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,120
changing to a list

539
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,880
um and this would be where uh the

540
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
extension would provide for a list of

541
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,580
emails and there may be uh support for

542
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,760
types in that scenario go to the next

543
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,179
slide please

544
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,700
our recommendation is to go with the

545
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,900
second option

546
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,840
uh which is the change cardinality to a

547
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,340
one or two

548
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,220
uh in the draft to provide a guidance

549
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,980
related to the transition period this

550
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,780
would mean extending the create command

551
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,539
the update command and the info response

552
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,120
to support the use of an alternate email

553
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,580
element

554
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,380
this will provide the ability to set an

555
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,799
unset uh the alternate email as well as

556
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,780
getting an indication of whether or not

557
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,720
it's been set or it's not set

558
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,159
with this recommendation it would follow

559
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,480
the consensus of the working group

560
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,780
related to be able support uh either an

561
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,620
ASCII or SMTP utf-8

562
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,500
email value and I believe it will

563
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,620
address the ietf last call feedback

564
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,240
associated with being able to support

565
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,940
alternate email at least in this case

566
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,159
during a transition period

567
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,419
next slide please

568
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,760
there you go so in conclusion uh we're

569
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,740
looking for feedback from the working

570
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,500
group related to what is the best option

571
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,860
uh to move this draft forward

572
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,960
and then I'll just leave it open for a

573
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,799
discussion

574
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,159
okay thank you very much Jim

575
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,179
um

576
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,159
yeah I wanted to say John cleansing is

577
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,419
in the queue

578
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,039
um

579
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,220
so John go ahead and give your

580
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,100
answers to some questions

581
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,679
okay having been the one who raised this

582
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,419
set of issues

583
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,020
um

584
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,179
I think the recommendation is the

585
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,380
correct one

586
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,039
I think from a semantic standpoint

587
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,000
talking about this in terms of

588
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,280
cardinality is the wrong thing to do but

589
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,120
that may be just a vocabulary question

590
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,500
um

591
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,860
uh the key here is an operationally uh

592
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,080
SMTP utf-a addresses not asking

593
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,760
addresses are are not universally usable

594
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,820
they're much more usable in their own

595
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,799
context

596
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,100
um and and countries and languages but

597
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,720
if they there's any reasonable

598
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,059
possibility that they could need to be

599
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,880
accessible internationally their uh

600
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,640
there needs to be provisioned for a not

601
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,760
asking address whether that

602
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,220
provision is

603
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,700
sometimes always usually usually not

604
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,340
used as a policy matter probably beyond

605
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,919
the scope of the specification but there

606
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,539
needs to be a way to provide that

607
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,580
information at the point you start

608
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,740
talking about more than two addresses

609
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,039
uh you're talking about

610
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,200
a mailing list for the equivalent and

611
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
not about this

612
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,100
um why not ask the address and one

613
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,900
asking address

614
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,559
so I think the recommendation is correct

615
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,360
uh it may be that we need to tune the

616
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,220
text it describes it a little bit

617
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,440
further or not I just have not had time

618
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,679
since that draft was posted to do a

619
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,120
really careful review automatically

620
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
okay thank you John

621
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,600
um

622
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,640
I have a question though but I think

623
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,100
Dimitri was first in the queue

624
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,080
then I'll put myself in the queue so go

625
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,840
ahead Dimitri you first okay hello uh

626
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
yes

627
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,000
great so oh

628
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,580
I agree that uh as a temporary

629
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,520
specification uh providing a backup

630
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,220
ASCII address is the best proposal

631
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,600
solution

632
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,700
and I thought I totally agree with uh

633
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,820
John uh that uh

634
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,919
[Music]

635
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,360
address are not widely not used nowadays

636
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,380
but uh I want to say that uh ice

637
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,640
personalize his life contradiction

638
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
between uh

639
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,779
uh the movement to make SMTP 8 uh

640
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,159
addresses uh Universal accepted

641
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,620
in particular bacon where the Epp

642
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,200
protocol is completely relevant

643
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,020
and the idea to support

644
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,740
it with the backup asking only

645
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,100
email address because well it means that

646
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,659
uh

647
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:20,159
we don't consider uh SMTP UTF addresses

648
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,760
uh first class email addresses

649
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,460
it's it looks sort of wrong but of

650
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,779
course yes uh I agree

651
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,200
I totally agree that for now it's a

652
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,179
realistic fiction thank you

653
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,360
foreign

654
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,400
I'm just watching the chatter and jabber

655
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,100
about the difference between what we're

656
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,419
the way this working group seems to be

657
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,779
using the term EAA or was and SMTP utf-a

658
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,039
and Pete just made an interesting

659
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,380
summary which is one is an email

660
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,760
protocol and one is just an email

661
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,360
address and maybe that clears up some of

662
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,919
my confusion about it I don't know if

663
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,140
that's helpful here so he I was going to

664
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,340
get it done to say this at the mic then

665
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,779
he said it in the jabber so I'm not sure

666
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:13,919
I have anything new to say do you wanna

667
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,520
sure

668
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,100
okay

669
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,399
okay

670
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,659
so then we go to Victor in the queue go

671
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,760
ahead Victor

672
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,640
uh I also agree with the uh recommended

673
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,419
choice but with the additional comment

674
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,360
that I think the so-called transitional

675
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,419
period is basically forever

676
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:47,520
uh I don't think the alternate address

677
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
the need for alternate addresses is

678
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
likely to go away in my lifetime

679
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,320
Lifetime and in part because

680
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,340
uh uh different communities will have

681
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,860
different needs and you know if I want

682
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,260
to mail somebody in the script I can't

683
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,900
recognize I always pick the alternate

684
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,059
address because I know what I'm looking

685
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,299
at

686
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,580
okay thank you Victor

687
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,460
and next Pizza on the mic yeah this Pete

688
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,100
Resnick uh just to sort of explain what

689
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,860
I mentioned in the chat room I think

690
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,539
thinking about this in terms of

691
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,460
cardinality of email addresses that you

692
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,840
have multiple email addresses is the

693
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,700
wrong way to think about this what

694
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,799
you're saying is these servers these

695
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,580
Services support a second email protocol

696
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,179
SMTP utf-8 instead of SMTP and to

697
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,860
support that protocol you need a piece

698
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,899
of data which is the

699
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,100
the

700
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,740
eai address the non-ascii address the

701
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,500
thing that goes into SMTP utf-8

702
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,779
that is different than if you're just

703
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,760
supporting SMTP

704
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,500
and so what you're doing when you

705
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,179
communicate this extension to the other

706
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,940
side is you're saying I support the

707
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,080
sending over the SMTP utf-8 protocol

708
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,179
and so any messages I'm going to send

709
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,559
are going over that protocol and they're

710
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,000
going to use this other address or they

711
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,380
could use

712
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,100
the email address that's also valid but

713
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,840
I mean it's just a different way of

714
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,399
thinking about it either way I support

715
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,860
the idea that what you're doing is

716
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,960
you're adding another field this

717
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,240
International email address

718
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,500
and uh or this non-aski email address

719
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,559
and you use it in circumstances where

720
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,399
the extension is available

721
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,760
Jim

722
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:43,200
so thank you uh Jim Galvin no hats

723
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,659
I think

724
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,880
we probably need to at this point it

725
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,380
sounds like we we definitely have to

726
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,480
pull this back to the working group for

727
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,799
a bit more discussion on the mailing

728
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,559
list because now I have the following

729
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,840
questions that come up in my mind I like

730
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,340
the distinction that Pete is making and

731
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,720
I get it you know between protocol

732
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,760
versus email address

733
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,020
but

734
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,080
I'm worried that we there's a lot more

735
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,360
discussion that we have to have there's

736
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,919
a lot more text that we have to have in

737
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,440
our document to sort of play that out in

738
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
the right way

739
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
what we're after here

740
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,080
um

741
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,559
I'm concerned that uh someone will use

742
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,399
the uh utf-8 field to uh push up and and

743
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,860
ask the address and they'll stick that

744
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,320
in the in the non-ascii field which

745
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,960
would be valid because a naski address

746
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,659
is utf-8

747
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,640
um and the discussion that we're going

748
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,440
to have to explain in this technical

749
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,720
document so that policies on the other

750
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,940
side can do the right thing

751
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,539
is whether or not that is actually a

752
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:54,779
utf-8 address or if it is just a ASCII

753
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,500
address

754
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,480
we're going to lose that particular bit

755
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,559
of signal

756
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,480
right because what we're trying to do

757
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,460
here in the transition step is

758
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,580
distinguish between those email systems

759
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,279
that only support ASCII addresses versus

760
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,919
non-ascii and

761
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,360
um the policies have to be able to

762
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,440
support that

763
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,620
so that uh in the registration systems

764
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,360
right I can I can make the right choice

765
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,179
when I'm trying to send something

766
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,039
um I am I making this clear I I just

767
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,899
have this picture in my head so the

768
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,220
other thing that occurs to me is the

769
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,480
second thing that I think I'm hearing

770
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,059
anyway in all of this discussion is

771
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,820
concerned about which one is the

772
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,500
priority so which is the one that you

773
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,140
put in the optional extra element

774
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,360
so if I want to put an ASCII only

775
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,659
address in the optional extra element

776
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,880
because I like that model

777
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,340
uh so we could go with the original way

778
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,740
that this draft was written you're going

779
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,120
to signal

780
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,120
uh in the Epp transaction that you're

781
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,640
that you understand and can accept utf-8

782
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,279
addresses but there's nothing that

783
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,919
prevents a registrar from just sticking

784
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,260
a asking only address in that field

785
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,000
which would be fine

786
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,340
but what you really want is you need the

787
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,720
extra signal

788
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,120
that down the road when somebody

789
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,820
retrieves this address they know that

790
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,860
they can still use it in an ASCII only

791
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,080
email system

792
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,120
otherwise you don't want them to think

793
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,340
that they have to reject it because it's

794
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,860
a non it's in a non-ascii email address

795
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,480
element

796
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,880
so we always have to make that so

797
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,080
there's a lot of discussion to be had

798
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,220
there I think about how to really

799
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,260
represent this and how much we want to

800
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,140
say and and what the right order is

801
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,000
um

802
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,159
and how it has to be used I think that's

803
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,200
where I'm going with this so yeah in the

804
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,159
end I'm thinking that we're going to

805
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,960
have to take this back and and walk

806
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,760
through some more of these issues in the

807
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,240
uh uh Discussion Group

808
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,039
so thanks

809
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,600
okay thank you Jim

810
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,279
um I put myself off out of the queue

811
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,080
because I wanted to make some some final

812
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,779
questions but if there's any response to

813
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,240
to Jim's um

814
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,480
story then go ahead uh John your next if

815
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,500
you have a reaction on that

816
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,739
Kim I think this is really really small

817
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,960
though I agree with you that Denise come

818
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,719
back from work text if you think about

819
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,899
this as a

820
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:23,820
preferred not ASCII address and an ASCII

821
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,560
address fallback

822
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,359
which is the vocabulary I've been using

823
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,879
since this discussion started or you

824
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,500
think about this in Pete's language

825
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,960
about two different protocols

826
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,199
but with a preference for the not asking

827
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,418
address you wouldn't be specifying it

828
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,780
then talking about this gets rather easy

829
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,000
if you start talking about as a list of

830
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,179
addresses using cardinality language

831
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,440
then you have to start making

832
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,540
distinctions about which of the

833
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,339
addresses on that list are more

834
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,659
important than others in what

835
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,599
circumstances and it's just a list and

836
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,740
that's why I've been objecting to

837
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,080
cardinality language in the beginning

838
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,640
but it's really up to the working groups

839
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,200
whether from my point of view it's

840
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,640
really up the working group as to

841
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,960
whether you want to make this hard or

842
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,540
easy and what Pete is suggesting and

843
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,880
what I've been suggesting looks to me

844
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,160
like the easy version and the

845
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,380
cardinality discussion even if it's

846
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,339
limited to two uh one or two uh looks

847
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,500
like the hard way to do it because it

848
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,480
involves all the issues that you just

849
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,900
raised

850
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,099
yes

851
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,460
okay thank you

852
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,660
uh Pete you're up next

853
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,180
should have gotten an earlier start this

854
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,380
is Pete

855
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,079
um so I just said in the chat room what

856
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,380
I think you should say protocol wise is

857
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,460
that

858
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,800
if you implement

859
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,560
SMTP utf-8 the the if you implement this

860
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,640
extension then you always use what's in

861
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,599
the

862
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,260
field

863
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,560
right you always use that address

864
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,540
sometimes that address might be

865
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,540
identical to that other field which is

866
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,660
the ASCII email address they could be in

867
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,119
exactly identical but you always use the

868
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,040
one if you're going to use the SMTP

869
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,040
utf-8 extension that's in the

870
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,460
internationalized email address field

871
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,380
if you're using the at if you're using

872
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,660
plain SMTP you're not implementing the

873
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,240
extension or the other side hasn't

874
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,520
implemented the extension then you fail

875
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,160
back then you use the ASCII email

876
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,240
address

877
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,200
does that make sense

878
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,480
and the ASCII one must always be said

879
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,579
because you might have to fail back to

880
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,160
the old and you know it would go so

881
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,839
you're saying you you always get both of

882
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:58,200
them back yeah both if you implement the

883
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,260
new stuff you've got two fields and they

884
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,240
most both must be filled in don't care

885
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,680
with what

886
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,480
um the one that's the internationalized

887
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,220
one might have

888
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,400
um non-ascii characters but it might be

889
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,560
entirely ASCII characters if you only

890
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,240
implement the old stuff then you'll have

891
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,940
one field and it will be the ask email

892
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,920
address either way you've got to have

893
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,960
all the fields filled in appropriately

894
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,880
okay next one Dimitri

895
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,540
thank you uh I won't just comment about

896
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,380
the context of the contactability I

897
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,740
agree that uh the email address is used

898
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,540
for the contact

899
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:48,960
but also we have a quite limited uh

900
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,740
set of situation when um

901
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,599
this address is can be used by a

902
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,119
non-capable

903
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,220
uh beer

904
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,020
as as uh we we basically have uh three

905
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
participants in the chain we have

906
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,020
registered uh Who provided uh non-ask

907
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,540
email address and is able to deal with

908
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,560
it

909
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,339
a register who registered that client

910
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:24,960
and should uh either be able to deal

911
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,880
with this address or reject the

912
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,359
registration and the registry that

913
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,200
normally should not uh contact uh with

914
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,940
uh the registrant or using any address

915
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,660
the situation

916
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,720
becomes more difficult in several cases

917
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,980
for example in case of uh domain

918
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,400
transfer the accepting register until

919
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
maybe not capable to deal with no mask

920
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,300
address but well I think that it's

921
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,940
mostly the problem of resistance

922
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,780
business the other situation that is uh

923
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,079
more difficult is uh the case of

924
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:18,480
oh well uh registry termination or

925
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,599
register termination when uh the the

926
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,240
data is passed to uh to a new

927
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
uh

928
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,000
companies that maybe not uh capable to

929
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,780
deal with no mask addresses but well

930
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,760
speaking frankly I think uh this uh

931
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,280
situation is quite rare

932
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,940
thank you okay thank you Dimitri as

933
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,460
you've seen with close queue we spent we

934
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,140
we reserved quite some time for this

935
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,520
discussion

936
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,900
um but we still have two poor

937
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,420
presentation so next for reaction John

938
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,359
if you can keep it short

939
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,480
yeah

940
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,560
I will try

941
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,180
first first first of all what I said in

942
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,680
the chat about something else in the

943
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,020
chat earlier is this transition period

944
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,780
likely to be forever it's not just the

945
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,400
technical problem it's a problem with

946
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,680
language and with local mua

947
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,020
implementations and with a bunch of

948
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,000
other things and as long as the working

949
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,180
group continues to think about European

950
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,619
languages

951
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,560
spaces between words and

952
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,740
an absence of not breaking characters

953
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,400
and a variety of other things this is

954
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,900
easy and the point you start thinking

955
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,420
about it other kinds of scripts very

956
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,700
different inventions it suddenly gets

957
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,540
hard

958
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,359
and that's where it gets hung up and

959
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,680
that's one of the alternate addresses

960
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,660
like that you needed for a very long

961
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,560
time

962
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,440
and

963
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,540
you know I I guess I just stopped there

964
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,220
because I'm gonna end up repeating

965
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,420
myself but again this is why uh why he's

966
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,700
talking to this is need to be there and

967
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,260
in addition

968
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,859
why you need to think about

969
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:09,420
less just what's happening in this

970
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,220
particular transaction or what's

971
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,480
happening in these addresses when they

972
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,700
go into registry databases and who want

973
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,920
to be able to access them afterwards

974
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,079
whether voluntarily on the part of the

975
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,599
registry side or involuntarily on the

976
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,400
part of some right sub-regulator or

977
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,300
legal side

978
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,859
okay thank you John uh

979
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,140
next up is Vienna Vera if you can keep

980
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,578
it short as well

981
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,079
do you have any more comments

982
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,940
I guess not so

983
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,040
okay sorry I looked for the button on

984
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,960
the wrong on the wrong place

985
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,680
um we've had a need for alternative

986
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,240
email addresses for already 25 years ago

987
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,300
specifically when the email address ends

988
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,280
in the domain name itself and once it is

989
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,400
taken down then you cannot contact the

990
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,140
uh the party

991
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,900
so wouldn't that be good opportunities

992
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,880
you just be totally liberal and say

993
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,800
there's going to be an opportunity to

994
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,720
put more than one email address and not

995
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,060
care about distinctions whether this is

996
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,740
UTF SMTP

997
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,660
smtpdf8 or anything like that it's just

998
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,640
an alternative email address it serves a

999
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,940
purpose

1000
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,099
okay thank you

1001
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,500
um Jim if you're gonna go back two more

1002
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,760
slides and I'm gonna have some final

1003
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,900
questions or some some closing questions

1004
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,660
um because that's I think this is the

1005
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,700
one right

1006
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,740
um so the the question now is what are

1007
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,180
we going to do with this document this

1008
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,280
is basically a question tomorrow Murray

1009
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,520
because I think that uh James agreed

1010
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,619
that some of the changes to this

1011
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,800
document can be quite material so I

1012
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,900
don't know if we need to how the process

1013
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,520
works to get this document back into the

1014
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,740
working group to discuss these uh and I

1015
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,319
also

1016
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:31,079
saw that James said that you know the

1017
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,880
create command and the update command

1018
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,920
they all need to be extended so I I'm

1019
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,200
guessing that this needs some some more

1020
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,900
action to so what's the process here

1021
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,800
um

1022
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,660
I guess I'll take input from you about

1023
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,880
how big the Delta you think it would be

1024
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,660
if it's relatively easy to settle this

1025
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,800
um you can just leave it there and

1026
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,060
update it once and then we can continue

1027
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,740
it from there if you want to iterate it

1028
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,240
at several times I'll just return it to

1029
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,339
the working group and we'll do a an

1030
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,500
abbreviated last call the next time but

1031
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,060
you guys can like you're part of that

1032
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,500
decision I don't have to tell you one

1033
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,720
way or another okay so basically we need

1034
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,520
to discuss it on the mailing list and if

1035
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,440
we think that it's you know material and

1036
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,240
need some more work yeah let you know

1037
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,220
and does the working group think that

1038
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,020
they have a path forward from you like

1039
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,099
you know what edits you need to make or

1040
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,359
at least what things you need to go and

1041
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,660
discuss

1042
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,060
so

1043
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,400
um I would say that uh Jim Gould has

1044
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,160
already indicated he has a a revised

1045
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,660
document ready to go which is a starting

1046
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,400
point discussion we should certainly

1047
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,260
have him submit that get that published

1048
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,880
and then we have this little bit of

1049
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,099
nuance about when when we require both

1050
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,960
or not requireable so we'll have a

1051
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,400
little discussion we'll see what that

1052
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,619
turns into okay and then we'll make a

1053
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:41,940
decision about whether we need it back

1054
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,859
to us because it's material or we can

1055
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,500
just update it send it to you okay

1056
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,579
um

1057
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,099
I I don't want to sign John or anyone

1058
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:51,960
else up for work unnecessarily but I

1059
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,400
want to make sure that that they get

1060
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,140
those like it gets the right eyes on it

1061
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,660
so right so if you want need me to help

1062
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,339
coordinate additional external feedback

1063
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,940
please let me know

1064
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,859
okay thank you

1065
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:07,260
so we're just this

1066
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,119
all right it's close thank you all very

1067
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,400
much for the discussion and as said we

1068
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,339
will continue on the mailing list and uh

1069
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,200
James can publish a new version of the

1070
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,420
document to start that discussion

1071
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,359
and then we go over to a next

1072
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,000
presentation which is by Tom Harrison

1073
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,220
about

1074
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,140
our search

1075
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,199
[Music]

1076
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,119
all right thank you next slide

1077
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,119
yeah

1078
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,500
so there we are good

1079
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,839
uh so this is a fairly short document

1080
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:52,319
that defines some new search and search

1081
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,619
related functionality for IP ranges and

1082
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,940
asns the first part is sorry searching

1083
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,359
by handling by name for IPs and asns

1084
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,240
along the same lines as for uh domains

1085
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,240
and entities in the existing documents

1086
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,700
there's a new link relation for getting

1087
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,460
the next most specific set of objects

1088
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,819
for one of the hierarchical object types

1089
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,920
and there's also a bit of text that

1090
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,619
incorporates reverse search and extends

1091
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,339
its application to IP ranges and asms

1092
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,980
so the idea here is that an RAR that

1093
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,720
implements this functionality in

1094
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,599
conjunction with some of the existing

1095
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,720
extensions can reach feature parity with

1096
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,579
the who is server and that helps with

1097
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,339
transitioning people offers and onto art

1098
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:45,000
app which is uh good for us and it also

1099
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,640
can help with potential deprecation of

1100
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,380
whose services in future next celebrity

1101
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,480
foreign

1102
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,920
just shows the requests and responses

1103
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,859
for the searches by handling name are

1104
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,079
pretty straightforward the only real

1105
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,000
difference here is that there are new uh

1106
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,440
search response types for the new

1107
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,260
objects so there hasn't been an IP

1108
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,319
search or not num search defined before

1109
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:13,260
so this document includes that content

1110
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,720
next slide please

1111
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,060
and this one shows how the link relation

1112
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,119
works so there's no structure defined

1113
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,400
for the for the link itself it's

1114
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,200
entirely up to the server

1115
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,020
uh and the response is the same as for a

1116
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,500
search for uh the relevant objects type

1117
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,160
slide please

1118
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,140
most of how this document works is very

1119
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,000
straightforward that really couldn't

1120
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,880
work in another way except perhaps for

1121
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,579
the link relation part so the reason we

1122
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,859
went with the link relation here it

1123
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:49,319
keeps the interface really simple uh

1124
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,359
there are fewer chances for things to go

1125
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,420
wrong for clients to misinterpret what

1126
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,460
they're getting back uh it means we

1127
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,260
don't have to Define behavior in error

1128
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,020
codes and so on so that was the first

1129
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,060
reason for that and then the second

1130
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,680
reason which falls out of the first

1131
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,660
reason is that because there's more

1132
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,140
flexibility on the server side uh it

1133
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,940
just gives the server options as to how

1134
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,579
to handle this so one server might do

1135
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,040
inbound searches uh another server might

1136
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,260
trade-off disk with CPU and pre-generate

1137
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,200
everything ahead of time uh so yeah just

1138
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,280
give us some more options in that

1139
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,900
respect next slide please

1140
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,480
so next steps we're looking to get this

1141
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,599
adopted it may be that that can't happen

1142
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,700
right now because there's a lot of stuff

1143
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,680
in train particularly in the art app

1144
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,319
space uh so you can put that on input on

1145
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,760
that would be good

1146
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,300
uh we need to get input from the various

1147
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,060
sub-regional Registries that do add up

1148
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,460
so there are some national Registries in

1149
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,140
the opening region and in the laknik

1150
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,540
region that do this so we need to talk

1151
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,940
to them

1152
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,500
uh the document defines an idap

1153
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,359
conformance value like like every

1154
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,040
extension but it doesn't actually use

1155
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,040
that as a prefix in the searches and the

1156
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,560
reason for that is it's would leave

1157
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,720
these searches kind of misaligned with

1158
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,099
how things are defined in the core

1159
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,680
documents uh you don't you'd end up with

1160
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,359
a search and a chord document like slash

1161
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,900
domains for for a domain search but uh

1162
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,119
if a prefix were used here then it would

1163
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,300
be slash rir search underscore IPS so

1164
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,760
it's a little bit clunky but uh the

1165
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,500
existing requirements in this space mean

1166
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,359
that we really should have a prefix

1167
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:32,460
there so we need to think about how this

1168
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,800
can be handled if at all

1169
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,160
uh and we did an implementation of this

1170
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,319
at opening pretty simple all seems to

1171
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,700
work as expected but more

1172
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,119
implementations uh would be good

1173
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,780
that's it thanks

1174
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,740
okay thank you Tom are there any

1175
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,339
questions for Tom

1176
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't see anybody in the queue

1177
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,619
um

1178
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,079
yeah thank you Tom but you're

1179
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:02,880
um so your intent is to get this uh

1180
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,260
adopted

1181
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,119
um we will work for the world on the

1182
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:08,400
mailing list I presume and ask for uh

1183
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,400
for some more review okay so yeah

1184
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,400
so

1185
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,339
and you have a question go ahead

1186
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:20,760
uh yes so the more specific domain name

1187
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,220
is that about reverse DNS

1188
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,200
oh yeah that's just for the most in this

1189
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,359
so we probably should put some text in

1190
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,859
there just to say that it's not intended

1191
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,700
for use with uh with non-reverse domains

1192
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,339
um I suppose it could be used for normal

1193
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:36,780
domains but

1194
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,280
um yeah it might be better just to put

1195
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,359
that out

1196
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,060
all right and uh I I support the

1197
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,619
adoption of this of this work because I

1198
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:47,960
think it's it's needed so thank you

1199
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,799
okay thank you very much Tom

1200
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,079
then we have one final presentation

1201
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,819
I mark

1202
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:03,020
we're going into space

1203
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,740
hello uh

1204
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,440
adapt for space objects next next slide

1205
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,880
please

1206
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,079
so

1207
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,700
um

1208
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,740
so I've been involved with networking

1209
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,800
space and as you may know we're

1210
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,780
getting more and more networks in space

1211
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,720
and spacecrafts and all kind of stuff

1212
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,300
uh those objects in networks are

1213
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,640
actually owned by entities of locations

1214
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,540
of identity or network address

1215
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,520
um there might be there will be IP based

1216
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,220
networks as well as the other protocol

1217
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,280
that is more delayed and disruptive

1218
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,579
tolerant the dtn protocol is called

1219
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:53,040
bundle protocol

1220
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,260
um you know you could go to Sana which

1221
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,700
is

1222
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,760
um an entity created using the inm model

1223
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,880
but uh providing service for the space

1224
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,540
standards Community mainly ccsds ioeg

1225
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,819
and ISO and others

1226
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:09,839
so

1227
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,819
um in the context of uh offering access

1228
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:18,660
an access protocol to those objects that

1229
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,660
are registered to owners

1230
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,700
um the requirements were essentially 99

1231
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,960
in line with the requirements of rdap

1232
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,319
including rest API

1233
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,960
Downstream registries you know objects

1234
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,099
pointing to others and also uh things

1235
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:41,220
that are being discussed in the uh

1236
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,119
currently which is authenticated of oops

1237
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,900
authenticated access to some data

1238
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,780
some objects

1239
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,240
redacting some Fields all this stuff is

1240
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,280
exactly the same

1241
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,599
um

1242
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,280
and actually uh rdap space object server

1243
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,819
will eventually Also Serve rdap internet

1244
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:08,819
objects for example as I said there will

1245
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,240
be IP addresses that will be used in

1246
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,119
space and therefore the same rdap server

1247
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,920
may be also uh offering that information

1248
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,079
so the question is do we reinvent the

1249
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,140
wheel or we use airdap so the idea was

1250
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,339
to reuse our lab next slide

1251
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,640
um so the next slides are just examples

1252
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,839
um to show you you know what it could be

1253
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,940
um I actually

1254
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,300
used to create a prefix in the path for

1255
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,940
the queries just to not have any

1256
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,760
namespace Collision in the future but

1257
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,059
you know that's a detail next

1258
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,540
so um

1259
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,460
poor you know good or bad all objects

1260
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,359
have been identified using an object ID

1261
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,740
from the official ISO oid tree so any

1262
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,500
object for example these are actually

1263
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,300
you know real

1264
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,460
um you know objects number or object IDs

1265
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,319
that number the first one actually is

1266
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,920
the ID of the NASA Mars in a sense

1267
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,339
Arbiter spacecraft and the other one is

1268
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:26,760
uh the range of bundle protocol node

1269
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,400
numbers for NASA Goddard so you know

1270
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,900
these are real numbers next

1271
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,099
um

1272
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:38,099
yeah so that's another example of a

1273
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:41,700
query where similar to IP addresses now

1274
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,700
you're actually querying for node

1275
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,900
numbers

1276
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,480
um which is the uh as I said the bundle

1277
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,960
protocol way of addressing nodes

1278
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,020
um so that's an example of a range very

1279
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,140
similar to what we do with

1280
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,720
um IP addresses next slide

1281
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,400
given time Json responses uh

1282
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,800
since we started from scratch we

1283
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,540
preferred to use GS contact

1284
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,059
and two examples service site and

1285
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:17,119
aperture

1286
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,859
and

1287
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:21,720
these the current examples are actually

1288
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,260
not clean in terms of final because you

1289
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,200
know naming is actually dumped from the

1290
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,079
real database so you get it in that

1291
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:34,020
sense but as ND was pointing out on the

1292
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,460
mailing list you know these should be

1293
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:39,920
cleaning up property names next

1294
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,359
slide so this is again a real data of a

1295
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,720
service site in Norway with you know

1296
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,220
latitude longitude elevation

1297
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,339
you see pointing to other objects with

1298
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:58,980
their oid so you know this is something

1299
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,260
also that semantically we have in rdap

1300
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,819
currently

1301
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:05,520
um you know next slide

1302
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,760
uh this is a aperture uh I don't know

1303
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,099
which one is this one so you also have

1304
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:14,040
as aperture is the deep space network of

1305
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,220
NASA the big you know antennas the three

1306
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,740
antennas that are as big as this this

1307
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,780
building

1308
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,940
um next slide

1309
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,260
so

1310
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,920
um before you start uh usually the usual

1311
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,960
question so this has been discussed a

1312
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,000
bit in within the space community and

1313
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,520
one of the question was uh transport are

1314
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,079
we doing are that uh queries over you

1315
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,280
know

1316
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,099
um a link you know through Mars or

1317
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,220
something yeah maybe maybe not but that

1318
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,839
doesn't matter the fact that you're

1319
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,960
querying for information about an object

1320
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,180
is doesn't mean that you need to do this

1321
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,040
in space

1322
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,680
um that we will need to do some finding

1323
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,720
automative servers

1324
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,400
um similarly uh as we do War for uh our

1325
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,339
adap current objects so there's you know

1326
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:11,579
ideas there for uh the oid bootstraps

1327
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:15,480
registry maybe others next slide

1328
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,579
and I think I'm done

1329
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:19,079
so

1330
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:21,960
um question to the group is this is very

1331
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,520
very similar

1332
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,700
um you know examples where uh

1333
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,140
presented any interest in regex

1334
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,359
I think it would be very viable to be

1335
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,200
here probably not the same you know

1336
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,140
lower priority than others given that

1337
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,540
space networks are deployed slowly

1338
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,420
that's it

1339
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,280
thank you very much Mark are there any

1340
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,660
questions from the audience

1341
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,859
before

1342
00:57:57,859 --> 00:58:01,680
so you know we had a little hallway

1343
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,380
discussion already Mark about this and

1344
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,940
and you know

1345
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:10,680
the Epp and the uh art up protocol are

1346
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,260
supposed to work for any registry

1347
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,720
um with I think in our Charter it has

1348
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,900
one limitation and that it is for uh

1349
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,540
internet identifier objects

1350
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,960
um but anybody of course is free to use

1351
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,559
the provisioning protocol and the uh the

1352
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,260
data access protocol for any needs that

1353
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,579
they need so is your question basically

1354
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,099
would this be work you would like to be

1355
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,799
reviewed by the working group or do you

1356
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:44,839
want actually to have documents adopted

1357
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,119
um I think it is valuable that that

1358
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,700
regex at least review

1359
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,940
even better if we'd be adopted

1360
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,339
um but you know it's up to the working

1361
00:58:56,339 --> 00:59:00,480
group obviously and I would punt that

1362
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,000
you said on the internet right the

1363
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,740
internet and the fire well I would find

1364
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,440
that space networking is actually just

1365
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,619
an extension of the internet and soon we

1366
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:14,339
should be the same yeah I was just

1367
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:15,839
mentioning it because it is in our

1368
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,720
Charter right so we're yes within the

1369
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,140
shelter yeah

1370
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,819
okay any more questions

1371
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,799
if not then thank you Mark and we're

1372
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,000
looking forward to having that

1373
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,920
discussion in uh on the mailing list

1374
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,799
and that brings us to our next and last

1375
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:40,020
item which is

1376
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,299
any other business

1377
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:43,799
is there any other business that people

1378
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:46,520
want to discuss

1379
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:55,339
if not then we have one minute left

1380
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,880
oh there's still there's one more

1381
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,460
question from Victor so we'll give him

1382
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,540
the last minute

1383
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,220
yes

1384
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,700
um Gavin Brown is working on a proposal

1385
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,460
to add TTL data into requests from

1386
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,319
registrars to Registries I'll probably

1387
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,660
be putting my foot into that if people

1388
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,599
are interested in working on that and

1389
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,180
maybe have seen my presentations to oark

1390
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:28,319
and I can I encourage participation in

1391
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:32,220
thinking about how to uh make it safer

1392
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,460
to roll back uh changes that are

1393
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,540
regretted

1394
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,540
uh whether they're DNS like specifically

1395
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,740
or perhaps not even

1396
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,299
okay thank you Victor so if you have

1397
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:47,460
anything new to present you know send it

1398
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,240
to the list and uh if you get any

1399
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,160
positive feedback then ask for working

1400
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,020
group adoption that's the process that

1401
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,660
we usually take right

1402
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,700
okay thank you Victor and if there are

1403
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,160
no any other business then exactly on

1404
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,260

1419
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,980
and then we'll uh let you know yeah
