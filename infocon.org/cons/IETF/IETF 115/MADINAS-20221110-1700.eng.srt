00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,740
on the working group status

91
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,580
then we will move to the problem

92
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,600
statement uh by Jerome

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
then we will have a MAC address

94
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,580
randomization document Carlos will

95
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,780
present

96
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,280
we then want to have some open

97
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,100
discussion on the BCP

98
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,960
that we have prepared some some slides

99
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,940
that's the other Milestone that we have

100
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,800
in our group

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
then I will give you an update about the

102
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
open running experiment that we've been

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,160
discussing with the WPA

104
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,040
and we will discuss next steps that are

105
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,380
important from here to Yokohama

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,840
are there any questions or comments

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,560
about the agenda

108
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,020
right here none

109
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,099
you can go to the

110
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,880
working group updates

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,199
that was it okay

112
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,160
all right

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,220
thank you and welcome everyone to this

114
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,120
call sorry I'm not on site with you

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,880
um so um let's go to I mean this

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,800
document we've been discussing it a lot

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,660
so you know you probably are all aware

118
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,400
of um of what it says and what it

119
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
contains but

120
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,100
um as there were some interesting

121
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,860
conversations uh during the um on the

122
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,080
list I would like to to reassess where

123
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,120
we are and of course ask for for the

124
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,880
group inputs on on where we go next

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,080
um can you go the next slide I don't

126
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,539
seem to have control over the slides

127
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,740
um

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,740
thank you so as you remember we have two

129
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,419
documents in Flight we'll talk about the

130
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,100
other one in a few minutes but this one

131
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,840
is what we call We call we used to call

132
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,639
it the use the framework and now we call

133
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,220
it the use case and and the goal of this

134
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,740
document is to try to better refine you

135
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,120
know our definition of what a problem

136
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,740
space lies

137
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,479
um and for that we found you know two

138
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,860
years ago

139
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,160
um that we we couldn't agree on some uh

140
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,900
basic vocabulary definitions so what

141
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,819
this document does in the use case is

142
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,080
start by

143
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,300
um defining some terminology you know

144
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,860
when we say

145
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,360
um you know they can inspire you with

146
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,479
your Mac address who is they uh so in

147
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,860
this document you go through the

148
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,900
different actors that are involved in at

149
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,819
least to wireless network

150
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,919
um action and monitoring we also Define

151
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,539
your different types of devices the

152
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,560
difference between what we call a

153
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,620
personal device and a shared device and

154
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,780
here we borrow from the definitions from

155
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,759
from the IEEE

156
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,199
um then of course we look at the

157
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,240
technical entities you know the switches

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,580
rebounder the services the dhcpe or DNS

159
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,199
all these things but also the human

160
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,180
entities people who are you know spying

161
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,620
on you you know the eavesdroppers but

162
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,660
also people who administer uh the

163
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,280
network or administer the services of

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
the network and give you access to the

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,099
internet and people of course on the

166
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,099
internet and of course we also Define

167
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,840
some environments

168
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,340
um because it's clear that although we

169
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,800
shouldn't trust anybody anywhere sad

170
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
world and there are some places where

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,520
the level of Trust might be slightly

172
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,979
different for example if you are in a

173
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,960
public venue like you are here

174
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm expecting that the trust you have

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,400
um that you can send your unencrypted

176
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,960
credit card out over the years very

177
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,800
limited uh however if you move to an MDM

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,740
control device in a factory

179
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,479
um the level of trust that you have in

180
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,160
the network in the environment and the

181
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,199
network actors whether they are is

182
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,300
likely to be higher uh simply because

183
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
you know there is no likely pii on your

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,620
device and also the environment might be

185
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,840
controlled so we Define these different

186
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
environments and of course we Define

187
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
this different level of trusts

188
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,720
um so that's the general structure of

189
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,919
the document

190
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,660
um as you you may remember we went back

191
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,120
and forth on on the early definitions of

192
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,620
this documents and we spend a lot of

193
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,400
work

194
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,080
um and there you know together as a

195
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,419
group to try to Define exactly the scope

196
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,340
of that document so that's getting to a

197
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,160
point of Fairly good stability

198
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,979
um then as we form the the WG

199
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,020
um we had a few edits on these documents

200
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,940
and you see here a list

201
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,640
um the latest update is what we have now

202
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,559
as b as V3

203
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,580
which occurs between our last

204
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,540
inter meeting call and this meeting

205
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,660
where we had two types of edits one is a

206
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,620
typo fixing and I received typos and I

207
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,420
heard from some of you that were still

208
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,700
typos I'm expecting there is still typos

209
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,620
so please mention them

210
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,360
um if you tell me there are typos it's

211
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,820
not useful tell me where you see a typo

212
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,920
so I can correct it I'm sure there are

213
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
still a few of them but the other thing

214
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,200
we did also was that in V2 in the last

215
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,519
section of this argument which is

216
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,339
section seven we started listing what we

217
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,660
call solutions that were already

218
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,519
existing I think we mentioned among

219
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,420
others wp2 up and looming and a few more

220
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,760
in this V3 I received comments offline

221
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,260
of people say oh you should also mention

222
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,880
this there is also that solution and so

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,360
on and I Incorporated those however one

224
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,519
big mishap I did and I like to apologize

225
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,860
to the group for that is that I received

226
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,180
those comments and I made the

227
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,640
integration and posted a new revision

228
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,899
where it's not what I should have done I

229
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,160
should have you know at least you know

230
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,519
pull the branch from GitHub and you know

231
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,899
communicate it back to at least a

232
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,880
suggestion for for where you know the

233
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,220
changes should be so you know I I intend

234
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,380
to fix that and in fact um thankfully

235
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,140
there were some some dialogues uh

236
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,120
following uh this uh this update which

237
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
is is going to help you know fix that

238
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,320
um at this point in this V3 of this

239
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,420
document it seems that you know the goal

240
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,820
is to look at the use cases so that

241
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,100
section in section seven where we look

242
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,940
at Solutions might not be uh the um

243
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,040
element that is uh entirely needed

244
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,260
anymore uh I mean it may be very useful

245
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,820
for another document but if we are

246
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,380
focusing in these documents in the use

247
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,120
to the use cases

248
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,680
um this is not use case it's a solution

249
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,660
so maybe that section doesn't belong to

250
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,180
these documents however and some of you

251
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,880
have been Michael in particular have

252
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,260
been suggesting that we should probably

253
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,080
add to our group task uh the creation of

254
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,459
a third document which could be

255
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,200
something like a BCP

256
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
in that case you know that document

257
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,860
would be examining you know the possible

258
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,440
solutions and maybe that section 7 would

259
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,260
fit better in that new document than it

260
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,620
is in this document so one possibility

261
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,360
um you know to fix the addition that I

262
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
did without

263
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,779
um getting the full uh feedback from the

264
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,300
group is to move those additions in fact

265
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,100
the entire section seven on Solutions

266
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,399
into a form of NX so we can store that

267
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,200
section there until the group you know

268
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,420
maybe today or maybe you know in in the

269
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,700
in in on the mailer or maybe on next

270
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,459
meeting decides uh if we create BCP and

271
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,140
if that material can be useful for that

272
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,000
BCP I think it would be you know ways to

273
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
destroy it but you know at least storage

274
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,980
maybe in an X also um feedback I got a

275
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,100
lot about is about the section 6.3 I'm

276
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,779
not going to flash it here but you may

277
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,339
remember this is what we call the

278
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,560
requirements formulation

279
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,420
um and what this is is a list of

280
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,820
elements that we think are useful for

281
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,760
the group to continue with its activity

282
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,339
um and what happened there um is that if

283
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,980
this was useful when we were creating

284
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,079
um these documents but at this point

285
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,700
sorry this is a working group but at

286
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,740
this point the group is created so it

287
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,620
seems that this section 6.3 has

288
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,019
fulfilled its goal and it's not really

289
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,120
useful in the context of the use case

290
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,880
document anymore so my proposal would

291
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
also be to delete that section 6.3 which

292
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,620
is not necessary so those are the two

293
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,880
main things that I would like to offer

294
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,459
to the group for for feedback of course

295
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,800
you know I can always undo the type of

296
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,420
fixing but you know I think this is

297
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,339
Trivial thing that we want to do anyway

298
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,019
so let me pause there I see there is a

299
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,420
really a hand raised so we can get

300
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,500
feedback

301
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,700
thanks uh Carlos Carlos I have a couple

302
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,440
of questions or comments one is

303
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,779
regarding the requirements

304
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,300
um I think that in our Charter we we

305
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,579
have to that we have to or we are

306
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,560
expected to provide that use cases and

307
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,079
requirements documents so I think

308
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,860
requirement should still be there where

309
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,240
although I I agree that there are some

310
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,399
of the requirements that are there

311
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,899
currently that probably should be

312
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,300
removed because I like more requirements

313
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,579
for the community on what needs to be

314
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,240
done not requirements regardless of RCM

315
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,480
and it identification and all these kind

316
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
of things those I think belong to this

317
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,079
document the other ones probably not

318
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,079
don't that's my first comment

319
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,959
and then uh second comment is on the on

320
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,579
the actual use cases the document is

321
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,079
called use cases well it's not called

322
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,060
use question requirements currently I

323
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,220
think we should probably change in the

324
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,860
the name if we keep the requirements to

325
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,480
reflect that that will be the second

326
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,459
command and then there is a third one

327
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:22,319
there is as currently uh

328
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,120
uh basically explaining the document

329
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,880
although there are use cases there is a

330
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,519
maybe a bit higher at the first read to

331
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,500
find the use cases because we are

332
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,240
talking about the trans relationships

333
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,000
and the network environment so

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,760
not really in the shape of classical use

335
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,720
cases maybe like in the WBA document is

336
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,000
explained so I don't know that that may

337
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
be worth trying to do a bit of rewriting

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,940
to to make the content more use cases I

339
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,180
like that will be my my third comment

340
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,800
thank you and while you're on the mic

341
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,279
may may I ask you for clarification

342
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,139
um so so do you envision that we would

343
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,019
add a section that would be use cases or

344
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,600
we would you know re war prosection that

345
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
we would be yeah

346
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,620
I think that that's a personal comment

347
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,060
so I mean you may disagree and the

348
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,040
working group May disagree but I I think

349
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,740
I was expecting more like use cases

350
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,019
section or something that is like use

351
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,779
case a b c and d and we don't have that

352
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,279
in the document percent now we have like

353
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,260
the trust levels and then we have the

354
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,639
the different environments the

355
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,959
environments at the end of the day is

356
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,860
kind of the the use cases referring to

357
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,480
the to the trust levels but it's not

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,940
explicit so I think something more may

359
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,380
help in the reliability of the document

360
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,899
but that's my personal opinion

361
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,440
it makes sense to me yeah thank you

362
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,880
okay thanks

363
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,920
thanks Carlos

364
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,060
um Eric

365
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,959
giving

366
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,180
a thing indeed that we need the BCP

367
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,459
document so we'll talk about it later in

368
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,740
the agenda so xiaom I think your

369
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,860
suggestions to move this part out of

370
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,279
your document into the draft or skeleton

371
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,680
of another BCP document it's a really

372
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,420
good idea

373
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,219
all right thank you thank you very much

374
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,420
okay

375
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,519
thank you very much

376
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,820
I don't think

377
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,820
yeah sorry

378
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,100
hello you

379
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,339
um we cannot hear you sorry

380
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,720
can you hear me now

381
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,000
yes

382
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,380
yeah so my question is I think from the

383
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,420
BCP I think I try to follow up with uh

384
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,380
Carlos comments so for the vcp document

385
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,600
uh are we going to I mean are we going

386
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,779
to address per environment or you try to

387
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,480
address it per usual a use case because

388
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,459
I think like what Kyle says like the

389
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,940
current draft it it doesn't contain a

390
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,860
concrete use cases so I just want to

391
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,180
hear

392
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,100
um from you like what you propose for

393
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,240
the PCP thank you

394
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,839
so I mean my my comment was regarding

395
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,880
the the use cases I think that we need

396
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
to describe a bit more into use cases

397
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,339
format kind of the use cases so it's a

398
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,680
bit about restructuring a bit the

399
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,480
content that we have so this is kind of

400
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,519
independent on the on the BCP so the BCP

401
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,980
I think is more related to the solution

402
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,800
part that I guess that discussion should

403
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
be moved to the to a different document

404
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,699
so we keep separated the use cases and

405
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,500
requirements from the actual BCP

406
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
I think my question is like for the BCP

407
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,820
structure I think today you usually mean

408
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,880
BCP usually address uh you try to adjust

409
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,400
a scenario or a use case for the BCP

410
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,319
effort like What scenario to use what

411
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,799
this is called yep well that that's up

412
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,660
for the working group to discuss because

413
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,520
sometimes also the vcp is more related

414
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,199
to how to address the requirements right

415
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,439
not necessarily the use cases so the

416
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,240
structure I don't have a strong opinion

417
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,740
I will probably start from the

418
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,000
requirements

419
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,859
and then how to address the requirements

420
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,439
with the PCP but I guess there may be

421
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,419
other ways of doing it

422
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,760
okay okay I think okay I think I got you

423
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,160
so in this case you so what we need to

424
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,380
do here I think uh for the use case

425
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,220
we'll have to know explicitly uh

426
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,720
either like doing a use case or

427
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,220
requirements so that then because I

428
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,299
think in the end I want to make sure

429
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,360
that the PCP addressed something that we

430
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,039
really are clear what the problems we

431
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,520
try to solve

432
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,340
I'm putting myself in the queue and uh

433
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,020
yeah I think just just to add a couple

434
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,140
of comments I I agree and just at least

435
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,000
in my mind that the structure would be

436
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,460
we need to identify the the set of use

437
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,860
cases what are the requirements for each

438
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,080
one of these use cases then we need to

439
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
identify what existing solutions they

440
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,260
are

441
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,960
and we we provide what are the the best

442
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,700
common practices regarding the solutions

443
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,840
because we don't know if these Solutions

444
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,919
are being implemented or not or uh if if

445
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,780
there is no issue to solve or if there

446
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,419
is a gap so that that is basically the

447
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,640
outcome that the BCP will provide this

448
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
is the best common practice that you

449
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,179
should there is a solution you should

450
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,600
use it or we may find out that there is

451
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,539
a gap holding one of the use cases for

452
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,640
One requirement in which case we will

453
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,740
figure out what to do if we need to talk

454
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,900
to other organizations other working

455
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,179
groups if we need to recharger Etc but

456
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,640
that we won't not know until we have

457
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,500
identified the use cases

458
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,660
and the requirements

459
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,780
so so again PCP is is what it says best

460
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,580
common practices on on existing

461
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,000
Solutions

462
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,320
okay so I think

463
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,639
we can move to the next

464
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,520
then you

465
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,799
hmm

466
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
okay so this is uh Carlos bernardo's

467
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,059
representing the draft on behalf of my

468
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,980
course so next slide please

469
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,600
so there's a brief introduction of what

470
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,400
this document is about this document is

471
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,380
about documenting the State of Affairs

472
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,480
regarding the the mark average

473
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,720
randomization the RCM in ITF and other

474
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,080
sdos and also including what vendors

475
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,600
mobile OS vendors are are doing

476
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,940
uh so what you have the details in the

477
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,679
slide but there's a reminder of what we

478
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,240
are talking about in this document next

479
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,660
slide please

480
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,500
maybe you can want to speak a little

481
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,100
closer to him

482
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,160
okay let's should be now best better

483
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,200
okay so this is the table of content and

484
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm highlighting in yellow the changes

485
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,720
from the last ITF uh cycle

486
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,440
so there were uh a couple of more than a

487
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,840
couple of uh pull requests from Michael

488
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,700
regarding the

489
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,919
thing is that we should or we could do

490
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,660
in the in the document and we discussed

491
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,400
that in the in the last meeting about

492
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,500
that taxonomy we discussed that that was

493
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,240
a good idea to encode in the document

494
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,940
although we need to really check uh what

495
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,799
we are putting there to avoid any

496
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,280
anxiety so at this point in time I

497
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,960
basically added the content provided by

498
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,520
Michael thanks again Michael for playing

499
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,280
that and I would like to uh we will go

500
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,140
through that in the next slide but I

501
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,660
will benefit from this chance to ask for

502
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,580
feedback to the working group so we

503
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,039
really need input from all you guys to

504
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,720
to improve the content that is there in

505
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,460
the taxonomy I think that taxonomy is a

506
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,380
useful thing to have next slide please

507
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,059
so this is a summary of the taxonomy so

508
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,500
basically it's about the different

509
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,900
policies that maybe follow for card

510
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,120
reselection and there are like

511
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,340
five uh different approaches or

512
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,919
categories there the classical one that

513
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,780
is the per vendor of UE Mac address so

514
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,059
the Legacy or the the one that we will

515
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,240
have in in most of the devices up to the

516
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,240
recent past that is the device has a

517
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,240
pre-burn MAC address there and this is

518
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,580
the one that is used and then we have a

519
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,880
set of different approaches per device

520
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,980
generated Mac addresses so basically

521
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,280
this is randomly generated by the device

522
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,159
and is done at the beginning of the

523
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,600
lifetime of the device and then is used

524
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,760
for the rest of the operational lifetime

525
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,380
of that device that's a possible

526
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,780
approach we need to really recommend it

527
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,620
when this may make sense and and

528
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,600
possible issues then we have the purple

529
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,120
generated Mac address in this case this

530
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,919
address is generated per Boot and it's

531
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,039
not a store in any permanent storage so

532
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,500
this basically means that that address

533
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,100
will change on a per boot basis

534
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,200
then we have the one that is more

535
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,539
typically used now

536
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,260
um

537
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,020
for by mobile OSS that is the pernet

538
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,059
originated Mac address so basically you

539
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,940
generate and use on a per Network basis

540
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,360
this randomly generated address and

541
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,000
typically indexed by SSID so that's what

542
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,500
I mean by

543
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,799
per Network basis and then the purpose

544
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,179
you generated Mac address that is

545
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,340
basically a way of rotating the address

546
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,799
so the mobile OSS use a kind of a

547
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,720
combination depending on the OS on the

548
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,000
last two policies the per Network

549
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,059
generated and the generated marketers so

550
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,760
I think this is good and a good way of

551
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,860
kind of documenting all the possible

552
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,200
approaches and again I would like to ask

553
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,559
for feedback on additional policies that

554
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,480
we may be missing in the document and

555
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,520
completing the the the way we have

556
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,320
documented them next slide please

557
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,000
and this is just a summary of changes so

558
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,059
in the last two revisions which are the

559
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,700
ones that took place between last ATF

560
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,039
and this ITF basically we added a

561
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,679
section on taxonomy we removed some BCP

562
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,840
14 terminology that we have or text that

563
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960
we have in the Dera but didn't apply and

564
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,360
and we also added some other minor

565
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,720
things that were submitted by by means

566
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,240
of guitar requests put requests from

567
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,520
from Michael so basically those are the

568
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,539
main changes

569
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,400
and this is it

570
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,940
thanks thank you very much

571
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,640
so we have a question from Mr Richardson

572
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
and Eric

573
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,100
fers are getting shorter and shorter

574
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
Michael Richardson so I just wanted to

575
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,340
thank you for accepting it I'm going to

576
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,320
try to point out to the group that

577
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,880
some of those policies are stupid

578
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
policies and part of the point of of

579
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,880
naming them is so that you can say that

580
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,120
device has a stupid policy and whatever

581
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,860
and the vendor could say oh yeah that's

582
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,200
what policy we're doing okay and it

583
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,940
could be that there are other policies

584
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,179
that are don't fit into that

585
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,520
but that some people are doing

586
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,380
and they're also stupid

587
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,179
and we should also give them names for

588
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,980
the simple reason of being able to

589
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,580
discuss what are bad ideas right

590
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,360
um and I and I I also wanted to say that

591
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,919
um

592
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,020
there's lots of cheap pieces of Hardware

593
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,700
that don't have

594
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,799
ouis uh in them

595
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,100
and you turn them on and they do

596
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,780
something and so they're actually using

597
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,419
per boot generated Mac addresses but not

598
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,799
because they thought they should do that

599
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,179
but because they actually didn't know

600
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,220
they had to put an oui in their device

601
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,440
and they come up at zero zero zero zero

602
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,960
and then some random numbers at the end

603
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,220
and you know so they're actually doing

604
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,760
some privacy stuff by mistake oh until

605
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,960
you get three of them on your network

606
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,960
and then your network melts so it could

607
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,640
very well be that there's a policy

608
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,380
that's not in this list and I guess

609
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,000
let's say per Network generate Mac

610
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,100
address that's what all the mobile

611
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,740
devices did five years ago suddenly

612
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,260
right and

613
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,840
um and then Apple and others have have

614
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,179
moved to the generating a new one every

615
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,659
12 hours or something like that and

616
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,299
um

617
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:41,100
uh that I guess it just falls down on

618
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,120
its own

619
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,520
um and I think that's the one that

620
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,020
that's the policy which we all would

621
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,460
like to use and it's the one that gives

622
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,580
us the most problem elsewhere

623
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,779
yeah one question basically uh following

624
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,940
up on your comment I think that what the

625
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,100
mobile OS devices are doing today is

626
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,440
closer closer to the mic sorry uh I

627
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,299
think that what the mobile OSS are doing

628
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,039
today is more a combination of the two

629
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,100
let the last policies right because it's

630
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,960
rotating the MAC address but it's doing

631
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,600
on a pair SSID basis so maybe I don't

632
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,760
know if we should uh I don't know if

633
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,860
generate a new policy or comment but I

634
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,240
think it's a combination of both right

635
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,880
right it could be as my understanding is

636
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,620
from the settings I've seen and things

637
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,779
and what Dave Taylor and we've discussed

638
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,059
in previous meetings is that in most

639
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,980
cases you either tell the device use

640
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,500
them a permanent address that I told you

641
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,760
that you had

642
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,919
use the address the same one you had

643
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,900
last time which is per Network generated

644
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,080
Mac address or randomly change it

645
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,700
periodically and as far as I know the

646
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,020
randomly change it periodically doesn't

647
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,740
like come back to the same address ever

648
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,659
on the same network

649
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,679
so

650
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,020
like it's a like there's no relationship

651
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,000
as far as I know when you do that so so

652
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,880
maybe if I go author just just trying to

653
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,000
respond there I mean it varies also from

654
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,600
a version version of the OS or right but

655
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,720
uh latest things is is mainly you make

656
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,400
sure that you don't change while you are

657
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,559
associated to the network so that you

658
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,539
don't break your connections but as soon

659
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,400
as you disassociate yeah well if you

660
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,080
pass over the period Then you can get a

661
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,799
new address okay so so actually that's a

662
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,840
new policy that's different because my

663
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,460
understanding from our previous meetings

664
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,679
is that there were devices that while

665
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,059
you were associated with the same

666
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,080
network

667
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,520
we're going to change their Mac address

668
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,460
which causes them to disassociate and

669
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,740
reassociate okay because you can't you

670
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,799
can't do WPA uh with changing your

671
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,220
address but until they fix something

672
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,260
um but

673
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,000
um that they would do that regardless

674
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,679
but you're telling me that there's

675
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,900
another policy which is that each time

676
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,480
you connect you get a new Mac address

677
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,440
but it it it doesn't expire

678
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,559
while you are associated uh that was the

679
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,960
recommendation related to at 11 then so

680
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,820
if I if I walk out of the hotel

681
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:12,240
I walked down the street I come back in

682
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,520
then I'll have a new Mac address

683
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,020
even though it's only been 10 minutes

684
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,460
that I've been gone

685
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,340
if you decide to do uh what they call

686
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,100
the Privacy which is do random yes uh

687
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,840
otherwise if you say you remember this

688
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,779
network you may want you good so that's

689
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,520
a new one it would be a per connection

690
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,919
generated Mac address or something like

691
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,600
that per session I don't know someone

692
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,880
pick a word I'm looking at Lorenzo

693
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,100
because you might know no doesn't know

694
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,140
that part doesn't know every line of

695
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,320
Android

696
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,600
yeah that's the thing like if because I

697
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,919
just walked out of the room and did

698
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,360
disassociated or I went into the

699
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,860
bathroom I came out that would really be

700
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,120
annoying I'd have to go to the portal

701
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,220
again so there must be some you'd think

702
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,720
that they would have some minimum time

703
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,799
but

704
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,539
yeah

705
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,400
in mind I have to check what the devices

706
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,400
do today but uh it's uh basically as I

707
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,440
say a combination of both so you have a

708
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,960
different Mac addresses ID yes and on

709
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,000
that one you may rotate that one every

710
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,640
whatever amount of time like one day two

711
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,500
days or whatever so it's a kind of a

712
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,600
combination of both but not necessarily

713
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,299
that every time you change network you

714
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,580
need a new one so so I would like to

715
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,460
extend that with that concept and as I

716
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,320
said I think it's important that we

717
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,600
document even if it's even if it's only

718
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,480
one rev of one operating system done

719
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,940
something weird right I think it's

720
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,799
important that we document that for the

721
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,320
simple reason that

722
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,760
um someone else is going to do that or

723
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,620
show up with that wrong thing or think

724
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,740
it's a good idea and so we need to to

725
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,899
say be able to say to them and carve the

726
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,179
conversation are you doing this and they

727
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,320
go yeah yeah that's what we've been

728
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,760
doing I'm doing like this well maybe you

729
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,419
want to consider doing ppgm not this

730
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,980
other thing right great

731
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,659
thanks thanks uh Eric everything

732
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,059
just a very small thing but important

733
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,279
the name of the device is Mac address

734
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,039
randomization the other draft use

735
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,919
randomize and changing Mac address so

736
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,799
reflect this randomize and Mac address

737
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,659
State of Affair or status or something

738
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,100
like that just to be consistent thank

739
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,260
you yeah thanks we will do that thank

740
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,460
you thanks Matthew

741
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,480
uh yes uh can you hear me correctly

742
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,240
uh yeah if you speak a little closer to

743
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,679
the mic probably it's going to be better

744
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,539
try to do it yeah I just wanted to say

745
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,880
that the the idea of choosing a per

746
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,460
station uh the name per session I think

747
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,480
is uh

748
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,140
is a good one my opinion

749
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,080
right as compared to per Network yes

750
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,200
or or it's a different one okay

751
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,059
good enough

752
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,640
okay thank you very much

753
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,700
um

754
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,658
all right

755
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,260
foreign

756
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,179
so now we're moving to the next topic

757
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,820
which is the vcp handling RCM document

758
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,740
should I sure yeah

759
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,100
okay so if that's okay let me practice

760
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,960
from here

761
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,220
um

762
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,080
so this is a reminder of of the

763
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,640
discussion we had in the beginning so so

764
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,279
we have

765
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:43,500
these uh deliverables in our Charter

766
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,760
right

767
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,039
first and I'm copy pasting from the

768
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,580
charter literally so we have a document

769
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,899
documenting current state of affairs and

770
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,419
we have two informal informational uh

771
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:55,799
documents one is the use cases and

772
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,020
identity requirements document and we

773
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,460
heard already the presentation from

774
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,480
Jerome

775
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,179
then we have uh the MAC address

776
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,039
randomization current set of a first

777
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,779
document then we heard the presentation

778
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:10,500
from Carlos and we are missing this uh

779
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,080
third one which is the the BCP document

780
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,080
that uh we've been talking about

781
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,360
so

782
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,279
taking again another part of the draft

783
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,140
of the charter

784
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,020
um separating here in three different

785
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,360
colors just to make it easier

786
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,380
so uh let me read it quickly the green

787
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,080
part we will generate a BCP document

788
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,940
that will recommend means to reduce the

789
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,779
impact of RCM on the documented use

790
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:43,080
cases while ensuring that privacy is not

791
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,320
compromised so fair enough we need to

792
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,100
debate the BCP needs to rely on the use

793
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,980
cases that will be documented in the

794
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,620
first informational document

795
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,779
then if we go to the blue part we will

796
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,120
also recommend of course that cbcp part

797
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,340
existing protocols that can be used to

798
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,899
protect the request and exchange of

799
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,600
identifiers between the client and the

800
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,919
service provider

801
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,279
so this is basically what our the MAC

802
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,559
address was used for before and if we

803
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,419
want to preserve the Network Services we

804
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:16,919
need to exchange these identifiers

805
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,620
between client and service provider

806
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,080
and we will first recommend whatever

807
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,600
existing Solutions are there

808
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,200
to do so moving on to the purple part

809
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,059
the working group will work together

810
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,240
with other working groups at the ietf

811
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,539
for instance the HC interior we will

812
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,519
also liaise with other relevant or

813
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,620
organizations like we've been talking to

814
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,159
high triple 802 and the WBA to

815
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,080
coordinate on these recommendations as

816
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,820
well as potential follow-up activities

817
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,240
within or outside the ietf

818
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,000
so uh basically what we are saying here

819
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,279
is that we need to of course first

820
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,620
identify the use cases these

821
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,940
requirements that's the part that we

822
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,640
were talking uh earlier with with Jerome

823
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,340
and to answer uh the question that we

824
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,679
heard from from you we will first

825
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,918
recommend whatever is existing there

826
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,159
and we will not constrain to ietf

827
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,619
Solutions so so we could also consider

828
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:22,199
data 2.1x we could also consider uh pass

829
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,260
point so this solutions can come from I

830
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,000
triple 80802 can come from the Wi-Fi

831
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,639
Alliance we are discussing actively with

832
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,879
the WBA and all that is still in our

833
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,699
scope so we're not limited to only

834
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,540
pointing to rfcs from the high ETF if

835
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,980
ever there's a solution that makes sense

836
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,659
uh

837
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,659
we have in our mandate to talk about it

838
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,940
document it and and recommend it even in

839
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,619
our BCP

840
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,980
if of course we found some gaps

841
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,800
then that's a different discussion and

842
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,080
at that point we may say okay well is

843
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,839
this Gap in a nato2

844
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,420
11 specifications let's talk to them and

845
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,940
let them figure out if they will do

846
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,580
something in nato2 at 11 BH if there is

847
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,200
a gap in with the Wi-Fi Alliance then

848
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,780
we're going to talk to them if what WBA

849
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,119
is doing makes sense we can also adopt

850
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,060
it but if ever there's an issue with an

851
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,180
ietf document at that point I guess we

852
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,280
would need to see if it's in the scope

853
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,020
of one of the existing working groups so

854
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,060
if there's something else to do but

855
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,700
basically we cannot do any of that until

856
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,280
we have identified the use cases clearly

857
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,500
the requirements for each one of these

858
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,440
use cases and this we have evaluated

859
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,960
existing solutions that are out there so

860
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,780
that is I guess the main point of having

861
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,040
the first two documents in a good shape

862
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,740
so that we can start uh talking about

863
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,780
BCP I'm not saying we will wait until

864
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,119
those documents are are published we can

865
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,280
work in parallel but we need to keep in

866
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,940
mind that the BCP it's a follow-up of

867
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,140
the earlier document

868
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,560
um

869
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,260
so let me stop here and see if there are

870
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,280
any questions

871
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,140
I'm sorry

872
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,820
uh

873
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,740
um the next is is about the the

874
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,839
discussions with the WBA on the open

875
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,619
roaming so

876
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,020
if we have something on the BCP let's

877
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,740
talk about it now

878
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,680
Michael Richardson again so

879
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,180
um fundamentally my opinion okay on the

880
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,880
BCP is there's a whole bunch of things

881
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,280
that we just have to stop doing

882
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,040
that's the recommendation is stop doing

883
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,079
WPA psk

884
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,820
because

885
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,859
um it just doesn't work when everyone

886
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,839
knows the psk

887
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,760
um because you just get you know evil

888
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,859
twins and they just put up a thing and

889
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,119
then they get all your privacy

890
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,060
information right so that's a a for

891
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,700
example just doesn't work right what

892
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,119
we're doing in the ietf with our Network

893
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,640
don't validate certificate

894
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,760
again doesn't work because

895
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,859
people just take your your credit your

896
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,099
your uh uh they just watch you in Layer

897
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,500
Two and the whole point of the RCM

898
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,960
becomes moot right

899
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,520
so I think there's a bunch of things

900
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,640
don't have an open non-encrypted Hotel

901
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,920
Network and a portal

902
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,200
you can't it can't work and also when

903
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,880
you change your Mac address you have to

904
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,200
go through the portal again which pisses

905
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,640
everyone off which means they turn off

906
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,339
the RCM for the Hilton which means that

907
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,260
effectively anything that makes you turn

908
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,180
off RCM

909
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,079
is effectively an attack is my opinion

910
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
so that means that we have to somehow

911
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,200
move to having EAP TLS otherwise known

912
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,940
as WP Enterprise

913
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,980
and we have to make it easy

914
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,720
and

915
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,760
um I don't see any way of any other

916
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,380
direction like that has to be our

917
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,320
recommendation and

918
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,820
um if

919
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,740
if that's too hard

920
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,619
or whatever then my answer is okay I

921
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,119
guess you didn't really want privacy

922
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,300
okay and and that's okay you can make

923
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,880
that decision right I really don't care

924
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,520
if anyone knows my fridge is talking to

925
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,200
my access point because it's my fridge

926
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,140
and it doesn't go to coffee shops and it

927
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,060
doesn't go anywhere else and that's all

928
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,800
right okay

929
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,320
contains the coffee doesn't go to the

930
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,060
coffee right

931
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,800
um so I think that's something that I

932
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,119
think we really need to make clear and

933
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,560
that RCM is is a is a a benefit and it

934
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,060
comes with a cost

935
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,980
and we have to decide if we're willing

936
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,320
to pay that cost or not and one of the

937
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,940
costs is that means we actually have to

938
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,700
have identities that are usable from in

939
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,880
our devices that people can do things

940
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,460
so that's really all I say I'm willing

941
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,859
to work on this document but um you know

942
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,000
you're going to have to put something

943
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
someone else with me

944
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,960
to kind of hold me down a bit because

945
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,940
you won't like the result otherwise you

946
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,440
may not like the results or it may be

947
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,839
too radical that's all

948
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,839
thanks Michael so uh

949
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,640
uh

950
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,980
am I right if I say that you're

951
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,320
suggesting that we not only work on the

952
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,460
do's but also on the don't

953
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:27,000
um

954
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,680
sure

955
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,380
um do look both ways before crossing the

956
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,720
street okay

957
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,180
don't step onto the street with your

958
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,200
eyes closed so I mean that's it's the

959
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,480
same advice okay

960
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
um and in here you will get killed

961
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,680
because you look the wrong way

962
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,000
um but

963
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
um

964
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,800
so yeah so we have to be clear uh when

965
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,240
we're making a recommendation we're

966
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,460
going to have to be clear why other

967
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,680
things do not work so there was a

968
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,180
recommendation a suggestion we could

969
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,579
have a DHCP option to tell a portal that

970
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,500
where the same guy is lost time

971
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,060
I'm like well

972
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,960
that's that's just a a new p a new

973
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,960
easier way to get your identity

974
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,500
uh for an attacker to me and

975
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,380
um yeah so for instance don't use EAP

976
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,720
TLS 1.2

977
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,760
because your certificate will be in the

978
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,280
clear over EAP

979
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,760
do use eapt less 1.3 which is just

980
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,760
barely a RFC at this point

981
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,099
um because you get to encrypt your

982
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,440
certificate and you get to validate the

983
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,020
server uh cert before you send your

984
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,260
client certificate okay so that's a

985
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,780
particular thing so that may require you

986
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,420
know what it may require an uplift of

987
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,720
stocks all over the place and it might

988
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,160
be that we can't do it for two years

989
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,160
right but I mean at least we can write

990
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,900
the RFC that says this is what you're

991
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,980
supposed to do

992
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,119
um for that

993
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,119
yep thanks uh I I agree and I think that

994
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,280
that goes in line with at least from my

995
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,900
point of view with the

996
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,780
the philosophy and intention of ietf in

997
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,099
general when we have for instance

998
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,980
security considerations it's uh also to

999
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,920
make sure that whoever reads the RFC

1000
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,619
understands what are the other things

1001
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,420
that they have to consider whenever they

1002
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,520
Implement uh specifications so in this

1003
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,700
case to make makes perfect sense also

1004
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,040
you make me think that uh the latest

1005
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,200
discussions in the Wi-Fi Alliance for

1006
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,859
instance are indeed uh talking about uh

1007
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,220
securing uh uh uh beacons and stuff like

1008
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,280
that so so it's true that we may not be

1009
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,599
aware of all the things that are

1010
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,920
happening so a lot of these are

1011
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,619
upgrades to previous versions so uh and

1012
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,900
that's for a reason that they do that so

1013
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,500
uh making like a warning about don't use

1014
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,200
this previous version for X and Y makes

1015
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,079
uh perfect sense to me

1016
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,280
um

1017
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,040
we have someone else in the queue makama

1018
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,780
that's me Mike Ackerman I have a

1019
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,760
question on the mechanisms and how they

1020
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,119
work when they're invoked do they always

1021
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,119
randomize All 48 bits or does that

1022
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,300
depend or is it controllable or is that

1023
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,859
a dumb question

1024
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,880
so I can start uh yeah I mean there

1025
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,339
there is different implementations I'll

1026
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,440
let Carlos get into the details I I can

1027
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,700
speak from the at least from the

1028
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,460
standard we a lot of our Network

1029
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,099
management tools like the vendor bits is

1030
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,839
there any way to freeze those so we can

1031
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,640
retain that and then still have privacy

1032
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,220
if we want and feel we need it so so

1033
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,460
there is I mean for sure uh there is the

1034
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,980
global and local bit that has to be uh

1035
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,780
respected right because otherwise you

1036
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,579
you have a global unique uh

1037
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:53,099
identification

1038
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,920
uh then moving on uh there are

1039
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,200
recommendations in NATO too about how to

1040
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,839
use and how to declare the rest of the

1041
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,660
the the bits uh there's a specification

1042
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,460
that talks about a quadrant where you

1043
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,619
can Define what type of randomization

1044
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,240
you're going to use and you can also

1045
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,060
request the specific uh organization

1046
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,160
identifiers but those are

1047
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,079
recommendations so so to answer your

1048
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,060
questions sounds like I need to read a

1049
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,000
nato2 doc yeah and and that doesn't mean

1050
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,800
that all implementations will follow the

1051
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,740
recommendation okay thank you good info

1052
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,260
yeah basically yeah

1053
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,540
there are as Juan Carlos said you can do

1054
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,240
different things and I guess your

1055
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,359
comment about keeping the kind of the

1056
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,940
ouai the the prefix on them randomize

1057
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,319
the second part is one of the quadrants

1058
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,660
that is defined so they typically Define

1059
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,640
a way of

1060
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,180
a structure in the the local space of

1061
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,800
Mac addresses so there is a bit for

1062
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,980
local and Global uh and in the local you

1063
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,380
can have this this quadrant so you play

1064
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,359
with two bits 25 with quadrant and one

1065
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,359
of them is basically uh specified to do

1066
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,040
what you mentioned well there are other

1067
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,780
approaches you can randomize the whole

1068
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,359
44 remaining bits you can do other

1069
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:07,800
things but one is exactly what you

1070
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,760
mentioned

1071
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,420
good explanation

1072
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,800
okay

1073
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,880
thanks for that

1074
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,079
so and my goal is gone but thanks also

1075
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,000
for volunteering to work on the on the

1076
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,079
BCP

1077
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,160
before disappearing

1078
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,859
exactly you went to start right

1079
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,240
so if there are no more questions then

1080
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,240
I'll move on to the next topic

1081
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,520
which is uh this open roaming experiment

1082
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,680
that we've been talking about uh with

1083
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,599
the WBA

1084
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,920
and as a reminder uh open roaming is uh

1085
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,280
if I simplify the for people that are

1086
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,140
familiar with eduron

1087
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,780
uh so at your room it's uh this

1088
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,280
infrastructure that allows people from

1089
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,780
different academic institutions to

1090
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,460
connect to the network and then we are

1091
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,260
we have enrolling it uh we have been

1092
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,619
working with ROM and uh connecting to

1093
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,720
other room for a while at the ietf so

1094
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,240
you you may have seen the this is ID and

1095
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,040
people that belong or have affiliation

1096
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,060
with some uh academic institution

1097
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,200
automatically can connect to to other

1098
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,680
ROM so open roaming expands that by

1099
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,500
using a pass Point uh from the Wi-Fi

1100
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,680
Alliance to allow not only one but

1101
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,680
multiple identity providers and there

1102
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,960
are a number of them these can be uh

1103
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,160
Cloud providers service providers

1104
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,500
corporations uh

1105
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,160
uh cellular companies that uh already

1106
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,859
have some sort of a relationship to a to

1107
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,560
a client and the idea is to allow

1108
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,500
different network infrastructure so or

1109
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,119
network uh

1110
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,720
infrastructure providers to uh

1111
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,000
authenticate with these multiple uh

1112
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,280
identity providers whenever a user

1113
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,180
arrives

1114
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,819
and we have the regionally brainstorm

1115
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:05,880
about doing something here in in London

1116
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,980
and just to give you an idea what we

1117
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,800
were originally planning to do was to

1118
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,040
run this experiment so that the users

1119
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,500
would arrive for instance in hidro and

1120
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,420
would automatically connect if they had

1121
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,760
already installed the profile

1122
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,619
on their devices and they could

1123
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,240
automatically connect to the hero

1124
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,520
Network or to the hydro Express train

1125
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,980
and then onto the the ietf of course to

1126
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,599
the ATF for people that have already

1127
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,339
attended one meeting they already have

1128
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:33,839
the credentials they can reconnect

1129
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,359
there's nothing new the new part would

1130
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,540
be the the open roaming uh to foreign

1131
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,220
networks that you have not visited but

1132
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,240
you can still uh authenticate to and uh

1133
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,579
so for different reasons uh this was not

1134
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,060
possible at uh in London uh there's

1135
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,280
multiple things that have to be put in

1136
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,619
place but we are still considering doing

1137
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,680
this experiment for uh upcoming meetings

1138
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,900
meaning Yokohama or San Francisco

1139
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,960
in which case uh we will let people know

1140
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,680
uh uh if if anyone is interested in

1141
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,060
participating in this experiment

1142
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,440
uh most likely it'll be required just to

1143
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,240
download a profile on the device and at

1144
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,700
that point uh people would agree to to

1145
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,520
join the experiment and would test on

1146
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,819
their devices about joining uh this open

1147
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:26,779
roaming experiment

1148
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,500
so

1149
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,400
um

1150
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,380
to give you an update about a little

1151
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,880
more details

1152
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,640
uh since we did not run the experiment

1153
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,260
at this time we we did do some steps

1154
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,960
towards uh future meetings so we had a

1155
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,780
technical meeting before ITF between WBA

1156
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,700
and the ITF knock specifically because

1157
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,859
they are the ones that run the the

1158
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,780
network for people that are not aware we

1159
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,260
have the network ratings center team at

1160
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,140
the ITF and they had to agree and look

1161
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,940
at all the details of any experiment

1162
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,800
that runs on the ITF Network as you know

1163
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,300
this is critical infrastructure for our

1164
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,240
meeting so we want to first most uh make

1165
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,880
sure that it doesn't endanger our our

1166
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,960
meetings

1167
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,240
so uh the different points that we need

1168
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,980
to solve is who would be the identity

1169
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,780
provider if ever we run this experiment

1170
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,240
or the identity providers

1171
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,339
uh that we preserve the user's privacy

1172
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:21,720
as we always do

1173
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,359
with the ietf attendees how we would

1174
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,700
provision devices meaning mobile phones

1175
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,319
or laptops with different operating

1176
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,960
systems what are the requirements on the

1177
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,420
network setup in this case ietf so that

1178
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,540
ietf becomes a

1179
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,800
infrastructure provider that connects to

1180
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,119
the Federation

1181
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,240
and the next steps are to run some

1182
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,780
scenarios test uh before and during the

1183
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,940
next ITF meeting and again if we believe

1184
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,579
it's a stable enough we will advertise

1185
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:53,900
and invite people to join

1186
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,160
are there any questions

1187
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,640
okay

1188
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,180
all right so

1189
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,619
next steps

1190
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,380
so we only have uh one last item which

1191
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,540
are the the next steps

1192
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,680
so uh

1193
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,960
in this case well the the idea uh with

1194
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,400
the IAD support is I think we we are

1195
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,680
kind of clear in the sense that we we

1196
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,380
have provided good guidelines to the

1197
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,400
authors of the two existing uh documents

1198
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,960
we had a big question marks about the

1199
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,700
BCP but I think we made some progress

1200
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,500
here and we even have some some

1201
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,980
volunteer to to start editing something

1202
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,140
which of course requires more more work

1203
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,859
on the on the use cases but otherwise I

1204
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:59,280
think the these immediate steps uh are

1205
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,940
uh what is needed Eric right I don't

1206
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,980
know if you see something else that we

1207
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,760
need to work on

1208
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,540
we take the mic for the giant uh

1209
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,640
anyway it's nice right now

1210
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,720
um yeah as you said we are basically

1211
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,640
arriving at the end of the Milestone I

1212
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,560
mean assuming the BCP is done within a

1213
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,119
year which I think is reasonable because

1214
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,260
we got already some basis and Michael

1215
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,520
will provide more

1216
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,859
and we may

1217
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,099
be our last but one know last but two uh

1218
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,619
madina's meeting and we declare success

1219
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,260
touching wood

1220
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,520
okay

1221
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,020
and thanks as well for the working group

1222
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,060
because you provided some feedback right

1223
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,319
to improve the document it's always

1224
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,900
interesting

1225
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,480
uh I have one one common question I

1226
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,839
think that as a potential neck has next

1227
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,940
actions so we have to of course provide

1228
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,559
an update on different documents

1229
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,359
following or getting into account the

1230
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,640
feedback but then maybe I would like to

1231
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,800
at least as a sort of one of the

1232
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,359
documents I will appreciate if we can

1233
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,760
get some volunteers to review the next

1234
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,740
iteration of the document

1235
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,800
before the next ITF meeting ibid so if

1236
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,660
we can provide the next iteration in

1237
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,540
like one or one and a half months time

1238
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,660
frame then getting some feedback will be

1239
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,618
very very useful

1240
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,020
yeah that's a good point and and in fact

1241
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,500
a couple of the questions that we heard

1242
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,599
it's uh part of the intention of these

1243
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,220
documents is precisely to answer those

1244
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,099
questions so so if if you are interested

1245
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,359
in this topic for instance the

1246
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,280
implementations on the operating systems

1247
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,280
so if you don't find the answer to your

1248
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,020
questions it's a super good information

1249
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,599
for the authors to to provide like okay

1250
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:51,180
well I would like to understand what is

1251
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,980
happening or what you are missing this

1252
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,220
reference or I don't I don't understand

1253
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,780
this part here of the of your document

1254
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,359
or the question about the the bits that

1255
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,700
are being randomized Etc so

1256
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,400
please take a look at the documents and

1257
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,720
provide your feedback that will be

1258
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,459
useful for the for the authors

1259
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,940
okay

1260
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,319
