meeting so we get a larger room next

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,160
time

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,380
uh before you come to the mic please

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,180
raise your hand so

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,140
okay welcome everyone to ATF 115 we are

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,300
so happy to see you in person

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,239
it's going to be a busy meeting please

9
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,940
be on time please respect time of others

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,739
and let us open the meeting

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,079
if you haven't read it before please

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,260
read not well by participating in ATF

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,379
you agree on everything that is defined

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,099
in BCPS and text below

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,860
IPR disclosures we've got a routing

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,039
working specific process we require you

17
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,780
to disclose APR before document get

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,540
adopted by the working group we require

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,200
you to declare IPR before document can

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,960
go in towards your plus call unless all

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,360
authors and contributors have

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,080
declared explicit their IPR document is

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,520
not going to progress

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,799
please make sure you do so

25
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,799
we haven't had any adopted working group

26
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,900
document between two atfs

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,880
existing documents the young crib

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,100
extended we closed working group loss

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,200
calls and Shepherd right up has been

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,360
uploaded so we are waiting for 80 to

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,619
review document

32
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,200
bgp Peak uh

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,700
commands yet to be addressed ATN bgp

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,960
there's some reviews been done it's a

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,979
long document

36
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,820
we expect to progress at some point and

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,320
there's also related routers are

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,939
probably since six men

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,060
TI LFA Stewart do you want to say a few

40
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,240
words

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,799
and thank you again for doing this

42
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,360
all right sir well I apologize to the

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,619
working group which has taken such a

44
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,900
long time to get there but had a very

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
productive meeting with the author team

46
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,060
before uh short earlier this afternoon

47
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,980
and I believe we've got a way forward

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,780
with the last remaining issues so

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,560
hopefully this will soon be with the isg

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,420
great and again thank you so much for

51
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,420
doing the work and I believe after the

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,760
upcoming update we are already

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,459
to progress with style faith

54
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,599
and Qs model will be updated today

55
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,879
so agenda for today I'm not going to

56
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,459
read it uh again we've got busy agenda

57
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,120
please be on time

58
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,780
agenda for tomorrow's meeting and we are

59
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,959
going to have guests uh

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,140
from sitcom we are going to get the best

61
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,040
paper award presentation and again busy

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,860
day

63
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,099
and we are ready for the presenter to

64
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,780
come uh please do take a look at Wiki we

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,420
are start to populate data there and all

66
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,480
additional information will be hosted in

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,840
Wiki

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,080
oops

69
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,480
okay so you'll be moving the slides

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,280
right okay

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,400
okay so hello everyone my uh name is

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,959
Asim Chaudhary

73
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
uh I will be providing updates on qscn

74
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,980
model

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,500
so in the uh latest version of the model

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,900
uh we have

77
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,260
added one more module uh which is Aina

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,780
cost types uh which contains uh uh all

79
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,000
the identities from the different cost

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,320
modules

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,418
so essentially what we are doing is that

82
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,220
we have taken the identities from the

83
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,280
cost modules and moved to the Ina cost

84
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,840
type module so that going forward uh we

85
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,360
don't have to change the cost modules

86
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,240
and we can simply change the Ina cost

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,120
type module uh which will be a much

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,880
simpler process

89
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,560
also in the uh last uh version of the

90
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,639
model

91
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,800
uh we had uh included

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,100
um operational model so in this version

93
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,979
of the model we have added the action

94
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,699
statement to clear the cost counters

95
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,560
we have also added the security

96
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,060
considerations

97
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,680
uh also uh there had been lot of uh

98
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,120
young doctor comments on uh regarding

99
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,300
the difference

100
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,759
filters and how they operate or connect

101
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,419
with each other we have given an example

102
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,460
in appendix T and in the next slide I

103
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,039
will be presenting or including uh how

104
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,440
they are correlated and will be pretty

105
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,500
clear from there uh that how the

106
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,020
different filter correlates with each

107
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,720
other uh to create classifiers and uh in

108
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,199
the policy model uh how the inline

109
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,100
filters are included uh to create the

110
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,580
policy

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,139
uh so also uh we have created a presence

112
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,240
container uh for inline classification

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,699
uh that has

114
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,639
helped to include the uh to get rid of

115
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,660
the line uh flag and has simplified the

116
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,000
model for us

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,300
uh in addition to that uh we have taken

118
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,360
care of numerous young doctor comments

119
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,139
and uh based on those modification we

120
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,580
are able to come up with the cost model

121
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,900
zero nine

122
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,560
next thing

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,539
so if we look into this particular

124
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,280
example uh it's example for classifiers

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,780
and the name of the classifier is my

126
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,240
classifier and this is a filter

127
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,000
operation match all now what does that

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
mean that means all the filters uh need

129
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
to be matching to the incoming packet uh

130
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,080
for the classified to be classified for

131
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,580
the packet to be classified under that

132
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,960
classifier

133
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,319
and so when I say match all that means

134
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,440
it will be matching all the filters and

135
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,919
if we say match any then any of the

136
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,759
filter matching uh to the packet will be

137
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,319
considered classified uh for the packet

138
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,500
uh so in this particular example uh if

139
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,780
we uh we can see that we have included

140
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,199
two filters uh one is of the type dscp

141
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,099
uh other is of the type Source port and

142
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,300
uh if we look into the dscp filter uh

143
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,900
there is a logical not as true what does

144
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,479
that mean that means that whatever

145
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,020
parameter which is defined under the uh

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,500
DHCP filter uh it will be the knot of

147
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,840
that so for example in this particular

148
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,460
example if the dscp value is 11 to 13

149
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,639
that means and The Logical not is true

150
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,940
that means 0 to 10 and the packet

151
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,900
incoming packet if it has dscp value 0

152
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,840
to 10 or 14 to 63 that in that case only

153
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,520
it will be matching to that particular

154
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,180
filter value uh if the logical not is

155
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,699
false the then it will be matching for

156
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,160
the value 11 to 13. okay

157
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,500
similarly for the source Port we have

158
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,259
multiple range values uh in this

159
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,180
particular example we have Source put

160
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,299
range from 10 000 to 10 300 and 17 500

161
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,099
to 90 800 that means incoming packet uh

162
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,279
if it has Source put range inside in

163
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
these two particular ranges then it will

164
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,160
be classified to that particular filter

165
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,860
so if we look overall classifier example

166
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,339
which we have presented here that means

167
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,519
an incoming packet which is coming

168
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,220
um has to match to all the filters which

169
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,040
are defined here and the source Port

170
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,320
value will must be in this particular

171
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,100
range and for DHCP value it will be the

172
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,680
reverse of the range uh now there had

173
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,399
been lot of confusion a lot of young dot

174
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,160
comments regarding this one uh we have

175
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,279
not only provided the text to clarify

176
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,060
this particular

177
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,519
details about the classification but

178
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,820
also provided this particular example

179
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,440
which will help to clarify or to

180
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,959
understand how the particular classifier

181
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,640
behaves

182
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,360
next slide

183
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,399
similarly this is policy configuration

184
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,220
example and in this particular example

185
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,240
the policy name is my policy and

186
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,660
um if we look further down it has an

187
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,360
inline container now that inline

188
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,779
container means that the configuration

189
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,100
parameter has to be defined in line uh

190
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,000
into the classifier itself now if we

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,680
look into the various vendor

192
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,560
implementations we will typically see

193
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,339
that a classifier has been defined as a

194
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,240
template or has been defined as inline

195
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,779
now it also depend on customer

196
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,080
requirements I have personally seen lot

197
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,180
of customer

198
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,580
who wants to segregate the

199
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,019
transportation into a separate

200
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,180
classifier and that way they are able to

201
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,220
segregate filters with the actions now

202
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,560
to typically the cost has much more

203
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,279
complicated actions and so they want to

204
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,399
segregate filters with the action and so

205
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,980
they Define the classifier as a separate

206
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,820
template but at the same time uh I have

207
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,220
seen a lot of customer who wants to

208
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,640
Define uh the classification parameter

209
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,740
as part of the in line into the policy

210
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,160
uh for them it's a simple mechanism to

211
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,339
configuration of a Qs policy so it may

212
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,740
depend on a customer requirement number

213
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,680
one number two also for vendors

214
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,500
typically they support one or two format

215
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,740
or even both uh but essentially if you

216
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,800
look into this example uh in this video

217
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,839
example the con the classification

218
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,079
parameter defined in line uh for the DSP

219
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,360
value which is in the range of 21 to 22

220
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,480
and if you look into the action uh it's

221
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,500
a marking down action from uh 2122 range

222
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,260
to 23 range to 23 value

223
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,820
so

224
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,180
and so for vendors to implement this uh

225
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,899
they may take this inline parameters and

226
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,540
convert into their internal template

227
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,800
implementation or they can if they have

228
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,380
a template configuration here instead of

229
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,160
inline and they are referring the

230
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,399
classifier uh as a template and if

231
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,980
vendors don't support that then they can

232
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,220
take the classifier template parameters

233
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,339
and convert into the inline uh in their

234
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,720
internal implementation

235
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,120
next thing

236
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,540
so uh essentially people are hoping that

237
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,200
we'll be uh able to cover all the young

238
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,100
doctor comments by this ITF but uh even

239
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,079
despite we working very very hard on

240
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,420
that we still have some comments to be

241
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,640
taken care of uh we are very very

242
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,760
hopeful that by next ITF will be able to

243
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,240
cover those

244
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,300
that's it

245
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,839
questions

246
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,060
okay so thank you for the products

247
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,800
really good work and we are getting

248
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,880
closer to working with classical

249
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
definitely yes yeah

250
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,399
thank you

251
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,860
foreign

252
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,540
I'm going to present a

253
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,500
Sr V6 pass equals protection

254
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
next page

255
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,240
first there was over document would like

256
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
to thank AC Peter Bruno

257
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279
eaming Jeff

258
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,779
Grace Alex

259
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,540
Kayton and Greek for their comment and

260
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,180
suggestions

261
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,200
one year ago

262
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,220
uh we present this document and ask for

263
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,320
working for the last call

264
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,560
but we are suggested to have

265
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,339
LSR working group to review this

266
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,720
document

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,139
so we presented this document in LSR

268
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:11,760
intermitting

269
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,320
and we get a comment there in addition

270
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,200
AC also carefully review the document

271
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,720
we've got available comments from AC

272
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,200
so in this current version we just all

273
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,260
the comments received uh basically we

274
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,860
remove one optional subtr V

275
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,279
under some editorial changes so that's

276
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,760
the main updates to this current version

277
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,040
so next page

278
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,279
so we would like to have ask for a

279
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,180
working

280
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,000
Math course any comments welcome thank

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,240
you

282
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,519
any questions comments

283
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,680
tomatoes go ahead

284
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,079
go ahead

285
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,040
um

286
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,079
since the contents of this draft

287
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,980
majority is LSR and spring related uh

288
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,899
and you said this has been reviewed in

289
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,620
NSR uh how about spring review has it

290
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,660
been reviewed there because it defines a

291
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
new uh behavior

292
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,519
for the mirror set

293
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,180
give me for the spring review so in fact

294
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,720
uh yeah you're right also I think I

295
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,940
remember you suggest we send that this

296
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,880
uh document to Spring proof or review

297
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,100
and as you suggested I send this

298
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,699
document to screen ask for for comments

299
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,779
a couple years ago

300
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,220
at least before the last call we still

301
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,620
need some feedbacks from Spring yeah

302
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,349
[Music]

303
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
let's try again try again okay I'll try

304
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,120
again okay yeah so actually there's a

305
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,639
couple of documents that kind of share

306
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,459
working groups or protection that

307
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,839
definitely belongs here while

308
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,540
encapsulation and Technology someplace

309
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,820
else and to

310
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,839
okay we I mean we will be talking to

311
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,720
Spring specifically to get more reviews

312
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,899
there and make sure that it can progress

313
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,720
here okay I'll try again okay so the the

314
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
next presentation is also covering the

315
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,979
same topic so

316
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,139
two uh two uh Eagle Productions in fact

317
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,320
a different one so maybe I just answer

318
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
a difference here just just answer some

319
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,019
questions maybe further so basically uh

320
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,019
okay okay

321
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,329
[Music]

322
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,760
so hello

323
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,579
hello ciao do you hear me

324
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,880
yes I can hear you and I passed the

325
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,100
control to you so you can control the

326
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,660
slide

327
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:36,860
uh okay so uh hello everyone

328
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,039
from Channel mobile I will present the

329
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,880
draft on behavior all the courses

330
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
so

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,039
it's a little bit

332
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,059
slow right

333
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,080
so ciao could you help me control the

334
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,500
uh at the bottom of your screen you have

335
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,679
yeah I see that but when I change that

336
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,340
how about it now it moves oh yeah it's

337
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,940
working okay thank you uh so the draft

338
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,600
introduced a very simple uh multi-home

339
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,799
protection

340
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,380
uh for the i76 uh I think it it's

341
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,480
different from uh the draft uh why not

342
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,900
just the present uh this is a uh on the

343
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,320
VPN library to provide

344
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,559
some protection solution so maybe quite

345
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,460
more will give more uh his understanding

346
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,059
yeah and the the basic

347
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,340
uh idea is that we introduced to new

348
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,200
item the first one is a

349
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,900
backup seat

350
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,679
which will be put on the top of the city

351
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,000
list

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,820
and the second item is a new flavor we

353
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,919
call that

354
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,299
Panama segment decapsulation liver which

355
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,240
indicated as are the sixth parameter

356
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,340
segment the capital lesion processing

357
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,120
uh the basic idea is that when the

358
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,520
parameter and the point receives the

359
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,900
packet and the fact that

360
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,780
it's not the Hope derived the neighbor

361
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:47,000
uh is the egress node and it's a

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,539
unreachable

363
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:53,900
then the parameter in the point will

364
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,520
direct the packet to the backup

365
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,419
node based on the backup sheet

366
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:04,380
uh

367
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,760
so

368
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,700
uh let's see the encapsulation of the

369
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,940
backup seat it will be put on top of the

370
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,980
seed list

371
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,840
and the

372
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,799
uh let's see the PSD flavor

373
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,179
I think

374
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:26,179
uh I I just have a message that

375
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,900
it will indicate the parameter segment

376
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,580
to remove the uh encapsulation

377
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,740
and then for the packet

378
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,860
to the uh

379
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,440
primary

380
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,299
note or the backup node

381
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:52,940
the flavor will be applied to some

382
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,380
represented such as the and Dot dt4 and

383
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,860
Dot DTS six and so on

384
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,679
uh we just needed some

385
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,460
uh minus engine to the

386
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,000
side the side to code

387
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,140
of the

388
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,340
Ice Age processing which defined the FC

389
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,559
8986

390
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,940
as shown in this page sub

391
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,960
uh condition will be added to

392
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,700
s02 line

393
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,820
so we also give an example

394
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,380
um

395
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,080
so uh the basic mechanism

396
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,059
at the Ingress node

397
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,159
uh

398
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,960
it will insert the backup seat on top of

399
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,659
the seed list

400
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,980
for the pandemic endpoint

401
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,980
one

402
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,120
at the normal condition

403
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,700
the traffic will be forwarded to the

404
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,080
primary egress node when the

405
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,500
uh primary egress note receiver said

406
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,280
with a PSD flavor

407
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,880
it will remove the encapsulation of the

408
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,000
packet and forward the packet according

409
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,480
to the payload

410
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,640
packet height

411
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,600
and if the pandemic and the point

412
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,520
the primary U.S node is unreachable it

413
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
will modify the

414
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,720
uh destination address of the packet

415
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,539
to the backup seat directly then the

416
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,900
traffic will be forwarded to the backup

417
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,520
node so the multi-homing

418
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,059
protection will be achieved

419
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,260
so here is the example

420
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,600
we will ignore that

421
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,720
and uh

422
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,260
compared to the previous version is

423
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,340
instructor we introduce the

424
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,500
PSD flavor

425
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,580
uh to

426
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,900
uh

427
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,340
indicate

428
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,460
uh the

429
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,980
uh

430
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,500
not made segment

431
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,400
uh to remove the encapsulation directly

432
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,980
and we also

433
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,360
changes the position of the backup seat

434
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,320
instead of the bottom of the seed list

435
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,740
in this version we put it on the top of

436
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,900
the zip list

437
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,539
so uh that's all in the any comments or

438
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,780
questions

439
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,720
yeah

440
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,760
Darren Dukes from Cisco Systems

441
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,940
um I hadn't seen the PSD Sid uh

442
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,419
discussed in Spring at all have you have

443
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,100
you discussed that there I might have

444
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,459
missed it

445
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,159
oh uh so this is a good question thank

446
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,059
you darling I think

447
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:42,240
we just the president has a draft in uh

448
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,179
RTG working group at this moment I think

449
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,380
if uh it's necessary of course it's

450
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,380
needed we should

451
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,679
maybe present to the draft in the spring

452
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,059
also

453
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,520
yeah sure just and and also just uh I

454
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
mean you could alert spring event at any

455
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
time to send an email uh because I think

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,159
we should probably talk about the impact

457
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,840
of that sit type

458
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,000
thanks okay we will

459
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,860
yeah

460
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,600
so I just want to explain the difference

461
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,600
between the two equal protections

462
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,020
so this one my answer is that this is a

463
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,400
for VPN some kind of surface protection

464
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,460
so in order to provide this uh equals

465
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,120
protection so on the backup equation

466
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,279
node we need a configure

467
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,360
the backup seat so that backup seat sell

468
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,620
the same space

469
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,860
in the back cover note right and then

470
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,700
the behavior of that state should be

471
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,360
mirror or stem or similar to the seat on

472
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,700
the on the primary equation node

473
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,779
so

474
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,299
under this condition

475
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,820
at the English node and then we can put

476
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,260
another back up seed as the last seed in

477
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,559
the city list and then we can achieve

478
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,559
the equals

479
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,220
the

480
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,779
node protection

481
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,200
so our approach is that

482
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,080
so our you can you could production is a

483
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,299
normal equals protection

484
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,679
so all the seeds on the primary equation

485
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,700
node

486
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,380
so we don't need a configuration on the

487
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,020
bicar for the equation node so we use a

488
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,039
mirror sheet as a context and then all

489
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,740
the behavior of that seed on the primary

490
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,340
equals node we just Barrel to the

491
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,100
context node of a primer node and then

492
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,159
we use data table to forward

493
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,020
uh for the

494
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,100
the package to the destinations so that

495
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,620
means it's so it's different from

496
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,039
different approaches why is this focus

497
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,320
on Surface and why is for normal

498
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,100
protections

499
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,980
okay

500
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,559
thank you one more uh I I think in uh

501
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,279
yes the post draft is different I think

502
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,520
it solves a different problem uh answers

503
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,200
deep in the library so thank you

504
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,000
run

505
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,720
run user

506
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,559
can you hear me now yes

507
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,900
I have a few comments on this work

508
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,120
first it's laudable

509
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,900
um

510
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,020
it is a a problem that needs to be

511
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,799
solved but there were a few impediments

512
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,020
first along with bringing it to Spring

513
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,360
you probably should bring it to six man

514
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,960
because it changes the semantic of the

515
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,600
SRH

516
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,340
um second

517
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,679
it does change the meaning of fields in

518
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,419
the routing header

519
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,419
how do you intend to maintain backwards

520
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,760
compatibility in in light of that

521
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,320
uh okay so thank you rob uh yeah uh

522
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,740
firstly I I think I agree with you we're

523
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,120
not only needed to uh ask for the

524
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,360
comments from the spring we also need to

525
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,679
do the same thing in the

526
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,460
sixth my working group

527
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,860
uh and the the second question I think

528
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,720
uh the current

529
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,400
uh

530
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,400
solution uh is a compatible with the

531
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,299
sih processing

532
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:02,940
rules I

533
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,840
don't think we introduced some new but

534
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,799
anyway we should

535
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,779
the semantics of segments left and last

536
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,039
entry

537
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:19,260
oh uh yeah yeah correct uh we introduced

538
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,760
a new flavor for that I think it uh

539
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,000
maybe the flavor

540
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,679
uh

541
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,919
can can be used at that uh

542
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,220
scenario right because the fever can

543
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,120
indicate the different

544
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,340
and finally one more question how does

545
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,480
this interact with the season

546
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,640
hello

547
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,380
yes one final question how does this

548
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,700
interact with Seaside

549
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,980
can you hear me

550
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,419
can you hear me

551
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,279
no avail of the presenter will give an

552
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,740
admin to reconnect and otherwise we'll

553
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,020
take all the questions to the list okay

554
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,880
and obviously this needs to be discussed

555
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,919
in six men and spring

556
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,360
let's do the next one yeah

557
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,480
so if your connect will try to to do

558
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,179
this if time allows

559
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,880
hello Jazz could you hear me

560
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,880
yep so last question from Ron was how

561
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,700
does it interact with ccit

562
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,179
okay

563
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,480
I I just was lost due to the banned

564
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,260
Network

565
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,740
uh I did not hear the question from raw

566
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,500
the last question I did not hear

567
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
the last question is how does this

568
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,240
interact with c-seed

569
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,260
uh I think uh

570
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,140
this moment

571
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,039
uh you know the CC the draft can support

572
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,340
the mixed uh

573
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,140
comprise the seed and as a normal seed

574
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,760
uh you know this flavor just uh for the

575
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,820
uh

576
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,659
vaping seed so when we keep the VPN

577
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:12,260
seated as a normal seed there's no any

578
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,980
other

579
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,200
uh problem

580
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,799
so I think it's com compatible with a cc

581
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:22,100
truck

582
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,080
Ron does it answer a question

583
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:35,100
not probably a better brain yeah yeah I

584
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,480
think it might require a little more

585
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,960
discussion

586
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,460
yeah I definitely have some discussion

587
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,159
uh kitten maybe after the meeting we

588
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,279
can't do more uh detailed discussion

589
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,140
yeah please occur all right

590
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,700
I had actually a question on slide

591
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,039
number six if somebody could bring that

592
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,179
up please

593
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,720
uh

594
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:08,580
this slide talks about uh yeah this

595
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,520
slide talks about penultimate uh node

596
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,799
now when you say penultimate here in

597
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,000
this example uh the SRH has A2 colon

598
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,840
colon 1. so did you mean the penultimate

599
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,940
endpoint because that could be several

600
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,200
hops away

601
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,980
or it could even be the Ingress P when

602
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,880
there is no SRH right so how does this

603
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,880
work uh how does this egress protection

604
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,120
mechanism work when the penultimate

605
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,360
segment endpoint is several hops away

606
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,980
uh so uh we have a uh the flavor

607
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,960
uh PSD here right when the uh load the

608
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,940
P2

609
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,059
received a seat with uh so let me let me

610
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,820
sorry let me interrupt that assume that

611
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,940
the SRH does not have a two colon colon

612
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,200
1 in this example

613
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:11,820
how does egress Protection work in that

614
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,560
case

615
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,699
sorry let me see I I do assume that yeah

616
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,099
yeah correct

617
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,280
so assume that the penultimate uh

618
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,520
segment endpoint was uh A1 colon colon

619
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,359
I mean P1

620
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,239
the P1 router is the penultimate yes it

621
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,399
can be right

622
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,599
yeah

623
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,580
uh yeah you are correct

624
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,099
yeah yeah so thank you we wish you the

625
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,940
correct okay so a second so please see

626
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,859
or work out how this works second thing

627
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:50,659
is

628
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,199
uh how does uh okay let's say it is P2

629
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,560
and it detects that P1 node P3 node is

630
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,400
down

631
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,119
right uh now P3 node is down uh how does

632
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,540
it know that that particular Behavior

633
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,040
uh was an N dot uh DT uh with PSD

634
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,480
because pe3 is in the overlay but P2 is

635
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,260
a underlay node how would it learn that

636
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,160
the next seed is now this flavor and

637
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,200
that it should do this you know funky

638
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,560
Behavior to uh you know Bypass or skip

639
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,200
that hop and go to the next one

640
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,180
with all the encapsulation and all of

641
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,160
these things so

642
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,040
how would it know

643
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,480
uh yum meaning uh how P2 no right how

644
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,599
how does how does P2 know about the

645
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,599
overlay said which is this n dot DT with

646
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,660
PSD how does it know about that number

647
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,540
one and how does it know that

648
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,540
that PSD is the behavior associated with

649
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,339
that said when it arrives at P2

650
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:26,339
no

651
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,000
yes I I meant a failure condition I

652
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,900
meant a failure condition

653
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,980
yeah it could be it could also be it

654
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,440
could also be a yeah but it could also

655
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,000
be

656
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,260
true but then

657
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,140
okay

658
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,820
okay so this is assuming this is this is

659
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,560
assuming that this

660
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,540
okay I think in the interest of time we

661
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,220
are going in rounds and yeah

662
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,900
please send your questions to the list

663
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,400
and

664
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,720
we'll take it from there

665
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,280
okay so thank you thank you chairs to

666
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,380
all the authors of the draft please make

667
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,960
it a priority to answer because you

668
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,200
actually didn't provide any answers

669
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,740
okay

670
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,579
I presented foreign

671
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,579
so I'm going to present a Sr physics

672
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,020
midpoint protection

673
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,359
next page

674
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,520
first of all we thank all

675
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,880
will give us a comments and suggestions

676
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,579
so I suggested we

677
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,140
present

678
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,700
this draft

679
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,800
in the spring group

680
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,099
and the way I will also the

681
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,780
initiate the discussions

682
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,619
in six month mainly needs

683
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,720
so basically we focus on

684
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,800
transun node as a Repel node

685
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,560
which cannot change a second loading

686
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,760
header

687
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,119
so originally in a document we have a

688
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,980
section

689
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,160
to talk about a transient node as a

690
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,480
Repel node

691
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,060
so in fact this is not

692
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,990
in complying with the RFC

693
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,320
[Music]

694
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,200
8200

695
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,460
so we address that we remove this

696
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,780
section

697
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,480
trying to node as a repair node you know

698
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,980
in our draft

699
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,960
and now we also address all the other

700
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,960
comments

701
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,480
so in the current uh

702
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,280
version of the draft

703
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,020
I think we are

704
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,839
ready for adoption

705
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:43,940
so because

706
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,420
this one is also experimental so

707
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,820
next page

708
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,119
so we would like request for adoptions

709
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,460
so any comments

710
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,520
have you confirmed that your changes are

711
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,940
acceptable for spring and six men

712
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,980
yeah I think so I think in the Middle

713
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,460
East we

714
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,500
these are the trying to know there's a

715
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,640
repair node so right now only endpoint

716
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,900
node

717
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,359
can change

718
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,859
simran had basically changed the

719
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,480
destination

720
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,900
so the those one violet

721
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,220
all the packet is encrypt uh is uh you

722
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,680
have an extra layer of encapsulation or

723
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,380
you actually the SRI header is now clear

724
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,880
no not to change the SR SRH header just

725
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,579
change the second left

726
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:44,339
this one right now because we have a

727
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:46,320
segment list

728
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,540
so when one node fails so the under

729
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,119
pointer node

730
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,560
abstract and anywhere

731
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,579
so in private hope and then that node

732
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:01,200
nodes or this one failed not reachable

733
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,900
we just pop up that one

734
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,720
the document that the segment left and

735
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,760
then we go to the left next one right so

736
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,800
there's a very simple change there's no

737
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,560
no is not finite uh RFC 8200 is simple

738
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,859
change it's almost the same as uh

739
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,660
same routing behavior is same as a

740
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,240
second round behaviors so trans just now

741
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,000
in at the end point originally we have

742
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,300
also we have a protection on the under

743
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
Point node also

744
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,339
transfer node so just try to notify that

745
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:40,079
the RFC 8200 so we will remove that one

746
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,200
if you only decrement the point of what

747
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,419
if there are it's gonna cause loops

748
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,700
only have the next half right you

749
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,760
actually skip the failed one you go to

750
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,619
the next one directly

751
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,560
but you cannot uh guarantee there is no

752
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,900
Loop well that one yeah that's a good

753
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,859
question

754
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,740
so in fact that's the after IDP

755
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,020
convergence after igb conversion

756
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,040
conversion so we use a DOTA we use the

757
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,980
endpoint under Point seats

758
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,040
so we go go along the shorter path of

759
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,820
igp after IDP convergence right so

760
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,640
that's the solution so the student have

761
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,200
a loop because I have like igb

762
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,480
convergence that it works a GP converts

763
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,060
is slow there's significant Delta in

764
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,640
time where you have failed linked to the

765
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
next hub but your igp hasn't converged

766
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,240
yet right so uh basically this solution

767
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,000
have two two stages

768
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,839
one stage is that before IDP convergence

769
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,160
so before igp converges and then the

770
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,760
package will deliver to the adjacent

771
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,119
node of data fail node right because

772
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,680
why not failed

773
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,460
igp is not converging so the 14 table on

774
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,220
Evernote still think that node is not

775
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,700
failed right only the Json node node

776
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,700
that's not failed because it has a PFD

777
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,079
detection whatever Fast Direct

778
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,440
detections so that adjacent node will do

779
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,520
TI LFA whatever frr so that data

780
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,920
education node

781
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,660
fastfully detect the failure of that guy

782
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,819
and then get around that failed note

783
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,579
such as before igb convergence so after

784
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,500
the IDP converge

785
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,880
then Evernote knows or that guy is died

786
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,180
so the remote node will know I cannot

787
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,280
reach that failed node so in this case

788
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,220
this second stage

789
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,220
the endpoint node will

790
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,160
pop up at a further node see the seat of

791
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,359
that fair node

792
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,140
using and then the last seat

793
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,319
that's opposite of along the along the

794
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,380
Sr pass so that one right now is

795
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,780
converged shortest path and then you

796
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,599
know there's no dope right so at a

797
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,819
certain stage so your assuming field be

798
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:13,140
preempting uh tlfa and local not by

799
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,440
changing the list on not before not

800
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,480
changing the list just pop yeah I

801
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,619
understand yeah

802
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,960
yeah I couldn't put my hand up on the

803
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,099
tool because the Network's not working

804
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,599
in here for me right now but during Duke

805
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,040
Cisco Systems

806
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,839
um I don't think that

807
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,599
particular change was discussed on any

808
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:31,920
mailing list because if you say you're

809
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,000
just gonna

810
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,680
ignore the next segment and decrement

811
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,420
segment list without carrying what it

812
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,220
was you're just going to break it you

813
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,619
can't do that

814
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,420
I think there's a we send it to the

815
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,819
sixth amendment list and then we have a

816
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,700
discussion recorder I can send to you

817
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,099
yeah that that aspect

818
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,859
okay yeah send it out very clearly and

819
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,400
I'll requests

820
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,920
of this document that collect a lot of a

821
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,180
record of a wedding list yeah so uh you

822
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,460
the update is a draft and you assume

823
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,960
that the update has addressed the

824
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,359
commands right but you actually didn't

825
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,640
get any confirmations that people are

826
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,680
happy with new changes right so I would

827
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,440
really advise you to send another email

828
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,380
to spring with the updated version of

829
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,480
the draft and explicitly ask whether

830
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,579
people are okay with it okay and then we

831
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,660
can talk about adoption okay thank you

832
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,579
again okay to see whether further

833
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,740
comments okay thank you

834
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,439
then you won't ask no question

835
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,619
again it's kind of the same first

836
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,900
question that I asked previously uh

837
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,839
there seems to be an assumption that uh

838
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,500
with srv6 that the penultimate or the

839
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,960
previous segment uh endpoint node is

840
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,900
directly connected to the next segment

841
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,960
endpoint node so that it can detect you

842
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,960
know a failure as a in a tlfa or a local

843
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,140
thing this is probably not going to be

844
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,060
all always the case

845
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,520
so

846
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,760
uh I mean I I'm really wondering how uh

847
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,920
practical or useful this is

848
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,859
or if it is only applicable for a hub by

849
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:22,140
hop kind of uh path right uh

850
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,099
so we're cut into your question so this

851
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,200
is not assume

852
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,520
the

853
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,640
the note is I mean the endpoint node is

854
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,160
a directly connected to fill the note

855
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,800
so this is a draft

856
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,060
is a law

857
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,280
node and the pointer node

858
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,859
is the upper string of the filter node

859
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:49,500
can be multiple by way

860
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,119
it can be

861
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,579
the endpoint node directly connects the

862
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:57,599
fair node that's okay it also allow

863
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,420
the endpoint node which is the upper

864
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,460
string of the field node of multiple

865
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,339
away both case is covered

866
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:17,160
so your assumption is that every not

867
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,140
participation igp will flood update

868
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,260
information and denote that is the

869
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,480
previous Hub in the list will react

870
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,140
accordingly yeah the difference so

871
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,720
is the case whether

872
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,220
in case of

873
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,740
the node and the pointer node Direct

874
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,440
Connect it's just a fair note

875
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,700
also the Enterprise node is away to the

876
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,760
fair note those are work because the

877
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,040
independent node after igp convergence

878
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,540
knows that I cannot reach the further

879
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,859
node right

880
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,900
because that note is done I did be

881
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,099
converged

882
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,680
after this and the pointer note notes

883
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,859
that I cannot reach the third note I

884
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:02,940
will

885
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,300
put half the seat for that fail to note

886
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,660
and then the likes the next seat

887
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,480
will be the first at the top of the stem

888
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,700
list right and then we'll forward the

889
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,720
traffic to the last seat

890
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,540
using sorted paths after IDP converged

891
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,579
so it's okay right

892
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:26,579
whatever

893
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,560
right

894
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,660
as Darren suggested this Behavior needs

895
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,640
to be discussed in Spring yeah we can

896
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,560
discussion no problem we can discuss the

897
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,260
whatever issue you can come up or reach

898
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,000
you can resolve it just a short

899
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
follow-up form or whatever you discussed

900
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,800
it would be good if you would put it in

901
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,839
the draft before you send it out for him

902
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,000
so this way people have the right

903
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
expectation on what kind of uh how fast

904
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,780
the uh protection mechanism works

905
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,880
yeah I think this idea also will present

906
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,220
in the NASA ITF we have a picture there

907
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,560
and then these two cases that I present

908
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,980
there are you know because that's it

909
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,500
will print in the spring and then after

910
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,480
that prison here

911
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,579
somewhere as your question can present

912
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,680
again in the spring whatever the more

913
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,180
comments that's okay

914
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,819
so you have updated the draft and you

915
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,859
significantly changed the logic right no

916
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,859
no no not significant just remove this

917
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,380
transgender node as a Repel node which

918
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,079
is significant change so again without

919
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,079
going around please do address the

920
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,780
comments please uh have a discussion

921
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,800
spring contestment

922
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,760
thank you

923
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,920
Robin is going to present in three

924
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,460
months all right

925
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,720
hello hello everyone this is

926
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:16,220
the generalized IPv6 tunnel okay next

927
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,800
so while we need the Gip uh generalize

928
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,440
the IPv6 tunnel because countries there

929
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,160
are many types of internals such as you

930
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,619
can see the list in the labsible

931
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:35,700
how to tt3 like yourself Electro and the

932
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,460
on IPv6 Network it's hard to Define

933
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,280
extensions or for all the all these

934
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,540
tunnels to support the new features

935
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,400
it's not recommended to attention new

936
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,000
features but it's the ipv4 this plan for

937
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,119
the tunnels new features

938
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,280
such as the

939
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,420
API and the alternate mapping and our

940
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,579
ammu

941
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:04,819
okay next

942
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,119
so what's the challenge

943
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,640
need to be supporting new features such

944
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,559
as the last the previous before and so

945
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,720
the following problem will be existing

946
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,260
first there is a lot of standard worker

947
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,480
I'll add all of the IP tunnels mentioned

948
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,839
about mutualism

949
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:29,579
accordingly resulting a lot of standard

950
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:32,700
work and the second is hard to keep the

951
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,059
consistent because between the IPv6 and

952
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,240
ipv4 for this opportunity since the

953
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,880
possible extensions are recommended to

954
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,900
be only on the IPv6 so you can't

955
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,599
um it kind of keeps the consistency and

956
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:51,420
so there is a function reduction ibv6

957
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,000
can directly support some functions of

958
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,059
these articles which can't be done with

959
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,700
a pv4 and this means some function

960
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,180
becomes reduction over the rtv6 for

961
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,240
example we we as line takes use of the

962
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,080
UDT to do the USM key but

963
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,160
[Music]

964
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,740
in the IPv6 header also can be used to

965
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,859
support the same key and of course the

966
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,780
zip code to extension based on the

967
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,420
existing format some actually tunnels

968
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,119
such as

969
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:29,880
have their own headers if these tunnels

970
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,040
need to support new features over the

971
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,859
ip6 they will they will face the

972
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:37,619
challenge of the choice between reducing

973
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,920
the IP resistance

974
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,900
IPv6 information for this in future

975
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,380
based on the IPv6 extension header and

976
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,440
Define a new extension based on their

977
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,000
own header so they have two problems the

978
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,300
first is if the tonal header extended it

979
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,119
will be returning with the execution

980
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,280
IPv6 in Evolution for the new feature is

981
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,400
on the ipv63 header and the second is

982
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,700
for some existing funnels as a tune to

983
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,640
have their own other so they have to use

984
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,940
the IPv6 in calculation for these new

985
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,760
features based on IPv6 header so

986
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,460
extensions need to be redefined in the

987
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,099
IPv6 extension header as a result the

988
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,339
extension May differ from that of the IP

989
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,640
tunnels which have their own header okay

990
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,000
next

991
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,140
so we Define we defined a new tunnels

992
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,980
called the generalized IPv6 tonal and

993
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,920
the tunnel is defined to use the IPv6

994
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,339
header and rb6 extension handle to sort

995
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,859
both acquisition applications function

996
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,839
and the new features

997
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,480
under the

998
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,520
cavaliation completely the party has the

999
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,480
following format okay with any V6 header

1000
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,099
and ipv16 extensions next is the pillow

1001
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:06,540
the option below the packaging this is

1002
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,940
option one and the next option two is

1003
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,520
the IPv6 header and IPv6 extension

1004
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,520
is

1005
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:22,640
okay that's what

1006
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:30,300
the function of the UDP is replaced by

1007
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,040
the flow label of the IPv6 header in the

1008
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,680
grp6 tunnel to ensure capability the

1009
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,559
value of the flow level cap calculated

1010
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,339
for the powers of zmp should be the same

1011
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:47,700
as that of the source Port of UDP

1012
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,760
until the definition of the main option

1013
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,599
is defined and this

1014
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,300
includes the big Baseline had the

1015
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,680
information and the option must only

1016
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,359
encapsulate in the destination option

1017
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,779
header

1018
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,700
okay for people it's also an example and

1019
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,480
we Define a new Peak header and the

1020
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,460
quicker also to Define to cover the

1021
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,380
quick credit information the quick

1022
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:24,000
option and also you uh also include in

1023
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,940
capitalizes in the destination options

1024
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,380
header okay

1025
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,440
okay and uh for I'm here so we just use

1026
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,160
give a use case used for the

1027
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:42,319
ipv jp6 for MPS next

1028
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:47,420
and what's the challenge is is

1029
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,760
helpful challenges first the MPS is the

1030
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,119
lack of the source and indication and

1031
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:57,839
the MP 2p connection may occur so this

1032
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,059
will cause the difficult and the

1033
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,680
compliance when process is

1034
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,640
also SFL is defined but there is a few

1035
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,240
in position and the second is the pillow

1036
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,180
type can't be directly and determined

1037
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,680
because there is no pillow the

1038
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,579
indication

1039
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,300
and third there's no medita

1040
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,859
extensibility and distributed to

1041
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:25,319
encapsulate the new sodium attributes

1042
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,780
for the new future

1043
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,760
such as a feature selection and APN Etc

1044
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,619
unfold is the process of it it's a p

1045
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:37,740
function is complex complex and the

1046
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,559
vasopodium performance intro pay level

1047
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,420
is used for the example at the bottom of

1048
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,880
the legal stance so we

1049
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,980
information how to be passed for the

1050
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,020
purpose of the SMP

1051
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,440
and that's

1052
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,200
so when you use the grp6 tunnel for an

1053
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,960
foreign

1054
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,020
we can

1055
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,720
have the volume

1056
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,819
the first is

1057
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:14,760
social address can be used to form a

1058
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,220
source identification and the next is

1059
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:22,140
the IPv6 Network header can increase the

1060
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,160
payload time and third is the IPv6 flow

1061
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,260
labels can you can be used to

1062
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,740
implementing the gsmp and of course the

1063
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,720
encapsulation for the new future

1064
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,920
defined well in IPv6 and can be used

1065
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,859
okay that's what is the format

1066
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:46,578
okay next

1067
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,420
okay

1068
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,579
so we have two type of Ms idea and here

1069
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:54,980
is the

1070
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,140
faster and faster we have two actions

1071
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,440
one is to pop and one swap it would pop

1072
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,400
up with just the shift the uh the

1073
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,079
picture open that

1074
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,020
underfo the tab two I'm here uh see them

1075
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:17,280
and we use the IPv6 using Hydra and so

1076
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,619
use the Lego stack also we Define the

1077
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:24,619
procedure it depends to home house

1078
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:28,500
multiple labels in composition the phone

1079
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:34,260
this is also the same as and the type 2

1080
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,780
is used as a segment as a June header

1081
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,540
after all the label in pollution in the

1082
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,900
IPv6 definition address are housing so

1083
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,460
maybe it's the first label interpolation

1084
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,480
in the second indicates uh SL of the IH

1085
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,160
will be processed something else

1086
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:55,920
so uh also have some control plan

1087
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,880
consideration the first is

1088
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,980
exiting uh I'm Health control plan

1089
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,280
doesn't need to be changed so I'm has a

1090
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,799
label on the control plan can still be

1091
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:13,619
destroyed for IPv6 I believe four and R2

1092
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:16,220
next

1093
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,520
okay so let's use some requirements of

1094
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,559
the grpv6 terminal

1095
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,260
and Suppose there had two problems the

1096
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,599
con firstly is the country many new

1097
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,760
features I imagine and the cost between

1098
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,599
interpolation over the IPv6 and has

1099
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,660
defined and the second is in the process

1100
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,000
of deployment of this new future

1101
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,299
because Network demands have different

1102
00:59:44,299 --> 00:59:47,940
capabilities of Apex detention header so

1103
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,839
the following issue maybe

1104
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:54,839
okay maybe you can you can check this

1105
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:56,119
okay

1106
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:59,220
so we have some some new comments the

1107
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,780
first is the way to advertise the

1108
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,640
community

1109
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,180
and maybe uh the uh two different ways

1110
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,680
one is use the RDP sphere and the next

1111
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,740
is use the controller so PCS and the

1112
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,960
next time young may be used and the

1113
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,599
interest we mean so the paths can of

1114
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:23,160
course most to me so we we this time we

1115
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,640
can use a TPU to support this you know

1116
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,000
it's Neo and the TCP or if

1117
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,040
and that's

1118
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,520
exactly okay

1119
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,579
and the company about the ability is

1120
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:40,220
essentially

1121
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,859
and the community option of the header

1122
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:47,240
also we need to send it

1123
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,819
and the the last thing is the completed

1124
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:53,640
about the specific future and like a

1125
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:58,319
solution out or alternate marking is

1126
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,119
okay

1127
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,160
okay that's all uh comments are welcome

1128
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,599
thank you

1129
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,640
Greg

1130
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,099
um Greg musky Erickson

1131
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,540
um well thank you for sharing your

1132
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,220
imagination

1133
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,220
um

1134
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,920
I have a question so um

1135
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,920
are you aware of the work on mpls

1136
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,880
network actions to uh extend uh mpls

1137
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,540
architecture

1138
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,059
and you mean the extension I mean us

1139
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:33,119
it's not extension it's called mpls

1140
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,079
Network actions

1141
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:40,680
I I'm not I'm not on not uh don't just

1142
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,339
do that okay I'll encourage you uh to

1143
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:48,660
check uh the work of mpls files and that

1144
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,420
uh user uh working groups

1145
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,299
and the documents they adopted already

1146
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:57,359
and not to duplicate it elsewhere yeah

1147
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,460
but I think I think that that is not

1148
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,680
conflict

1149
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,480
uh since you are not aware of this work

1150
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,059
I don't think that you can really uh

1151
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,760
compare your proposals and what the

1152
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,220
community is working on for some time

1153
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,260
okay

1154
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,059
so uh I don't think that what you are

1155
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,839
proposing uh really is uh required thank

1156
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:19,680
you

1157
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,220
foreign

1158
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,780
Duke Cisco Systems um this one's maybe

1159
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,119
maybe more for the working group chairs

1160
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:33,299
this uh this draft is defining a bunch

1161
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:35,640
of new tunnel encapsulations is this the

1162
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,500
right location for this type of work

1163
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,740
yeah so there's a set of requirements

1164
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,660
and usually requirements are there

1165
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,359
because someone requires them I'm yet to

1166
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,640
hear from NVR people they are unhappy

1167
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,160
with the transports layer used for

1168
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,740
uh loud sharing or load balancing it's

1169
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,480
you know there are billions of endpoints

1170
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,119
during the summer ip6 today and they're

1171
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:01,740
using UDP

1172
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,660
so the cost of implementation what

1173
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,280
you're proposing is enormous and

1174
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,500
benefits are absolutely clear whole use

1175
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,660
of flow level for load sharing is you

1176
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,099
know toxic topic

1177
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:14,520
so in general I mean I understand what

1178
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,020
you're trying to do I'm not sure

1179
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,460
industry needs it and

1180
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,140
and you definitely need to go to all the

1181
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,859
stakeholders start with mpls and nvo and

1182
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:28,559
tell them what you are doing and here's

1183
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,480
their reaction to it if they don't need

1184
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,079
it maybe you shouldn't be doing it

1185
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,520
we can discuss later

1186
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,380
I think there's a

1187
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,299
what people I see

1188
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,660
the long road to the mic AC land of

1189
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,540
Cisco Systems I think this is

1190
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,280
interesting that you've taken like a

1191
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,960
green field and mapped all these

1192
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,160
existing uh end caps to IPv6 around

1193
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,599
hampers and it was a nice it's a nice

1194
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:08,760
exercise it would be a nice

1195
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,700
like research paper but given how long

1196
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,619
all these things have evolved and been

1197
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:15,780
deployed and where they are it's

1198
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,559
something

1199
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,260
I mean it'll never see the light of day

1200
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,359
I can tell you that right now so you're

1201
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,480
just spending a lot of time especially

1202
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,040
with the scope

1203
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,920
you know it might

1204
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,740
be if if you hadn't I'm not saying you

1205
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,839
do but if you had an end cap

1206
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,380
that tried to replace those that would

1207
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,799
be one rather than mapping every one of

1208
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:41,880
them and you still have all the

1209
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,079
different cases because you really

1210
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,400
haven't gotten rid of you know you

1211
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,380
haven't got rid of uh genev or mpls or

1212
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,299
anything else you just mapped them and

1213
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:54,059
it's you know like I said well it's kind

1214
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,380
of nice to do a green field it's not

1215
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,880
it's just never going to happen

1216
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,119
okay I think the advantage for this

1217
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:03,720
methadone we maybe the even we have also

1218
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,980
have money

1219
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,619
harder to do

1220
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,900
the harder the format may be at the same

1221
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,819
format

1222
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:14,640
the three phrase is see you know if you

1223
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,559
would have focused on completely new use

1224
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,339
cases maybe there's a value but looking

1225
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:22,319
at what you're trying to do is just

1226
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:25,400
ocean boiling exercise

1227
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:33,740
okay well done right yeah thank you

1228
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,980
Mike

1229
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,540
okay

1230
01:05:57,299 --> 01:06:00,240
so if AC thinks the previous draft will

1231
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,500
never see the light of day he's gonna

1232
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,720
love this one so

1233
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,440
um

1234
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,839
this trap is a little bit uh unique in

1235
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,579
that we're not proposing anything we're

1236
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:11,700
simply giving a summary of what we've

1237
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,619
seen being proposed out in the industry

1238
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:16,920
the authors we were involved in the iic

1239
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,319
and a little bit of some of the IEEE

1240
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:21,420
groups that are working on blockchain

1241
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,599
with regards to iot and governance and

1242
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,880
so um and we presented here previously

1243
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,180
on the impact of dlts on the network

1244
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,160
and some measurements and testing we've

1245
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,480
done so this is kind of just an

1246
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,059
evolution that we've had it's probably

1247
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:38,579
too experimental and forward-thinking

1248
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,720
for IDR Sue and um insiders so we're

1249
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,400
just going to start here and see and see

1250
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,319
where it goes and we probably could have

1251
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,520
changed we could probably could have

1252
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,780
called it

1253
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,900
um append only ledgers for bgp but

1254
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,579
blockchain's much more provocative and

1255
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:55,079
gets people upset so we're going to just

1256
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,180
uh go for this

1257
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,039
um just in one slide I want to just cut

1258
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,020
to the chase to see it tell you what

1259
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,640
we've found and then I'm going to

1260
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,579
meander a bit and then we'll come back

1261
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:07,319
to it so just want to make sure that

1262
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:09,960
everybody's clear as possible on ways

1263
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,520
that something like a blockchain could

1264
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,680
be used for a routing protocol like bgp

1265
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,119
although it could be used

1266
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,000
for probably any writing protocol

1267
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,339
um so a DCS a distributed consensus

1268
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:21,660
system that uses something like

1269
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,740
blockchain it doesn't have to be

1270
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,599
blockchain again but

1271
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,339
um a lot of us are getting more familiar

1272
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:27,299
with that

1273
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:29,099
could be used out of bands something

1274
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:33,059
like rpki does for bgp to to supplement

1275
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:36,480
existing bgp management but perhaps by

1276
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,539
using smart contracts so smart contracts

1277
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:42,240
are if then programs that are stored on

1278
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,339
blockchains to run

1279
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:46,740
uh when predetermined conditions are met

1280
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,599
so like if

1281
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:52,680
Bob signs a document and that's sent to

1282
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,000
the blockchain

1283
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,160
then the smart contract would initiate

1284
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,400
payment or a transfer of a particular

1285
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,280
asset so automate automates those those

1286
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,559
agreements

1287
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,099
um so a bgp related smart contract could

1288
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:10,140
be executed immediately when some

1289
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,000
conditions such as receiving an update

1290
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,640
with too many pre-pens or

1291
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,219
or some sort of a hijacking is detected

1292
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,859
and so the action could be

1293
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:23,040
to deny an update after Consulting a

1294
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,460
blockchain that you've created

1295
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,698
it could be something as simple as using

1296
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:32,040
blockchain to securely store config

1297
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,120
files or row as

1298
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,880
maybe the irrs could use blockchain to

1299
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,679
store these and before they distribute

1300
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:42,779
the the row as

1301
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:45,600
um and we we dealt with that in in the

1302
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,880
draft as well

1303
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,179
tools do exist to do this today

1304
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:53,460
but a blockchain does have potential

1305
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:56,040
advantages in that it's transparent it's

1306
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,839
immutable it's secure

1307
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,540
it could be used globally

1308
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,520
um or within the domain

1309
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,259
so that's kind of cutting the chase that

1310
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:05,339
just kind of gives you overview let me

1311
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:07,080
Meander just for a little bit

1312
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,600
next leg

1313
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,339
so there's as I mentioned a variety

1314
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:13,380
proposals that have been happening for

1315
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,000
those of you that may just despise

1316
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,339
talking about blockchain and the ITF it

1317
01:09:17,339 --> 01:09:20,040
is starting to infiltrate the IHF there

1318
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,960
are some potential working groups

1319
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,620
um

1320
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:26,238
one involving a secure asset transfer

1321
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,399
between blockchains being able to

1322
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,899
provide interoperability between

1323
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:32,640
blockchains

1324
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,560
it very well may become a working group

1325
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,179
I'm not sure if that's happened or if

1326
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:38,460
that will happen this week and supply

1327
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,979
chain Integrity transparency and Trust

1328
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:43,198
which is also based upon a

1329
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,859
penned only Ledger

1330
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:49,799
so there are proposals happening

1331
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,259
we've received as I said questions about

1332
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:55,980
how DLT in networking could be

1333
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,739
handled and so we've we've been

1334
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:00,960
discussing that in some other forums we

1335
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,940
did hold a side meeting to discuss this

1336
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,400
a couple High tips ago this ITF there

1337
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,640
was a networking in metaverse side

1338
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,719
meeting

1339
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:12,239
uh and blockchain and metaverse work

1340
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,980
hand in hand so you can know who owns

1341
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,679
what in some sort of a metaverse

1342
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,739
uh this is just an informational draft

1343
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:21,840
it's not an endorsement and we're not

1344
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,880
again asking for anything except for

1345
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,860
advice as to whether this is something

1346
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,719
that we should be working on

1347
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:30,420
in this working group or elsewhere

1348
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,820
and it ends it asks the question is it

1349
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,460
possible to use a distributed consensus

1350
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,739
system like blockchain

1351
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:40,260
um to manage bgp and the answer is yes

1352
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,880
whether it's a good idea or not that's

1353
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,080
another question next slide

1354
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:47,520
um

1355
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,620
so just let me just fly through these

1356
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,300
these ones real quick

1357
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,739
um if you don't if you're not familiar

1358
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:54,900
with the LTS just then you just kind of

1359
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,940
get it on your own but

1360
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,280
um cryptocurrencies and DLCs they don't

1361
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,320
care much about the underlying provider

1362
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,120
Network they just assume that it works

1363
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,500
they have their own peer-to-peer

1364
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,699
networking

1365
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:07,500
um you know with a pool of Transport

1366
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,659
layer connections and they've done a

1367
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:11,460
pretty good job of securing their

1368
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:14,960
application next slide

1369
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,179
uh there this is what basically their

1370
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:19,860
view of it is is that they have this

1371
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,960
peer-to-peer network with many nodes

1372
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,640
sometimes it's millions of nodes in the

1373
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,400
case of the global blockchain that are

1374
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,320
very verifying transactions and

1375
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,060
executing smart contracts and things and

1376
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,880
it just runs over this IP network next

1377
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,120
slide

1378
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:37,380
this is the architecture that within the

1379
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,000
IEEE anyway that we've kind of been

1380
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,940
using in most of the uh the groups where

1381
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,739
you have your session layer whether

1382
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:45,179
transactions and blocks are being

1383
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:46,739
created

1384
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:49,080
um above that is a consensus layer where

1385
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,640
you're either either using proof of work

1386
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,540
or proof of stake to uh create these

1387
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,159
blocks and the transactions that are in

1388
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,380
these blocks and then the contract layer

1389
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,100
and um application protocol layer in the

1390
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,719
application layer next slide

1391
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:06,780
[Music]

1392
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,340
um

1393
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,800
on my flight over here I listen to a

1394
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,239
podcast which I think is one of the best

1395
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,340
podcasts out there

1396
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,940
my only argument is uh that they should

1397
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,739
have more of them but it's uh Leslie

1398
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:23,280
daigle's um consequences and this last

1399
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,520
one that they had which was on uh

1400
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,360
um

1401
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,699
cyber criminal gangs at the end of it

1402
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:30,900
they start talking about using

1403
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,699
blockchain and so my ears picked up

1404
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:34,980
about how Maybe

1405
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,239
um you know criminals have their own

1406
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,460
ecosystem it's gotten very professional

1407
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,900
even accepted and blockchain could

1408
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,620
potentially be used as a base for the

1409
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,719
good guys ecosystem to help counteract

1410
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:49,560
that

1411
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,780
because blockchain helped show proof of

1412
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:54,840
where criminal activity is occurring

1413
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,820
um it'll make the bad guys expend more

1414
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,340
effort than perhaps intelligence gained

1415
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,739
and the whole idea of blockchain is to

1416
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:03,420
make it publicly visible

1417
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,980
and perhaps we can use that to our

1418
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,360
advantage

1419
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,060
looks like

1420
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,400
you could use regular database like a

1421
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,340
SQL or nosql database to do these kind

1422
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,900
of things but

1423
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,300
these are some of the potential

1424
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,340
drawbacks that they are controlled by

1425
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,679
administrator they are a client server

1426
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:25,679
in nature that malicious actors can more

1427
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,320
easily alter the data than you could on

1428
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,179
a blockchain

1429
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:31,260
um

1430
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,300
administrator decides which date is

1431
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,340
accessible and visible

1432
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,140
the good thing about them is that

1433
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,580
they're easy to implement and maintain

1434
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:42,320
it very fast next slide

1435
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,420
um there's a lot of opportunities

1436
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,640
outside of using for bgp including

1437
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,760
trusting capture uh packet datas if

1438
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,620
you're capturing data from your network

1439
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,540
you can maybe store that on a blockchain

1440
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,640
because you may trust that more

1441
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,440
and a variety of other opportunities as

1442
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,820
well

1443
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,159
um Dino has worked on this with regards

1444
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,840
to lisp he worked with the Nexus

1445
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,800
community

1446
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,960
and um

1447
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,360
he used the lisp to help DLT

1448
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,260
applications Define the best nodes

1449
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,080
okay

1450
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,980
uh I'm gonna

1451
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,739
um skip this one go to the very last one

1452
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:21,000
so

1453
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,980
how about just look at that last that

1454
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,260
diagram right there um and I'll stand on

1455
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,140
this it's a kind of very similar to rpki

1456
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,520
you could have bgp clients that are also

1457
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,980
utilizing a distributed consensus system

1458
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,020
which may have a bgp block table in

1459
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,760
there including smart contracts that

1460
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:43,199
they look to before they uh act on

1461
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,820
certain things it's kind of similar to

1462
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:47,460
using rpki it could be replacement for

1463
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:51,300
rppi or an addendum to it

1464
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,699
um that's it good time correct questions

1465
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:57,620
or yeah David

1466
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,120
I'm putter

1467
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,620
um so a fundamental aspect of

1468
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,420
blockchains is that you have proof of

1469
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,159
work in some form which can be proof of

1470
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:07,140
CPU usage proof of storage proof of

1471
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,520
stake

1472
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,340
um the way or the actually only way I

1473
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,320
can see this being useful is if you have

1474
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,620
proof of network ownership of something

1475
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,719
where that something could be addresses

1476
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:21,420
or an ASM are you actively looking into

1477
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,460
making that the base of the blockchain

1478
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,659
or

1479
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:26,760
is that are you still too early for this

1480
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,679
or we're not actively really looking at

1481
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:29,820
anything except for what I just

1482
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:33,679
described so but very good point

1483
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,300
Jeff has uh hi to Eric here user bgp a

1484
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,280
protocol advice says is very slow to

1485
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,480
start with

1486
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,300
and blockchain is not noted to be fast

1487
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,280
true

1488
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,060
um

1489
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,760
so for your use cases

1490
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,320
having this as part of the protocol

1491
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,540
control loops is probably not a great

1492
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,340
thing you know I would suggest just

1493
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,440
simply taking those use cases throwing

1494
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,000
them into the fire and you know stay

1495
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,380
warm by that

1496
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:05,159
fair enough but bgp also is about policy

1497
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:08,159
and policies about money so places where

1498
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,780
you know policy can actually you know

1499
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,280
take things as input to know whether

1500
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,920
it's you know people agreeing to you

1501
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,179
know announce this route after you've

1502
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,679
paid your bill and your bills registered

1503
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:18,179
in a blockchain you know something like

1504
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:20,400
that that's a reasonable thing people

1505
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,020
wanting to actually have their address

1506
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,179
delegation contracts no move through a

1507
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,280
blockchain those way of saying that

1508
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,260
they're transferring addresses so people

1509
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,179
like Heron and ripe at other places

1510
01:16:30,179 --> 01:16:32,460
obviously have their own systems maybe

1511
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,780
they're good targets for you to have

1512
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,460
this conversation

1513
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,420
but uh mostly look at this as use cases

1514
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:42,000
not as a transfer of centralized things

1515
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,620
that have to go through some sort of

1516
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,500
delegated infrastructure pki makes sense

1517
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,380
for a lot of what pgp does for the

1518
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,820
things that are more provided to

1519
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,000
provider type relationships that's not a

1520
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,020
bad thing

1521
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,239
thanks

1522
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:00,600
Dean one minute question not more

1523
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,179
be quick okay I'll be very quick

1524
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:04,920
um so um

1525
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,659
I'm just going to respond to your point

1526
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:08,940
uh he didn't say he was going to use bgp

1527
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,100
and have the rib B in blockchain because

1528
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,020
thank you for not doing that because it

1529
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,300
is but it could be used for

1530
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,739
administrative things and I was going to

1531
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:18,960
ask the same question is if this would

1532
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,420
could be a good thing to prove ownership

1533
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,159
of address prefix that have been

1534
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,080
allocated by the Registries that would

1535
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,000
have some really good use

1536
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,340
yeah thank you all right

1537
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,500
Mike so please do think what you're

1538
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,679
going to do with this work uh I mean we

1539
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:36,239
are happily

1540
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,520
we're happy to give you an opportunity

1541
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,500
to introduce the world but practically

1542
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,080
you really need to identify your focus

1543
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,260
and start putting more meat on the buns

1544
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,760
that's otherwise very good if anybody's

1545
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,260
interested please contact me and we'll

1546
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,400
go thanks thank you

1547
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,900
hello do you hear me yeah it's okay okay

1548
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,360
so welcome to the cyan update

1549
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,179
presentation uh in this presentation we

1550
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:12,000
are going to tell you

1551
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,280
oh sorry

1552
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,040
okay we are going to tell you what we

1553
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,280
have done since we were here at the ietf

1554
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,440
for the first time in that was at the

1555
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,719
ietf 113 in Vienna

1556
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,360
so there we there were two events where

1557
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,500
we uh presented sign

1558
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,699
there was a side meeting about sign

1559
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:38,460
where we gave introduction and we asked

1560
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,699
you for input uh suggestions about uh

1561
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:45,719
design ietf strategy and I was also a

1562
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:47,640
sign presentation a very high level

1563
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,400
overview of the routing area open

1564
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,440
meeting and then we got a lot of

1565
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,780
feedback we realized there is also

1566
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:58,739
interest but people told us sign is

1567
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:01,679
really a very big system and the ietf is

1568
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,239
not really good at the existence but

1569
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:07,199
more at small components so that's uh we

1570
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,020
got the advice to try to break sign down

1571
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,480
in smaller junks and that's what we

1572
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,640
started to do or try to do next slide

1573
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,199
please

1574
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:19,140
so what did we do so far uh we have

1575
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,540
written and published three internet

1576
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:25,320
rest uh one is a sign overview drafts uh

1577
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,420
here we try to explain sign a bit more

1578
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:30,900
in detail and also a bit more per uh

1579
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,080
core components uh than the sine

1580
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,960
component analysis uh is also about the

1581
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,580
core components but then more how

1582
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,980
they've interact with each other how

1583
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,300
much they are depending on each other

1584
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,880
and also how much they use existing

1585
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,360
protocols extended reuse it or maybe not

1586
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,380
use it

1587
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:52,679
uh and then the third draft is about to

1588
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:55,739
sign control pane a pki where we already

1589
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:58,860
in detail Uh Kevin specification about

1590
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,219
one of the sign core components

1591
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,920
and we presented these drafts in several

1592
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,520
energy entry meetings uh as a base for

1593
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,820
discussion we chose penergy because we

1594
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:16,080
do not have a home yet at ietf and the

1595
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,360
Passover Network and research group

1596
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,140
seemed for us the most close but we also

1597
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:24,060
want to share our work with you with the

1598
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,460
rooting Area Community so that's also

1599
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,840
why I'm here

1600
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,699
next slide

1601
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:33,060
and now I want to very shortly give you

1602
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,699
an idea what these three address are

1603
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,400
about this sign overview draft discusses

1604
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,260
the motivations behind the design

1605
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,480
architecture it gives a high level

1606
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,820
overview of the fundamental components

1607
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,920
and it concludes with an old view of

1608
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,140
current sign deployments because it is

1609
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,420
not only a salary but really already in

1610
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,880
use here is the link to the draft if you

1611
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,699
want to read it for yourself next slide

1612
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:00,000
so very short sign in a nutshell a sign

1613
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,100
is based a part based interdomain

1614
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,340
Network architecture The Three core

1615
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:08,100
components are the control pane PPI

1616
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,320
which is working on responsible for

1617
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,140
authentication and which builds the base

1618
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,239
for the unique sign trust model

1619
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:17,280
and then we have the control plane

1620
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,280
component which is doing the routing in

1621
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,679
that it's constructs and the test image

1622
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:25,560
path segments and it authenticates path

1623
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,520
information

1624
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,380
and then in the data playing the

1625
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,320
password forwarding happens uh and what

1626
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,620
here uh takes place is that here these

1627
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,659
path segments are combined into paths

1628
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:38,940
this pass information is put in the

1629
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,040
header of the packets and the packet

1630
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,900
forwarding is done based on these past

1631
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:46,920
information so the the forwarding is is

1632
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,900
based on the information in a packet and

1633
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,420
not the routing tables and that means

1634
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,159
that you use that sign uses simple

1635
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:56,280
routers and a stateless operation next

1636
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,360
slide please

1637
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,940
uh as I already told you it is really

1638
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,580
already in new sign there are several

1639
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,920
service providers in Switzerland Europe

1640
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,219
and also in Asia which provides iron and

1641
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:09,600
this is growing

1642
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,140
there is an internet exchange Point C6

1643
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,659
which offers signed peerings and we also

1644
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:17,580
there are also customers working with

1645
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,440
sign especially the Swiss financial

1646
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,520
institutions the secure stress Financial

1647
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,920
Network where the Swiss National Bank

1648
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,320
and also this risk clearing Institute

1649
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,900
and the big bigger space banks are

1650
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,179
working together sharing their data

1651
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:35,640
based on sign also education government

1652
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,460
as well as a healthcare Network

1653
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:43,080
then also research networks having a

1654
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,900
connect based on sign and we have the

1655
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,360
sign lab this is more like a research

1656
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,820
test bet where we can try out new

1657
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,980
features

1658
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:56,520
so design component analysis is really

1659
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,100
analyzing this core components from a

1660
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,719
functionality perspective

1661
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,600
it describes how that depends and it

1662
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,060
interacts with each other outputs

1663
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,640
properties provided and it tries to

1664
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,340
answer the questions what are the main

1665
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:14,040
components of cyan can they be used

1666
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,440
independently and that what existing

1667
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,380
Protocols are used reuse extended or

1668
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,600
maybe why are they not used and it

1669
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,540
briefly touches on the maturity level of

1670
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,060
components and extensions if you are

1671
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,679
interested in this draft here is the

1672
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:29,580

1673
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,820
uh okay very shortly now the this

1674
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,880
dependency graph uh on top we have this

1675
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,340
control plane uh public key

1676
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,739
infrastructure which is responsible for

1677
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:43,620
the authentication this gets us input uh

1678
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,840
bootstrapping information uh among

1679
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,460
others uh some kind of trustful

1680
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:50,940
contracts and lose time sync and as the

1681
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:55,080
outputs uh it it delivers a sign trust

1682
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,300
model which I will shortly describe

1683
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:00,199
later and authenticated control messages

1684
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:02,640
this is the input for the control plane

1685
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,159
for the routing part and then as an

1686
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:07,620
outcome you have this authenticated path

1687
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:10,020
segments which the data plane uses to

1688
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,300
construct these paths which it puts in

1689
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,760
the past header and the the outcome then

1690
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,500
in the end is secure into domain

1691
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,480
multi-pass communication

1692
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,520
next slide please

1693
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,000
so and then our next draft is uh more

1694
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,620
like really a specification of this

1695
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:28,199
control pen PK I visit which we think is

1696
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:30,659
the most independent part uh core

1697
01:24:30,659 --> 01:24:34,140
component of sign uh it presents the

1698
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,480
trust concept and design of this control

1699
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,840
plane pki it provides a short overview

1700
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,880
of the certificates keys and the roles

1701
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,040
involved it gives also detailed

1702
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,719
specifications of these building blocks

1703
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:47,580
and it concludes with several

1704
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,280
considerations about deploying it here I

1705
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,780
can link to the craft

1706
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:54,300
can you please send a comment

1707
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,219
so in here is this trust model very

1708
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,820
shortly it is based on isolation domains

1709
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:03,659
isds this consists of a logical grouping

1710
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:06,239
of an automa systems that share a

1711
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,640
uniform trust environment like for

1712
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,800
instance a common jurisdiction

1713
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,980
each isolation domain is administered by

1714
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,880
several core as they compile the ISD

1715
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,000
core and this ISD core negotiates this

1716
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,920
trust policy or contract which we call

1717
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,100
the trust root configuration so and then

1718
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:29,100
the certification authorities in an ISD

1719
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,960
that can only create certificates for

1720
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,560
the autonomous systems in their own

1721
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,300
isolation domain so you see also the

1722
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,100
picture these are three isolation

1723
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,179
domains they have the core

1724
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:44,460
core ISD course and each isolation

1725
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,199
domain has also his own trust food

1726
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:48,120
Constructor configuration

1727
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:51,000
with the next one please

1728
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,960
so that was in a very short fast tempo

1729
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,080
uh what we have done so far

1730
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:01,320
uh that we are doing uh now is uh to

1731
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,940
address the received feedback and we

1732
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,400
still welcome very much reviews and

1733
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,719
commands from you

1734
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,260
uh based on this feedback we want to

1735
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:11,699
improve the existing draft because they

1736
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:14,040
are really the very first versions of

1737
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,960
these drafts and there is a lot of room

1738
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,020
for improvements then we also want to

1739
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:22,020
write specifications for the other two

1740
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,540
core components the control plane and

1741
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,639
the data plane and in the meantime we

1742
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,620
keep coming to the iatf share our

1743
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:31,620
progress and source with you and we try

1744
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,960
to build up uh yes support and a

1745
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,880
community

1746
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,159
um and yeah that was that was it thank

1747
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,380
you for your attention and if there are

1748
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,300
questions or any feedback please welcome

1749
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,860
thank you

1750
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:53,159
thank you for being here and uh sharing

1751
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:56,340
what's going on with sun so I believe

1752
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:59,280
you need to focus on those things one is

1753
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,380
service specification because if someone

1754
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,020
else is interested in building systems

1755
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,060
that can interrupt with your system you

1756
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,380
need to clear specify what you are doing

1757
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,260
an idea from the right place to do so

1758
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:12,900
number two is potentially interworking

1759
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,199
between common internet run by bgps and

1760
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:19,139
and immigration scenarios tunneling

1761
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:21,540
scenarios how you authenticate non-san

1762
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,820
demand software yeah

1763
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:27,620
and thank you okay thank you

1764
01:27:30,139 --> 01:27:32,520
thanks everyone we are giving you three

1765
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,080
minutes back and we'll see you tomorrow
