1
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,620
[Music]

2
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,000
and as we don't have a crowded agenda

3
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,260
we'll start in about 10 minutes so

4
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,300
everybody can eat some lunch who is

5
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,220
supposed to have lunch

6
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,140
if you steal something I won't tell

7
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,500
anybody

8
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,040
so hello everybody let's start as we

9
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,480
said we don't have a very crowded agenda

10
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,220
but we have a few topics um and let's

11
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,779
try to get to it

12
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,100
um so we have this first part of the

13
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,720
agenda which is uh more our

14
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,220
administrative

15
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,660
um part

16
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Cindy do you want to take that yeah and

17
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,399
then like the second part will we will

18
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,959
hand over to the RPC basically and

19
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,940
running through a couple of discussions

20
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,180
here

21
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,240
should we go around the table or should

22
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,120
we have this let Alexa say hi

23
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,959
on the agenda

24
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,440
so I didn't I didn't know that we had an

25
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
entire slide just with introductions and

26
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,139
that was a very detailed agenda

27
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,459
I just looked at number one and I

28
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,420
figured the rest was actually other

29
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,339
stuff but wow

30
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,560
so for attendance all of the arcsab

31
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,600
members are present we do have a couple

32
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,980
of people who are

33
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,320
um observing remotely from mitico so

34
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
please do use the microphones

35
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
and you know we've got observers in the

36
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,959
room as well

37
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,139
um does anyone one have any changes to

38
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,980
today's agenda

39
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,040
anything to add

40
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,779
okay that sounds like no then I think

41
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,160
the next thing on the agenda was the

42
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,319
intro and the welcome for Alexis

43
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,639
I'm pretty sure I've met all of you

44
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
already but um my name is Alexis Rossi

45
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,019
and

46
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,180
um I've started about two months ago I

47
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,740
feel like I'm still

48
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,579
trying to learn all of the vocabulary

49
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,740
but I had it before this meeting I'm not

50
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,899
gonna lie and then I came to the

51
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,720
meetings here in London realized I still

52
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,360
don't know all the vocabulary so

53
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,000
um anyway uh right now what I'm mainly

54
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,100
working on is

55
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,760
um the RFC editor.org revamp with

56
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,440
torchbox if you have any input you'd

57
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,120
like to give me on that

58
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,399
um I would love to hear it

59
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,959
um I've been working on making sure that

60
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,660
all of our archiving Partners have full

61
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,240
copies of uh the rfcs and

62
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,060
starting to work on getting uh our

63
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,860
outlinks from rfcs and things like that

64
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,940
actually archived so that we have

65
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,579
completeness in our Archive of stuff so

66
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,100
those are kinds of my my things at the

67
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,560
moment and um please feel free to come

68
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,300
say hi to me if we haven't met already

69
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,660
[Music]

70
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,160
yeah welcome and great to have you here

71
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,320
okay

72
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,940
um then the next thing we had on the

73
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,040
agenda is a tooling update from Robert

74
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,240
Sparks who is joining us

75
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,380
we have ourselves related and editorial

76
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,360
stream related

77
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,500
um

78
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,160
work that needs to be done in xmlrc and

79
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,779
data tracker

80
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,420
um these are queued for

81
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,000
probably December beginning of January

82
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
we're not expecting anything is going to

83
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,100
try to come through the stream before

84
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,199
then

85
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,680
um don't see any uh

86
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,779
uh difficulties anything is likely to

87
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,459
become a blocking Point

88
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,620
um it's just a matter of of slotting in

89
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,920
the work

90
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,500
so for asset that's basically the

91
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,720
balloting abilities or like is there

92
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,639
anything else you know okay that's not

93
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,980
urgent I guess I think that balloting is

94
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,079
the only thing that's left for the our

95
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,420
subgroup proper

96
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,279
perfect thank you

97
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,959
yeah I mean even if we did need to

98
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,820
ballot we can do it by email for a

99
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,800
little while but I don't think I don't

100
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,779
see anything on the horizon either so

101
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,100
I think we have time

102
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,579
as I said we don't have a lot of stuff

103
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,199
but we don't have any documents which is

104
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,059
our main purpose

105
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,439
um so that was the first part of the

106
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
agenda and I'm basically just heading

107
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,859
over to the apostino

108
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,500
okay so actually this first one is I

109
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,119
don't think we own it so I probably put

110
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,799
it in the wrong place

111
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,619
um I think Lara's raised the issue about

112
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,940
rswg.org and and if there's anything

113
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,240
that uh the working group wants to do I

114
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,559
just registered it

115
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,020
um rsap.org was taken but that one

116
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,120
wasn't and then and so I haven't and I

117
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,380
might have even assigned it over to

118
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,419
record I don't know I can't remember but

119
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,220
sort of if it's there for somebody to do

120
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,140
something with it we have it right and

121
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,880
we probably I don't know who should own

122
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,280
it it's the trust or whatever but

123
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,059
um it's available

124
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
okay

125
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,900
all right

126
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,760
um yeah I think I'll talk to Pete but I

127
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,400
think probably will

128
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,080
you know do it he should be what you've

129
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,700
already did and like you know spin up

130
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,140
the site but it's just like boring but

131
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,120
like is where you go so all these people

132
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,918
I think that's the plan thank you

133
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,400
okay so the next one was for the headers

134
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,760
and boilerplate and um it was just to

135
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,380
check whether there were any objections

136
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,720
to the proposed path forward

137
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,940
um and it was namely

138
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,380
um

139
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,240
the RPC would be in charge of headers

140
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
and boilerplate material and moving the

141
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,679
page that the IAB has on their website

142
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,400
to the rpcs the RFC editor website

143
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,480
um

144
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,100
wondering if there's any objections to

145
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,260
that

146
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,299
so remind me

147
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,080
um

148
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,559
what do you mean by in charge of or I

149
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,620
think that's a word serious but so so

150
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,780
it basically maintains the site or is

151
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,660
responsible for the content

152
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,740
because I think the streams can

153
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,900
decide their own boilerplate right

154
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,820
but it's basically you would you would

155
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,340
host the the content

156
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,380
um and and basically the streams or the

157
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,020
RSM or the rswg would

158
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,660
instruct changes to be made correct we

159
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,419
would just maintain the the

160
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,280
um the term the outcome of what the

161
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,039
streams say that that seems fine to me

162
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,400
we should probably have this little bit

163
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,380
of a description about how changes

164
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,240
technically get proposed and get

165
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,340
approved right

166
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,360
um because I think some of the

167
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,059
boilerplate is shared across all the

168
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,460
streams and that would be an rswg rset

169
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,820
thing and some of the polo plate is per

170
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,840
stream

171
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,900
and that would be under the Stream

172
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,360
approving bodies control I think it's a

173
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
terminology right um

174
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,740
okay

175
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,220
yes so so the irtf could change their

176
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,919
part of the boilerplate um but not the

177
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,380
shared part the SharePoint would need to

178
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,820
have agreement across the streams yeah

179
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,140
so is that something you think that

180
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,900
should go with that information

181
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,080
so I hope this might already be in in

182
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,620
the rfcs that create the streams right

183
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,260
um and I don't know but it if it does it

184
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,059
might just be worthwhile putting that

185
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,400
maybe in a in a little box and and point

186
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,919
to those documents if we find that that

187
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,600
this what I just outlined doesn't really

188
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,980
exist in the written down form and

189
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,320
specifically I don't think this

190
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,620
shared part is under the control of the

191
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,940
rswgraph process I don't think that's

192
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,120
part of the model 3 document if I

193
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,740
remember practice that we might want to

194
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,620
make that so right because if that's the

195
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,220
only logical option so Lars

196
00:20:59,220 --> 00:20:59,760
um

197
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,740
Memphis Elliot section 3.2.6 of RFC 9280

198
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,100
covers boilerplates and the process for

199
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,679
updating them

200
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,900
so I'm not quite sure what you're

201
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,700
proposing that would be

202
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,039
either inline or differ from that but I

203
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,600
think how the you know what happens

204
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,520
within the streams is up to the streams

205
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,140
to decide in terms of their own approval

206
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,600
process I gather and then it goes

207
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,660
through the rsab has to approve

208
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,600
something and then there's the RPC that

209
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,520
has a role and then the ietf has it

210
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,159
absolutely so if we I couldn't recall

211
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,419
that we said that if we say that so I

212
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,880
don't know if it was anything uh more or

213
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
different than what's in the document I

214
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,539
wasn't remembering that we had put that

215
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,340
in the document so then we just

216
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,500
basically pointed to that section of

217
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,419
9280 and we're done on the website it's

218
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:52,860
our new episode so the purpose of this

219
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,860
website is only to have one place where

220
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,960
you can easily find information what are

221
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,799
the current boilerplates for each stream

222
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,980
foreign

223
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,720
[Music]

224
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
the next one was just uh a reminder that

225
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,179
we created the arpet

226
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,320
um I didn't see any major objections

227
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,880
so I don't think there's much to discuss

228
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,740
unless any of you wanted to to say

229
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,700
anything I don't think I heard from

230
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,159
everyone so I just wanted to make sure

231
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,299
um

232
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,100
okay I just wanted to make sure there

233
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,679
were no no major concerns with

234
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,320
what we've done

235
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,900
uh no concern I'm just like the the

236
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,039
description you have of the proof is

237
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,900
very like General and like when we had

238
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,159
like a little bit of a discussion about

239
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,659
this so I think what we really need to

240
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,299
figure out is to find the right boundary

241
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,400
like we have to discuss what and that

242
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,980
probably just need experience um so if

243
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,559
you if you just keep us up to date

244
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,080
was about her experience like where the

245
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
split is and how it should work and how

246
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,600
it works for you I think that's

247
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,460
important

248
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,260
okay right we're trying to do the right

249
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,580
thing so

250
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,559
um our goal is hopefully to have you

251
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,360
know also to get input from our pet

252
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,679
about what needs wider discussion and

253
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,120
what doesn't

254
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,900
um

255
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,280
and keep you apprised of what's

256
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,380
happening and also the list archives are

257
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,120
open right so anyone can see what's

258
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,220
happening there and and provide input

259
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,020
that

260
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,460
um you know they think it needs to be

261
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,140
discussed elsewhere

262
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,179
so I think that one bad outcome would be

263
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,220
if like we end up discussing all topics

264
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,900
in two places and have like just like a

265
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,760
huge amount of people or more people are

266
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,080
needed and like having big discussions

267
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,700
about all kinds of little things that

268
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,559
would be the worst outcome so that's

269
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,659
that's what we should avoid

270
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:10,500
um yeah

271
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,520
so the the list is open as far as

272
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,220
archives but people can't actually who

273
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,659
are not numbers of the list cannot

274
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:19,980
discuss it there

275
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,659
and actually that was

276
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:22,980
um a discussion point we had had with

277
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,620
Jay and within that team which was

278
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,700
um we don't want it to be another

279
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,220
discussion area for the whole Community

280
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,720
right if it's going to be a public

281
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,039
discussion it should happen in a public

282
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,860
forum so it but like what I what I kind

283
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,360
of saw last time already is that you had

284
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,980
like a topic that you discussed in the

285
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,900
art prep and then you brought it to the

286
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,000
rsip and then like all the people from

287
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
Rapid were still involved in the

288
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,880
discussion and then it came to rsip and

289
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,700
then maybe arsip decides to bring it to

290
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,039
um rswg and then like you know you just

291
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,740
like get more and more people in maybe a

292
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,059
small discussion involved so like I

293
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,980
think that's that's something to watch

294
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,659
out for

295
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,820
okay I think that's that's part of the

296
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,820
learning curve for us right yeah I sort

297
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
of see this right I'm sorry

298
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,440
so I mean iPad is something that's

299
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,740
internal to the RPC right and so the the

300
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,520
r the rsap and the rswg shouldn't really

301
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,380
ever hear from the r-pad because they

302
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,840
talk to you and then you talk to like us

303
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,900
right and and if you create this team

304
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,820
internally that that's that's your call

305
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,440
and totally fine and then you you use

306
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,820
them for what you want to use them for

307
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,740
but it doesn't change the structure at

308
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,760
all right

309
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,220
and I think if you think about it that

310
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,539
way right then then there's a pretty

311
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,919
clear line

312
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,419
um and and we wouldn't have those the

313
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,520
same people in the discussions really

314
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,020
yeah and just to say that again this is

315
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,760
a learning experience so like we we have

316
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,140
to figure out how to get this right and

317
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,460
how this works best for you that's

318
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,970
improves

319
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,099
[Music]

320
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,700
so the next one was about the use of you

321
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,480
it's a it's a pretty detailed XML and um

322
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,279
and some of you have already heard this

323
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,659
but I wanted to share it with all of

324
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,940
this dream uh managers because it'll

325
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,620
impact all of you

326
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,299
um

327
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,900
sorry

328
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,340
so

329
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,820
in earlier times

330
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,720
non-ascii characters could not be

331
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
included in the rfcs unless or within

332
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,419
running paragraph text

333
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:26,039
unless the you notation the U element

334
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,380
was used

335
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,600
and that was found to be an error 7997

336
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,760
does not require the use of you

337
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,299
and so XML to RFC has been updated

338
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,240
to allow non-ascii characters to appear

339
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,220
within t

340
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,299
um

341
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,000
but we added some text to the style

342
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
guide that specifies if

343
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,860
if those characters are required like

344
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,299
understanding those characters is

345
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,580
required for protocol operation then

346
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,440
they should be spelled out right so you

347
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,220
notation should be included and

348
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,659
um we are hoping that the stream editors

349
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,240
will help look at that as you're

350
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,279
reviewing the documents right like is it

351
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,760
required for proper protocol operation

352
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,980
should the U element be included

353
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,840
in the document

354
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,480
yeah

355
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,260
rehearsing the Sunday discussion a

356
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,880
little bit so we probably the metal item

357
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,559
for us is to to not make sure that we

358
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,580
duplicate

359
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Sunday items uh um with this group but

360
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,460
so you can ask the street managers right

361
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,220
but for the isg right we don't review

362
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,039
the XML and so

363
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,200
um we people look at the HTML or the

364
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,059
text rendering typically and they will

365
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,539
they they might spot a Unicode character

366
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,279
um that that doesn't have the

367
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,799
parentheses uppercase expansion in it

368
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,659
and they might flag it but since we're

369
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,179
not looking at the XML

370
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,820
um we I guarantee you will not find

371
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,679
things and I also guarantee you it won't

372
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,779
be a priority for ads when they do

373
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,880
reviews so it's really you guys that

374
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,200
need to be because really really the

375
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,059
only ones other than the authors and or

376
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,620
even most authors will look at the XML

377
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,539
anymore uh it's really you guys that

378
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:04,740
need to look at that

379
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,659
would it help if we had something like

380
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,240
uh if we asked ID nits to be updated to

381
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,039
highlight like where those characters

382
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,580
appear

383
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,860
I don't know what's the answer because

384
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,960
so I'm an author of a draft that that

385
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,419
heavily uses Greek letters for math

386
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,820
and if you highlight all of them it's

387
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,520
gonna be very very noisy and Robert has

388
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,039
his hand up

389
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,260
okay sorry

390
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,240
you know we when we looked at this on

391
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,299
the mailing list I think there were uh

392
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,400
at least two out there are two issues

393
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,779
right there were the first issue is what

394
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,700
to do with the instant draft

395
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,580
and the second issue was what to do

396
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,200
going forward

397
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,820
and

398
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,620
um without addressing the former let's

399
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,179
address the louder for the moment which

400
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,700
is that's a topic for the rswg to take

401
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
up

402
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,220
sorry I was gonna say without addressing

403
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,260
the former what to do about the instant

404
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,820
draft I think that one's settled already

405
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,220
at this point you've got to get even

406
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,659
closer because I still can't hear you

407
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm sorry okay

408
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,039
sorry

409
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,900
um I've never been accused of being too

410
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,539
soft spoken before

411
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,760
um what I was going to say is I think

412
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,159
the instant issue has already been

413
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,039
addressed in terms of the RFC the louder

414
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,039
issue then I think was a matter I think

415
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,520
John Levine had suggested that there

416
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,320
needs to be a lot more guidance on the

417
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,140
use of Unicode in drafts and that's an

418
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,020
issue for the rswg to pick up and I

419
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,399
think it'd be a good idea if somebody

420
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,399
wrote a draft on that

421
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,640
for the rswg

422
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,039
I just want to reinforce that the

423
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,159
tooling had been in the way it basically

424
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,840
deferred the problem by not letting

425
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,260
things into the draft archive and the

426
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,299
intent of the Repository

427
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:01,260
and that has not changed so

428
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,620
for weeks at this point people could be

429
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,559
introducing into internet grass

430
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,020
um not asking utf-8 and arbitrary parts

431
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,460
of the pros

432
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,039
so these are going to eventually bubble

433
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:14,899
into

434
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:18,240
publication request and one stream or

435
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,260
another

436
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,260
so it's something that if our slag is

437
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,140
where we build out the recommendations

438
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,620
for what is reasonable fine but it

439
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,179
really needs to be prioritized it's

440
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,520
going to be an issue sooner rather than

441
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,679
later

442
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,020
so we'll work item for the rswg to

443
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,820
potentially provide a guidelines

444
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,279
document or amend the current guidelines

445
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,659
for

446
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,440
encouraged use of Unicode in in IDs and

447
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,899
RCS so I guess can someone help me with

448
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,580
the timeline here when does this change

449
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,658
made xmod RFC

450
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,059
the change resume to an RFC the chance

451
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,220
is made to XML to RSC that's what I was

452
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,240
asking okay

453
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,120
um

454
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,140
a month ago

455
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,720
so there was a long discussion when it

456
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,899
was a realization that what the rsc's

457
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,120
that defined what we were supposed to be

458
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,039
said in public RC did

459
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,600
along these places where it was there

460
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,279
was a significant

461
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,080
um

462
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,640
overreach on what XML to Roc Limited

463
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,440
primarily because of a request that

464
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,960
Heather put in at the time to control

465
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,980
whether or not we had non-esque utf-8 in

466
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,080
general prose

467
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,880
bit 7991 and family did not have that

468
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,100
restriction and in fact it explicitly

469
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,559
called out it was it was the intent of

470
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,580
those documents to allow monastic utf-8

471
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,960
in running text

472
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,760
so I think a little bit of a process

473
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,020
problem here

474
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,820
which is

475
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,159
we have a situation where we have an RFC

476
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,779
which specifies what what the tools are

477
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,100
supposed to do

478
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,779
and then we've had a bunch of

479
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,100
freelancing where people went right and

480
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,799
made ad hoc changes so that so the tools

481
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,440
do not confirm with that document

482
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,799
um and just tomorrow we'll be discussing

483
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,500
how to document those that have changes

484
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,600
but the documents are supposed to

485
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,220
specify the things it currently is that

486
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,720
if it keeps changing under us then it's

487
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,980
not going to work

488
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,899
so it has to happen because that changes

489
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,640
have to stop

490
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,620
so it's not the document I changed it's

491
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,220
the tool I understand but

492
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,919
what is so what is the so the document

493
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,740
the as is document that John produced

494
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,059
what does it say

495
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,059
s

496
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,720
okay so this is

497
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,580
but like the tools were not installed

498
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,080
and still and wait for the RSW cheese

499
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,919
that's what I'm saying okay that's

500
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,940
something to discuss tomorrow

501
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,980
so the issue here Eric is that there was

502
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,399
a draft stalled on this point and so the

503
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,799
the question came to us

504
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,799
um by way of the RPC saying here's the

505
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,940
drought the RFC says this but XML to RFC

506
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,059
is doing that what do we do right I

507
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,740
understand but like that is a situation

508
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,980
every day because the because the

509
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,019
Twitter is not confirmed to someone 9a1

510
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,120
and so the two or four things that the

511
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,580
performers have known anyone and so

512
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,620
we've made a decision to allow people to

513
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,019
publish over the circumstances but

514
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,760
it can't be the case the tourists

515
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,860
continue to evolve without without this

516
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,539
revision of the rswg that's the point

517
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,220
that's the whole point of exercise okay

518
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,019
so I just want to make clear

519
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,419
one one aspect so what would you have

520
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,640
had the rsab say here differently than

521
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,019
what we said because I just want to

522
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,659
understand if we made it if if you think

523
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:52,740
we made an error I'd like to understand

524
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,620
what the error was the the so is that

525
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,320
the way the way 9280 specifies this if

526
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,179
there are situations where they require

527
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,880
policy decisions on short notice

528
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,700
the rsab is authorized to

529
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,099
make those decisions and then bring the

530
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,379
lswg that's what we're discussing right

531
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,940
now what to do next right because

532
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,418
they make a decision we were

533
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,219
interpreting the existing rfcs and

534
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,780
giving advice based on what's written

535
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,599
down by Community consensus

536
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,040
so um

537
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,839
let's have this discussion offline let's

538
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,580
try to wrap up this point for us here

539
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,619
now I said no

540
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,099
um just before we walk away from it to

541
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,719
helps

542
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,119
perhaps keep the conversation that we're

543
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,219
going to have in our swg

544
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,339
um

545
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,460
focused

546
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,560
there is policy about what the streams

547
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
allow

548
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,560
and there is what tools enforce

549
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,619
and the idea that

550
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,420
you're having this intense negative

551
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,839
reaction that the tools changed bothers

552
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:01,619
me

553
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,140
particularly when what we did was we

554
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,080
made the tools closer to what the

555
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,640
current documents set to do

556
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,920
yeah okay well again let's let's please

557
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,020
take this offline because I think uh

558
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,700
this is actually the wrong place to have

559
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,320
this detailed discussion but there is

560
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,300
one thing Miriam sorry I'm trying to

561
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,980
figure out the process here yeah that

562
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,720
was what I was going to say

563
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
yeah why isn't it the right place to

564
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,859
have the conversation if we're talking

565
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,420
about

566
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,760
take you know whether this goes to rswg

567
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,339
or not I'm not sure no no this is the

568
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:36,480
discussion I want to have but I don't

569
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,040
want I want to have the discussion about

570
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,480
taking it to the

571
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,060
um rswg and if that's the right process

572
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,440
here another discussion that we will

573
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,079
have in the arms yes so that's what I'm

574
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,119
trying to do so first of all you had

575
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,859
another point right you were trying to

576
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,079
reply to something no okay

577
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,800
um

578
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,500
so I've summarized like we had this

579
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,540
issue we changed something in the tools

580
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,300
to make it in line with the current RCs

581
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,099
um was that announced

582
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,640
to the rswg I think so we put a pin in

583
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,720
this for one second because I want to go

584
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,280
back to Sunday real quick because she

585
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,119
asked

586
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,480
the stream the proving bodies to review

587
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,260
the use of you in cases where the

588
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,700
Unicode is

589
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,619
um important to the operation of a

590
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,000
protocol and I want to make sure that

591
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,280
that you heard that I don't think that

592
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,859
review realistically will happen because

593
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,859
we don't look at the XML right and so um

594
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,500
we can try and we can

595
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,220
task maybe the rswg with um

596
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,460
talking about the the non-use use of of

597
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,700
Unicode but for the U part right it's

598
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,220
it's really that the the detailed

599
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,599
editing that you guys are doing that

600
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,300
will catch those for us hopefully

601
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,440
sorry unpin actually yeah this is let's

602
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,260
um so to that to that

603
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,880
um

604
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
I hope is to raise it for your awareness

605
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,400
and I hope that the street managers and

606
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,140
those reviewers will keep it in mind

607
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,520
when they're looking at the documents

608
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,940
but I do view the RPC as the backstop so

609
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,640
if things go by unnoticed we will be

610
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,140
asking questions so that's something you

611
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,060
should also be aware of right

612
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,220
um we'll be asking for advice if

613
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,680
something seems more than an example

614
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,060
so you you may be proposal to add this

615
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,160
to ID nits would that be helpful for the

616
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,800
RPC at least yeah I think adding it to

617
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,940
idinous would be great right because it

618
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,320
would at least cause the authors to look

619
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,359
at it yeah that totally makes sense to

620
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,680
me and then like I would think the

621
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,480
process is what closer to what you just

622
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,880
said like you should have an eye on this

623
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,260
and if there is uncertainty from your

624
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,520
side then you can come back to the

625
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,960
stream manager and figure out what the

626
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,420
right thing to do does that make sense I

627
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,220
mean yeah it's going to be very noisy

628
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,540
right because the only thing you can do

629
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,579
is for every utf-8 core point in a

630
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,500
document you're gonna you know did you

631
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,359
mean to put this in the U or not that's

632
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,040
the end that's the question I mean like

633
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,839
taking this current example it was part

634
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,700
of uh a heading right

635
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
it was kind of like a subheading of a

636
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,700
section or whatever the Unicode

637
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,079
character right but I'm thinking about

638
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,760
it that's a very clear case where it's

639
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,560
not part of the protocol description so

640
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,880
I think that's something that you don't

641
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,160
have to confirm but this is what is the

642
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,540
true no it's not part of the foreign

643
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,920
like these three places please double

644
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,560
check I'm using hundreds of Greek

645
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,480
letters I don't want to see hundreds of

646
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,240
warnings well it should be one warning

647
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,060
so if you want to win one for each

648
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,359
liquid code Point used no like probably

649
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,220
it's enough to say like you use a unique

650
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,020
code Point somewhere in the text please

651
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,400
double check it's not part of the

652
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,140
product okay what I'm hearing is a

653
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,640
requirement that the tooling be able to

654
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,440
tell the authors if there's something to

655
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,359
pay attention to here and we can go

656
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,060
figure out what to do in the tooling

657
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,460
yeah also just Lars um you were talking

658
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,140
about math I'm guessing that a lot of

659
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,300
the math is an artwork or source code

660
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,680
and

661
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,480
the um you would guess wrong

662
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,820
there's math right but the the text then

663
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,660
uses the same variables as the the

664
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,339
artwork because it talks about what the

665
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,440
variables mean and that's where the the

666
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,660
alpha letters enter the

667
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,800
you know

668
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,440
got it okay so but this is also this is

669
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,339
a

670
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,560
oh no that's a PC no it's a proposed

671
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,720
standard now well okay if we get it

672
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,940
through but yes it will be a proposal

673
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,640
but it's a special case it is a special

674
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,200
case but this is sort of where we want

675
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,520
to get to right because we want to be

676
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,740
able to have the best possible way for

677
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,200
authors to describe the content and that

678
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,119
might mean a lot of Unicode for some

679
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,980
documents right okay

680
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,900
I mean it's something that doesn't give

681
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,520
me heartburns right now it might change

682
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,140
in like a couple of years

683
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,200
um

684
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,460
okay so my takeaway is that we can

685
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,680
discuss what the requirements are for if

686
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,040
we're going to add a tool yeah it does

687
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,140
sound as if the the focus here should be

688
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,300
on the readability of the document and

689
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,160
the interpretability of the document not

690
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,619
a specific set of rules about what is

691
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,780
displayed when and what is and and those

692
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,940
things and that that then comes back to

693
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,619
the authors and comes back to the ads

694
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:26,940
and others and

695
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,740
um ISE and others to check that

696
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,300
readability

697
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,160
um in the same way that it can be

698
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,619
affected by and you know ordinary Latin

699
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,540
characters ordinary Latin words can have

700
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,000
the same issues so I think if that's the

701
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,920
focus then the tooling can then support

702
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,140
that in many ways rather than us you

703
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,940
know getting stuck on the specifics of

704
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,619
having to use a u in every certain

705
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,540
circumstance and that sort of thing but

706
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,920
this is like this is the discussion we

707
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,260
need to have in the rswg right we need

708
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,579
to figure out how to handle these things

709
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,440
correctly in future and that's not where

710
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,940
we are right now

711
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,859
like for now we've just had to figure

712
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,260
out what the process is for now but sure

713
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,579
I thought we're talking about a separate

714
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,500
issue of authors being able to

715
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,359
understand what the

716
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,720
not the relation I'm confused

717
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,599
sorry say it again

718
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,920
sorry I thought we were talking about

719
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,800
how authors are going to work in

720
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,300
relation with the RPC uh you know in the

721
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,440
80s and others are going to be able to

722
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,500
track documents that have Unicode in it

723
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,420
but I don't see the relationship between

724
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,920
that and how that means we work with

725
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,359
rswg

726
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,400
yes so maybe I misunderstood your

727
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,300
comment what was your comment

728
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,480
two separate issues right one is the

729
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,660
very specific issue of giving authors

730
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,700
guidance of when they should use the you

731
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,920
tag which expands to this you know

732
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,740
Unicode and then parentheses what the

733
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,619
long name of that code point is

734
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,200
and and and the text currently says you

735
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,400
know when it's important for the

736
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,020
operation for protocol you should use

737
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,780
the U yes and and that is asking you

738
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,300
know can the stream approving bodies

739
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,339
review that you is being used

740
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,500
consistency like that and I said it's

741
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,359
going to be difficult right the other

742
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,599
issue is what do we what guidance should

743
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,359
authors have for using Unicode in

744
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,880
General within a YouTube that's the

745
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,920
question

746
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,660
rswg that's the question is

747
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,759
yes okay okay

748
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:32,099
always goes to the other question is

749
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,480
about the process so like just to

750
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,680
understand where you are I'm always

751
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,700
holding the center but I think his

752
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,260
author documents in this place so maybe

753
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,300
one of them speak you want to go to the

754
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,660
microphone

755
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,599
so I'm really going to try to do this as

756
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,420
questions not comments

757
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,339
um is there an expectation that the

758
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:51,540
rules are going to be different between

759
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,960
the streams

760
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,839
no bring this question to the rswg

761
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,540
oh I figured that that question was was

762
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,240
explicitly for here where the streams

763
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,440
are different

764
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,599
currently not because we're just trying

765
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,119
to interpret what's written in the RC

766
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,440
currently and that is very little

767
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,819
guidance and we will treat it the same

768
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,980
for all students right and then

769
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,440
okay this will be a comment not a

770
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,359
question but

771
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:21,540
the RFC doesn't say anything about this

772
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,859
this is all in the as is draft which

773
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:29,579
still has not been finalized and so my

774
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,980
question is are you okay with doing

775
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,280
something in whichever RFC to be is

776
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,460
using a rule that may end up getting

777
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,940
taken out of the as is that is it's as

778
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,579
is as of today but it hasn't actually

779
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,220
been instantiated and as we've seen

780
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,200
there's a lot of question of whether we

781
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,240
want to do this or not or whatever so

782
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,220
what's the alternative holding the RFC

783
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,220
no the alternative is to not use you

784
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,920
that is you might disappear but there

785
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,720
hasn't been an agreement in the

786
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,900
community that you is a good idea you is

787
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,579
part of as could be implemented so and

788
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,440
so so that's that's my question is is

789
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,020
are you okay with using you even though

790
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,480
it might not actually be implemented

791
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,940
anywhere else

792
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,440
that's where we are right now we have

793
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,560
rfcs published that use you I thought we

794
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,420
didn't have any already with you I

795
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,460
thought this was too big oh I'm sorry

796
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,740
okay totally wrong never mind ignore

797
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,319
that question two answers one I think we

798
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,700
were operating sort of under the general

799
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,960
principle and we should probably spell

800
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,160
it out that you know we want to try to

801
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,500
minimize differences between streams

802
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,480
um because it would be very confusing if

803
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,280
we did the opposite

804
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,839
um and and so I think that's the general

805
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,640
principle right and so and I don't see

806
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,520
this particular topic

807
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,740
well I can't see the reason why this

808
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,060
would differ between the streams right

809
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,560
and then the second thing yeah I think

810
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,540
we're you know if the

811
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,700
Community

812
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,619
consensus around what the tags are and

813
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,599
how to use changes we will follow along

814
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,560
right

815
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,579
um but at the moment we're sort of

816
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,560
trying to follow whatever we have

817
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,660
and the reason I was asking about the

818
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,880
streams is the current wording and the

819
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,060
as is document says in order to serve

820
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,160
characters in context that don't

821
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,460
explicitly allow Unicode and that could

822
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,079
be different between streams some

823
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,480
streams for example could say

824
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,520
that's going to be too confusing just

825
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,960
let it everywhere and other streams

826
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,420
would say we want to call it out so I'm

827
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,819
glad to hear that that may not happen

828
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,119
I I would expect the streams to try uh

829
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,900
to to stay aligned

830
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,020
thank you

831
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:46,619
sorry Paul I'm I don't believe that the

832
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,720
streams would have the ability to

833
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,160
override the RFC

834
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,680
and doesn't describe all the context so

835
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,960
I could believe different streams could

836
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,740
have a different question okay

837
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,740
um and just to an aside as far as I know

838
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,300
and I think as possibly as far as you

839
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,000
and John know this is the only example

840
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,540
of where the anaz is contradicted or

841
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,900
contradicts an RFC

842
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,920
there are lots of there are lots

843
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,660
you know this it's it got trod all over

844
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,060
are we good on three or four no no

845
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,440
um sorry for being optimistic like yeah

846
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,540
no sorry we have to get back to the pro

847
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,220
so like I'm checking where we are so we

848
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,339
the the we gave advice to the RPC the

849
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,619
tooling was um updated in line with the

850
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:54,839
existing RFC was the tooling change

851
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,980
announced to the artist WG as well

852
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,359
oh where was I don't know

853
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,500
okay

854
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,839
okay but there's obviously there is a

855
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,520
policy issue so somebody should bring it

856
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,859
to the IRS which is at least sort of

857
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:23,779
forwarded to the rswg list

858
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,420
it should be sent to the RSW yeah I mean

859
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,339
like actually

860
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,500
yes

861
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,680
sorry said I didn't hear

862
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,680
it's a decision made by rsat that needs

863
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,560
to be communicated to rswg we it's not

864
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,359
the tooling change that needs to be yeah

865
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,099
so I'm just I'm just asking what happens

866
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,660
if I just want to understand where we

867
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,060
are yes uh so that's also what I wanted

868
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,380
to say I don't think it's good to have

869
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,700
these tooling announcements without any

870
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,500
context so we should actually raise an

871
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,859
issue and actually my understanding from

872
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,900
the process would be it would be the RPC

873
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,060
rating this issue with uh like we would

874
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,740
advise the RPC to raise the issue with

875
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,740
CRST

876
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,700
I can check the document if you want but

877
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,740
I think just when we make decisions for

878
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,780
transparency sake and just so that no

879
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,900
you know principally surprised we should

880
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,780
inform the rswg of our of our decision

881
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,980
process

882
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,440
but that's Elliott's opinion I can go

883
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,940
look at the draft and see what it says

884
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,579
or the rfcs

885
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:27,960
do you remember which section I'm trying

886
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,380
to find it now

887
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,760
yeah me neither

888
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,400
but so somebody's getting an action item

889
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,359
to

890
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:45,240
forward the decision announcement to the

891
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,859
rswg

892
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:48,780
because I want to submit near you so

893
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,220
let's raise the issue and I don't think

894
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,560
that's accurate right because race the

895
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,880
issue sounds like we are invading

896
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,500
discussion on this

897
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,319
with which we don't right

898
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,180
no I think what we should describe is

899
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,740
not only we should not only say that

900
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,359
there was a tooling update based on a

901
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,520
decision that the um ourselves made but

902
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,260
we should also say that there's a policy

903
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,579
question that needs to be addressed and

904
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,680
what this policy question is I think

905
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,300
that would be more useful

906
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,000
okay so what is the policy question

907
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,700
um policy question is how to handle EU

908
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,020
like how to give better advice to

909
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,000
authors like what's the actual way to

910
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,920
handle the the unique code and using the

911
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,859
use okay so basically um

912
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:28,200
related to the RFC to be

913
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,480
yes yes and

914
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,920
and

915
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,240
you figure out the question who who

916
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,200
works what to whom but

917
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:38,940
but like just a very quick prescription

918
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,440
about what we did and what the policy

919
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,560
problem is to the mailing distance

920
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,240
here's what the problem was here's what

921
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,940
the you know was done with this is

922
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,960
another person when he was a tooling

923
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,520
change that happened and then we can

924
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,619
figure out who exactly sends it where I

925
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:56,060
don't think that's a big problem okay

926
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:58,859
does make sense to everybody

927
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:02,779
okay then we can move on make it so

928
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,460
and the next one was just excuse me I

929
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,920
just I caught the text actually in 9280.

930
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,079
all right here's what it says if there's

931
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:22,020
a disagree it's couch in the term

932
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,880
disagreement but it says in this case

933
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,579
the r the rsab is responsible for a

934
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:28,920
resolving the disagreement in a timely

935
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,079
manner if necessary so that the relevant

936
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,640
stream documents can be published before

937
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,339
a new policy is defined and B

938
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:38,400
bringing the issue to the rswg so that a

939
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,079
new policy can be defined that's in

940
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,920
section 4.4

941
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,480
so in an answer to Ecker I think the

942
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,940
rsab should collectively say are bad

943
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,140
we have to actually make the decision to

944
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,520
document this decision and then reach

945
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,800
out afterwards we would do that I don't

946
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,720
think I'm linked this Timely

947
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,460
if you need a decision a month ago and

948
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,599
you're telling us now and you haven't

949
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,099
even told us yet that's not Timely

950
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,059
no but I mean the decision is taken

951
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:17,760
right we don't inform you

952
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,339
loving that I think we could have been

953
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:23,280
more uh we could even faster with

954
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,460
informing the rswg I think that's yes

955
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,619
do so going forward but so we're

956
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,420
informing them after after the decision

957
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,040
was taken and I don't think in this case

958
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,240
it makes any difference when we're

959
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,559
executing from them we could have been

960
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,880
faster but it doesn't make a difference

961
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,760
it certainly does

962
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,000
um so like let's stop this or let's stop

963
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,099
this RC going going to last being

964
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,920
published in the time period right

965
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,300
like the decision was made when you

966
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,460
instruct it when you instructed the the

967
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,960
tools team to make the change that's

968
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,579
when the decision was made because there

969
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,319
was an RC in the queue that was waiting

970
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,760
for this change right and so what I'm

971
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,640
saying at the same time we could have

972
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,319
already informed the article but like

973
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,819
what's the difference we should have

974
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:08,880
because that's what the family needs yes

975
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,339
but it's like

976
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:14,040
Growing Pains of a new structure and

977
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,740
will strive to do better in the future I

978
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,300
I think there's something important

979
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,880
about this is because the RSV is

980
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,920
extremely low operating parameters which

981
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,859
are designed to do exactly two things to

982
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:28,020
approve the output of the rswg

983
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,359
and to in cases like this to make

984
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,240
changes in a little rswg they're not an

985
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,800
independent body which makes policy

986
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,500
about this no like we don't and so part

987
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,420
of that part of the lower parameters are

988
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,579
notifying the rs.ud at a timely fashion

989
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:44,480
when you make those decisions

990
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,859
yes we have I think we just have a

991
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:48,180
different interpretation of timely

992
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,800
because this is like a matter of a few

993
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,300
weeks right and we are we are we're

994
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,859
organizing this meeting so we have this

995
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:54,900
meeting to actually document in our

996
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,400
minutes that we discussed this issue and

997
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,660
this is the right time to reach out to

998
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,640
the rswg and like I don't really

999
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,140
understand your point because like

1000
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,640
informing you like three weeks earlier

1001
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,260
wouldn't really change anything right

1002
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,720
because the hours WG is also not

1003
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,940
operating on a daily basis

1004
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,040
it's not about it's not only about

1005
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,180
whether it would have changed something

1006
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,760
it's also about the what what

1007
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,400
um impression does it set or what does

1008
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,920
it give right because I don't I don't

1009
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,780
know one of the concerns that led to the

1010
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,160
creation of the structure was that the r

1011
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,599
stock was very in transparent and did

1012
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,099
stuff and the community wasn't involved

1013
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,559
and the community decided on a process

1014
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,940
where

1015
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,000
um as Echo said right the rswg is the

1016
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,160
the debating body and we are the

1017
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,540
approval body and we have a little bit

1018
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,980
of mandate to

1019
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,440
do things because otherwise the queue

1020
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,780
stops and and this was a case where the

1021
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,740
queue would have stopped for this

1022
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,240
document and so we did a decision but

1023
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,500
that the

1024
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,440
I think implied immediate ask at the

1025
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,200
same time is to take it to the rswg and

1026
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,119
immediately immediate is not the same as

1027
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:58,339
timely Robert so

1028
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:00,540
it seems like there's just some

1029
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,000
disagreement or confusion about what

1030
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,700
timely means here and I think what we

1031
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,020
probably need to do at this point is

1032
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,480
write down what our expectations are and

1033
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,700
get agreements on them so we understand

1034
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,920
what timely actually means in this case

1035
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,960
and whether that's within a day whether

1036
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,059
that's within a month or a week or

1037
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,339
whatever it is I think just we can take

1038
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,079
the request that you know the reaction

1039
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,180
that we're seeing here is is that um

1040
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,040
over communication is likely to hurt

1041
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,319
less than under communication

1042
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,260
so absolutely absolutely yes but I think

1043
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,119
it's also wrong expectation we're not

1044
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,859
like not in this group and also not in

1045
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:36,960
the rswg we're working on any kind of

1046
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,520
Daily Business I mean like this was

1047
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,339
blocking something uh in a queue right

1048
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:43,319
so we made a decision but anything that

1049
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:45,839
follows is a much longer timeline but I

1050
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,880
don't see what the urgency is and I

1051
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,280
would much rather have these things put

1052
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,140
up on a meeting agenda and put them in

1053
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,059
the meeting minutes and have them

1054
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,099
documented right correctly and then

1055
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,900
Reach Out rather than doing something on

1056
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,940
on a haste without need

1057
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,940
the difficulty is though that the tools

1058
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,339
implementation took place some weeks ago

1059
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:08,760
so we have the decision made tools

1060
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,740
implementation and then a significant

1061
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,559
time before the rswg is told that that

1062
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:14,880
that's the issue if we've made the

1063
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,440
decision and nothing had happened with

1064
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,440
it I can understand then you know the

1065
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,700
only reason why we made a timely

1066
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,020
decision is because something had to

1067
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,940
happen about it yes absolutely yes and

1068
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,460
so that I think I'm saying we have now

1069
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,200
made a decision that affects the tools

1070
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,700
implementation and this will be done at

1071
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,220
its own so time is something that needs

1072
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,319
to be passed on to rswg

1073
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,500
you know the timely to mean means that

1074
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,700
they know that the the tools

1075
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,079
implementation is coming or has just

1076
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,780
happened some so but you're saying if if

1077
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,099
we should have informed them before the

1078
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:45,599
tools change

1079
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,040
um happened this is gives them a chance

1080
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,000
to interview them

1081
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:54,780
but why is it important that it happens

1082
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,040
quickly because the policy

1083
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,859
implementation implications will not be

1084
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:01,020
decided tomorrow

1085
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,660
we we've had a situation where the RSO

1086
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,880
was doing things and it wasn't

1087
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,079
transparent and the community didn't

1088
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,900
like that and and there there might be

1089
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,819
fear that the rset is moving in the same

1090
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:14,220
direction and we need to offset that but

1091
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,040
the transparency

1092
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,559
and not tell the community for a while

1093
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,339
right it's it's a pattern that the asok

1094
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,020
used to have they're delayed for much

1095
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,300
longer and sometimes never told right

1096
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,760
but but it's the community expects

1097
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,920
transparency and expects it in a timely

1098
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,460
manner and in this case I think you know

1099
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,619
reasonably so we didn't deliver because

1100
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:39,900
we took too long to let them know even

1101
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,579
if they wouldn't have started work until

1102
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:43,619
this meeting or next meeting it's about

1103
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,359
when did the information get passed out

1104
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,880
of the RSA

1105
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,700
I mean I don't think it matters what the

1106
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,859
rswg would do with this knowledge is

1107
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:54,780
that you know we have committed to

1108
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,700
release it so we should do so in a

1109
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,980
timely manner we we should agree what

1110
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,700
timely means

1111
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,800
can I just suggest perhaps that we just

1112
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,300
have a little bit of formalism around

1113
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,520
what a published decision is

1114
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,160
um because then and then that formalism

1115
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,720
that publish thing is what goes to the

1116
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,000
tall scene what goes to rswg what goes

1117
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,460
to the RPC you know and then everybody

1118
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,260
then gets it at the same time and then

1119
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,520
implements at the same time so it's

1120
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,500
transparency that way because what it

1121
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,300
could feel like to some people is that

1122
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,920
we made a published decision we sent it

1123
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,540
to the RPC and sent it the tools team

1124
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,780
and deliberately didn't send it to rswg

1125
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,400
which isn't the case obviously we all

1126
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,859
forgot you know but um it could look

1127
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,780
like that so that's why you know I'm

1128
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,940
just suggesting a bit more formalism

1129
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,400
yeah but this is I mean this is a

1130
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,240
problem that we don't have this

1131
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,980
formality about the decisions and I was

1132
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,900
hoping we actually use the meeting and

1133
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,280
the and that and having it on the

1134
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,540
meeting agenda and then putting meeting

1135
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,160
minutes in to have like this formal

1136
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,280
decision recorded right I mean I I would

1137
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,260
argue that we could say that this

1138
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,880
meeting is the point where we make the

1139
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,079
decision

1140
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,339
um if we're going to make decisions

1141
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,440
between meetings then we should have a

1142
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,940
schedule for

1143
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,920
you know maybe set up a schedule of

1144
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,839
calls or something with minutes and that

1145
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,540
you know have prescribed times where we

1146
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,920
document outcomes

1147
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,940
is this meeting

1148
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,920
so maybe that is this meeting but if

1149
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,819
we're trying to do it in between

1150
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:19,740
meetings we need to be perhaps a little

1151
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,419
more formal about how we do that

1152
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:26,700
um so the because we are we can only

1153
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,440
take action when there's an immediate

1154
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,900
need right and and that means by

1155
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,640
definition these are things that cannot

1156
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,619
wait until the next rsat meeting right

1157
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,960
and the decision was taken the test

1158
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,760
decision was taken right the decision is

1159
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,500
so so we decided to take a decision

1160
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,099
right and and at that point we took a

1161
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:47,220
decision and and we we caused tools to

1162
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,559
change and then we should have informed

1163
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,200
ours with other ug around that same time

1164
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,540
which is now because it was three weeks

1165
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,180
ago or four no the four weeks is not

1166
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,599
timely okay I don't so I think we're

1167
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:02,880
going around in circles yeah we do so

1168
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,299
let's let's pause for a moment and

1169
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:08,940
um my suggestion is we clearly have a

1170
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,040
decision process issue on our side let's

1171
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,599
think about it

1172
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:15,480
in the meantime as if we have other

1173
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,059
decisions to make let's make sure at

1174
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:19,920
least in an ad hoc fashion that they're

1175
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,140
spread widely is as quickly as possible

1176
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,359
and then let's sort a proposal for how

1177
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:26,700
we do our decision process that way

1178
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,619
maybe we can move forward now I like

1179
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:30,599
Jay's proposal of basically having a a

1180
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:33,900
formal decision point and then we can

1181
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,540
tee off different actions of that

1182
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,480
yeah I think that good a proposal we

1183
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,359
should figure out how to I mean I would

1184
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,339
argue that we should probably describe

1185
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:47,339
what what we would consider timely to be

1186
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:49,920
and then if if they arrest the beauty

1187
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,599
disagrees with that we can at least have

1188
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,400
a discussion

1189
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,559
so so we're setting expectations

1190
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:01,200
my suggestion was in an attempt to take

1191
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,660
away worrying about what timely is by

1192
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,460
saying that when we think we've made a

1193
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,160
decision we write it up as anything and

1194
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,380
that it's a it's a document whatever

1195
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,599
some kind of structure and that is what

1196
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:15,240
is sent to the RPC to you know to the

1197
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,220
tools team if required anti-rswg so

1198
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,380
there is just a thing and nothing

1199
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,299
happens until we've agreed that document

1200
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:22,740
and once we've read it it's published

1201
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,440
everyone can have it

1202
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,380
that that also works

1203
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,299
it seems like kind of a little bit of

1204
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:31,740
overhead for me but we definitely should

1205
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,900
have more structure around this we might

1206
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,339
need that ballot support earlier than we

1207
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:37,859
thought but that's just Society do you

1208
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:40,500
really want to ballot on on any kind of

1209
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,260
these kind of decisions well I mean yes

1210
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,819
right because we need a document that we

1211
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:46,500
came to an agreement in some form and

1212
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,839
that but I have a record

1213
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:50,339
um

1214
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:52,020
and at the moment at the moment we're

1215
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,520
doing this by email and that's fine too

1216
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,500
but but that's exactly what like I think

1217
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,819
how we need to record that we made

1218
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,760
decisions on the r set

1219
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,799
I thought the way that we reported it is

1220
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:04,740
or like the the point of time is the

1221
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,420
meeting where we record things and then

1222
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,040
we take for the action someday but

1223
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,359
anyway

1224
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,799
um if we delay the action until the

1225
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,660
meeting no we didn't delay the action we

1226
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,180
didn't exactly but if we so the only we

1227
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,559
can only say that the meeting is the

1228
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:21,839
time when we do these actions if we

1229
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,760
actually wait until the meeting

1230
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,520
but because we are only supposed to take

1231
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,799
actions when there's an immediate need

1232
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,720
I don't see how we can delay things

1233
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,640
until the next meeting and still say we

1234
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,780
need to take immediate action and

1235
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,420
settlement for two months because sort

1236
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,200
of

1237
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,359
okay let me actually take an action item

1238
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,859
to work on a proposal how this process

1239
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:42,480
should look like and then we have the

1240
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,460
discussion on the mailing list

1241
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,140
I think everybody who's not on the rsap

1242
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,460
quickly

1243
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,260
um

1244
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,119
is uh reconsidering whether you want to

1245
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,380
attend future meetings because these

1246
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,559
discussions

1247
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,880
at least you get lunch out of it and a

1248
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,819
painful discussion about how it is the

1249
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:02,900
lunch wasn't enough of a draw

1250
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,099
great first decision we take when we

1251
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:06,839
don't know the process

1252
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:07,619
um okay

1253
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:10,140
uh that was not unexpected okay let's

1254
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,880
move on

1255
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,520
okay so the rest is uh just check-ins

1256
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,359
it's

1257
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,740
um wanting to see if any of the street

1258
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,780
managers had any concerns or comments

1259
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,059
feedback about how the inclusive

1260
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:24,420
language process is working or how the

1261
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,680
auth48 archive is working

1262
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,079
uh so as far as I can tell the of 48

1263
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,760
archive is working fine and it's

1264
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,700
completely invisible to everyone apart

1265
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,339
from people who go search it out

1266
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:43,319
um inclusive language seems to be

1267
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:44,760
working fine

1268
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,280
um every time traditional gets flagged

1269
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,720
up someone asks the question about why

1270
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,319
that is we may need to provide some more

1271
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:54,000
guidance for that but other than that

1272
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,099
yeah it seems to be working fine from my

1273
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:57,180
point of view

1274
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,980
okay so maybe we haven't been doing a

1275
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,000
good job I thought we were trying to

1276
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,079
frame it as a Clarity issue it is a

1277
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,940
Clarity issue but if everyone says why

1278
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,859
why traditional

1279
01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:10,559
people don't understand why this is a

1280
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,180
problem

1281
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,480
Okay so we've been trying to point to

1282
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,700
the document so it's it's flagged in the

1283
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,760
nist document and there's an explanation

1284
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,460
in the table so maybe we may just need

1285
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,960
to point to that more directly or make

1286
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,700
it more prominent about why I think in

1287
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,280
this case uh you know some of the other

1288
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,160
cases people understand intuitively why

1289
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,900
this is being flagged up but that's one

1290
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,099
that people don't seem to understand

1291
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:38,220
intuitively uh so we may need to point

1292
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,319
to you know explicit chapter of verse

1293
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,180
you know subsection 4.2 of the next

1294
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,980
document because people don't seem to

1295
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,640
find it

1296
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,240
yeah

1297
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,099
um the Middle Point again so we talked

1298
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,079
about this with the isg on on Sunday so

1299
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,819
we should maybe take it out of the isg

1300
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:54,780
Sunday since we're going to talk about

1301
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,099
it here which is the more appropriate

1302
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,859
Forum uh similar to call an all-48 works

1303
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:00,900
great air directors really rely on it

1304
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,180
already we can produce it makes it easy

1305
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,579
to send a link to somebody to point them

1306
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:07,200
at a specific comment that was made

1307
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,400
during affiliate if it wasn't possible

1308
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,299
before

1309
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:11,520
inclusive language seems to work fine

1310
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,500
um the the only thing we talked about is

1311
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,579
on Sunday I'm just mentioning it here

1312
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:16,559
for those of you who weren't there

1313
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,280
um

1314
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,799
I I think the language that you're using

1315
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,380
uh is fine in the sense that you are

1316
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,059
it's very clear to me at least that

1317
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:26,040
you're trying to suggest to authors that

1318
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,920
they review the use of those terms

1319
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,540
um and but some authors seem to

1320
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,880
misunderstand it as uh you know the RFC

1321
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,920
that told me to change this words and

1322
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,859
how dare they or or I don't understand

1323
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:39,660
um I don't know if these these things

1324
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,460
can be further clarified I think it's a

1325
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,020
very small fraction of authors that is

1326
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,720
confused in this way but um it is a

1327
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,880
thing right and and

1328
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,160
thank you

1329
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,420
so if there's if there's better words

1330
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,299
that you could put in in the the first

1331
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:56,460
paragraph of this thing

1332
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,260
um but um let me make a suggestion I

1333
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,720
think one point is like that people

1334
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,460
um don't don't see it as like a request

1335
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,380
to review but it requires to change but

1336
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,380
you know that's I think so that's your

1337
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,760
point right I think that's actually very

1338
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,079
clear in the wording people just don't

1339
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,119
understand it but the other point is

1340
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:14,040
that um not all of these works and

1341
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,420
that's written in this document but

1342
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,859
nobody clicks on that and reads in this

1343
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:18,720
document right so not all of these words

1344
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,640
are like necessarily extremely like

1345
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,040
exclusive or whatever but some of them

1346
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,900
are just like because of cultural

1347
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,079
references are not clear and by

1348
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,420
increasing Clarity here you can be more

1349
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,400
inclusive and you can maybe phrase it in

1350
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,740
that way that like the purpose is also

1351
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,380
to increase Clarity because it might not

1352
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,700
so like if you add one more sentence

1353
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,900
explaining

1354
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,640
they're not all the words are the same

1355
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,140
or that this this is part of the purpose

1356
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,960
that could help

1357
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,900
okay so we will review the language that

1358
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,079
we're using but the the language that

1359
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,780
we're using we were trying to rely on

1360
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:57,119
the examples or the definitions that

1361
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,559
were provided in the nist document which

1362
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,200
is why we point to the table that

1363
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,900
um yeah I totally understood that this

1364
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,579
document is like very broad right like

1365
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:08,640
if you look at some maybe other

1366
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,700
um documents they specifically focus on

1367
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,339
The Words which are somehow but that was

1368
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:16,160
not what the community wanted

1369
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,299
no no I'm not discussing this document

1370
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:19,740
I'm just saying that there's like a set

1371
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,299
of words where people understand they

1372
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:23,700
are kind of exclusive because they have

1373
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,440
like a very specific wording in there

1374
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,359
but then this document is much broader

1375
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,559
than that and has like a lot of words

1376
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,660
which are just like unclear because of

1377
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,460
cultural references and that's something

1378
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,680
that I don't think is clear to people so

1379
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,599
spelling that out why this document is

1380
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:38,099
so broad like adding a sentence to it

1381
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:40,579
might help

1382
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,380
okay I guess I had taken it for granted

1383
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,880
that that was a given because the

1384
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,440
community adopted the nist document

1385
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,440
obviously not yes

1386
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,420
so

1387
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,859
we need to be careful here right because

1388
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:54,960
the community was very clear that they

1389
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,940
wanted to use in this document and if we

1390
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,000
now start to interpret

1391
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,059
the next document and in a paragraph in

1392
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:05,280
the email we are we are down the path

1393
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,140
just slightly but we are down the path

1394
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,299
of our giving our own guidance but I

1395
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:10,920
think that this document has warnings

1396
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,539
around that that the list document is

1397
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:14,640
Broad because it tries to be to increase

1398
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,859
Clarity so if you can use that wording

1399
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:18,660
instead of just like points in this

1400
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,579
document actually put it one more

1401
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:22,980
sentence in there that might help

1402
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,319
but I mean it's so I've liked these as

1403
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:27,839
part of my ad reviews all right um or I

1404
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,599
try to and and I tried to say the same

1405
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:32,819
thing you know it's an ask for review

1406
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:34,859
and if somebody says I reviewed it and I

1407
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:37,079
think this usage is fine I'm very happy

1408
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:39,180
to accept that right

1409
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,319
um

1410
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,480
but but I think it's I think it's very

1411
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,980
clear what you have I don't know if it

1412
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:47,160
can be improved if you can think of a

1413
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,780
way that would be great

1414
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:51,000
um but I think we are already at the

1415
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,500
point where there's a very small

1416
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,319
fraction of authors that

1417
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,460
misunderstand what they're being asked

1418
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,339
to do right and so

1419
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:02,099
okay so like I said we'll review

1420
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:03,420
um and see if

1421
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,000
if we can do uh maybe ask the individual

1422
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,339
which words would have been clearer and

1423
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:10,020
uh we'll see if they will be generally

1424
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,640
more clear or just individually more

1425
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,240
clear and

1426
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,339
okay the new another thing for the IB

1427
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:20,339
there that's that's it also

1428
01:08:20,339 --> 01:08:23,580
um I don't think trying trying to get to

1429
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,319
the stage where no one is confused about

1430
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,779
this is a realistic goal there's always

1431
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,880
going to be a few

1432
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,160
no I don't yeah I don't think we can we

1433
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,238
can try but I don't think it's super

1434
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:34,679
important like if you take the text that

1435
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:36,120
it is that's fine as well I just brought

1436
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,859
it up because as usual when terminology

1437
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:40,380
gets brought up it caused a repeated

1438
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,960
discussion of the whole terminology

1439
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,759
thing and um

1440
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:47,000
um

1441
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,140
but thanks for doing it

1442
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,759
okay

1443
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,198
um the last one is actually something we

1444
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,140
could probably just talk to Maria about

1445
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,640
um and really it was just there's some

1446
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,560
guidance that the IAB provided to us a

1447
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,080
while ago that outlined some

1448
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,460
details about how the different

1449
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,738
documents should be formatted and some

1450
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:10,319
of the documents recently there were

1451
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,759
some updates that were pretty time

1452
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,020
consuming and so we were just wondering

1453
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,960
if there's a way that we can update yeah

1454
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,299
we definitely should um I just wasn't

1455
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:21,120
sure so you said the the IV was writing

1456
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,198
this document and providing it to you

1457
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:23,640
it's most not wasn't you writing the

1458
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,679
document and then agreeing with CIP so

1459
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,479
your expectation is that the iub is

1460
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,279
updating the document or do you want to

1461
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,899
propose updates as a document of the IEP

1462
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:32,640
I think we have some proposals for you

1463
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,819
and then we can figure out let's do that

1464
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,439
I think the IP would be very happy about

1465
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,099
that okay

1466
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,679
um that's all that we had on the agenda

1467
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,020
for today so unless anyone has any other

1468
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,520
topics or questions for us

1469
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,120
this is any other business and Elliott

1470
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,460
has another business yeah just not to

1471
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:14,880
try and solve the problem today but for

1472
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,280
those who hadn't noticed there was a

1473
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,860
neurotom opened

1474
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,800
um on a

1475
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,179
uh it was jeez it was an obsoleted IAB

1476
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:30,540
document that was I think update who's

1477
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:34,620
whose document that did the obsolete

1478
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,500
um was updated by RFC 9280

1479
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,260
but it opened a a bit of a question

1480
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,600
which is if we have if there are any IAB

1481
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,020
documents that touch on rfcs that

1482
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,699
weren't updated

1483
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:50,460
there may be a need to one of the things

1484
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,920
we didn't cover in 9280 was how to

1485
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,340
handle their autumn and um there are

1486
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,440
audits so I don't have a specific

1487
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,540
suggestion I'm not even sure if it's a

1488
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,239
real problem yet uh because this was

1489
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:07,920
such a peculiar erotic itself but that

1490
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,580
um

1491
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,500
this wasn't a relative to an obsolete

1492
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,960
document yeah don't they get rejected

1493
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,460
because it's an absolute document anyway

1494
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,560
right well

1495
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,280
so in in be that as May one thing we

1496
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,620
should just keep keep an eye out for is

1497
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,179
whether or not

1498
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,000
the the rswg

1499
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
should has anything to do there in terms

1500
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,020
of providing a policy for updating

1501
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:36,719
Errata of these sorts of things I'm not

1502
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,020
sure there is yet but it was a things

1503
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,880
happened pretty quickly was it last week

1504
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,040
two weeks ago and I just want to make

1505
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,739
sure we don't you know we have we have

1506
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:48,840
in fact informed people what we did and

1507
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,100
who did what

1508
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,380
so earlier I don't think it is formally

1509
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,540
obsolete I think it's implicitly

1510
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,480
obsolete by the new model possibly but I

1511
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,860
don't think it's formally obsoleted

1512
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:02,040
because the new model didn't

1513
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,199
um follow the path backwards of

1514
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:07,199
boilerplates to see what documents are

1515
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,780
updated By changes that it made yeah so

1516
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,940
this is the boilerplate document give me

1517
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,340
just a moment I'll bring it up

1518
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,440
so just so I understand the question is

1519
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,320
whether the IAB should handle these

1520
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,739
changes assets of the rswg or so this

1521
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:26,580
had to do with RFC 5741

1522
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,679
and there was some text in there that

1523
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,300
said

1524
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,060
um about about how how and when how

1525
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,880
boilerplate is meant to be used and a

1526
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,739
correction was proposed

1527
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:41,760
now if I go to so that that specific

1528
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,320
area was deleted because it was a

1529
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,239
duplicate from an existing editor that

1530
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:46,620
was verified at some point like that

1531
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,480
this whole is hold for a document update

1532
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,300
I think so this error is not our problem

1533
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,159
at the moment but it's a more general

1534
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:54,840
question about error tests that are

1535
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,520
raised against

1536
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,060
um iob documents that Define the ROC

1537
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,620
process because and like I think it's

1538
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,140
it's an even broader question about

1539
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,020
um what like we we also had a discussion

1540
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,480
about the XML format like how much does

1541
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,940
does the IB need to agree to obsolete

1542
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,320
these documents right so what's the

1543
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,320
what's the role for the IEP if any for

1544
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,179
these existing rfcs that are part of the

1545
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:21,000
IB stream that is the question I have

1546
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,600
um

1547
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,480
and we actually looked at that that came

1548
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,420
up in the working group previously yeah

1549
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,520
right and we chose to defer that

1550
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,640
question specifically so

1551
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,360
um

1552
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,739
uh this is something the rswg might want

1553
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:39,719
to put a little energy into at some

1554
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:42,780
point uh just to see which documents the

1555
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,520
the editorial need to be in the

1556
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,199
editorial series and under editorial

1557
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:48,300
stream control

1558
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,000
um going forward I don't have any

1559
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,659
specific suggestions as to which ones at

1560
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:57,120
this point it's just uh there may be a

1561
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,400
little work hiding there a different

1562
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,620
suggestion and that's maybe a bit more

1563
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,960
pragmatic in the sense that

1564
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,760
um so there's a bunch of documents in

1565
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,620
that are historically in the IAB and

1566
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,060
they talked about previous RFC editor

1567
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,260
models that are not in effect anymore

1568
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,420
and frankly I don't care who proves the

1569
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,560
rather for those or not approve them

1570
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,480
because they don't change anything

1571
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,820
right because if I have the other model

1572
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,920
2 you know if you prove around us all

1573
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,659
you want is not going to change how RCS

1574
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:23,159
are produced no but I mean this is the

1575
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:23,880
document

1576
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,520
stream

1577
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,320
that wasn't done yet right so for

1578
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,140
documents on the IB stream

1579
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,580
um that

1580
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,300
still impact how rfcs get produced and

1581
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,179
how the IFC process works

1582
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:42,420
right I would expect the RPC where they

1583
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,860
get raised

1584
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:47,040
to bring them to the r sub

1585
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,659
because

1586
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:50,940
I thought as far as I remember and maybe

1587
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,860
I'm wrong here but it's it's not the RSL

1588
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,360
ugu it's the stream improving body for

1589
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,739
the electronic screen with the r step

1590
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:58,040
right

1591
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,340
because the stream improving body

1592
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,620
decides only around us

1593
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,880
yeah and currently they come

1594
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,260
and they can

1595
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,060
make questions you have to do is like to

1596
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,980
name a set of RCs where these erratus

1597
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,800
goes should go somewhere else

1598
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,260
right so so the the error get raised to

1599
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,860
the RPC if these are IAB stream

1600
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:25,380
documents that still affect how RCS get

1601
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,540
produced and how the process works

1602
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,300
the

1603
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,820
rsap should be the approving yeah so not

1604
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,980
the IAB and the iib needs to agree to

1605
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,260
that that's a question

1606
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,860
a what are

1607
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,519
uh

1608
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,920
get filed because it's not happening

1609
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,600
very often and I don't see the need to

1610
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,760
like do busy work now as long as we

1611
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,320
agree that that the IB will basically

1612
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,260
delegate this going forward

1613
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,420
yeah I think I would suggest that the ID

1614
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,820
simply just delegate it and totally

1615
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,679
effectively and

1616
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:02,760
um you know you could choose to

1617
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,020
undelegate at any time but you just say

1618
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,760
once last year are sad and then our

1619
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,140
samples and we'll sign off on it and

1620
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:10,260
they don't do any processes

1621
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,440
um okay uh okay so I will bring it back

1622
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,900
to the IRB and um

1623
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,239
try to get this minute minute somewhere

1624
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,460
so just one comment the benefit of

1625
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,260
naming the set of rfcs is helpful

1626
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,640
because we could just

1627
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,400
noted assign the

1628
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,560
um approvers to be the all right we're

1629
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,300
gonna we're gonna build a list of rfcs

1630
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,640
incrementally as Iran has come in and we

1631
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,620
realize this is one where you know it's

1632
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,260
on the IRB stream it still has an effect

1633
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,060
um so it should be uh the i7 will be

1634
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,679
added to the list and we need to figure

1635
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,719
out where we maintain this list I'm just

1636
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,460
basically trying to not have us do the

1637
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,380
work of comp trying to compile this list

1638
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,580
now

1639
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,080
um I would rather do it like in response

1640
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,120
to rather coming in okay which probably

1641
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,679
means we never have a complete list but

1642
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:53,820
that's okay

1643
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:54,540
um

1644
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,140
okay

1645
01:16:57,239 --> 01:16:59,400
okay that sounds

1646
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,020
um like a good approach to me as I said

1647
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,880
I will bring it back to the IEP and try

1648
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,159
to minute it in the ibmits

1649
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,260
um is that something we need to inform

1650
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,820
the rswg about

1651
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,179
I think it would be nice of us to send

1652
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:17,640
that there not because I think they have

1653
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,060
any say here really but I think because

1654
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,380
it's a wrinkle in the process that we've

1655
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,880
not clarify it and I think it's it's

1656
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,800
worthwhile for degree to understand what

1657
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,360
the clarification is I mean definitely

1658
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,280
yes so but like we will have it in our

1659
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,860
minutes now right our minutes are public

1660
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,540
are we expecting people to just read our

1661
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,219
minutes or are we actually reaching

1662
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:37,380
actively out to the rswg for all these

1663
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,340
kind of things

1664
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,500
I would say email is cheap and I mean we

1665
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,560
can send our minutes to the list right

1666
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,460
rather than them having to like find

1667
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,440
them on the website or wherever they go

1668
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,659
um and and you know whether we send an

1669
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:50,400
extra email or we forward the the

1670
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,679
minutes to them I don't know

1671
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:54,360
if we don't forward the minutes already

1672
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,139
you probably should anyway

1673
01:17:57,659 --> 01:17:59,159
um Cindy we probably don't forward the

1674
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:01,639
minutes right

1675
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,620
we didn't for the first step but I can

1676
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,780
do that going forward do we want to do

1677
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,699
that

1678
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:11,040
okay perfect

1679
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:11,880
thank you

1680
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,900
for the minutes

1681
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,060
committed to public it was approved by

1682
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,400
email because the only other meeting you

1683
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,800
guys had was in July so I mean

1684
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,140
presumably what the process is you'll do

1685
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,340
the same thing this time they'll approve

1686
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,840
them by email and once it's approved and

1687
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,340
posted to the data tracker I can just

1688
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,980
send an announcement to rswg yep

1689
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,280
let's do that okay

1690
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,280
and it is an aob but I'll wait for the

1691
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,140
OB to happen

1692
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,860
I have an aob item okay are we

1693
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,239
I think we're good on this one right

1694
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:47,100
we've um no sir I have no question and

1695
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,659
there's this um broader policy question

1696
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:51,120
about also kind of does the IB have to

1697
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,980
agree if those documents gets obsoleted

1698
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,320
or updated or whatever I think that is

1699
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,640
this question that should be raised with

1700
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,500
the rswg and I'm not sure if there's an

1701
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,140
issue on the RS um WG already so I think

1702
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,120
it's a related question and I think sort

1703
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,120
of morally iib has sort of given away

1704
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,060
the control of the of the RFC editor

1705
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:12,000
right and so I think similar to how they

1706
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,760
would you know they should delegate the

1707
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,980
um a rather approval to the rsf they for

1708
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,360
those other documents on their IEP

1709
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:21,000
stream they should also delegate uh

1710
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,340
decision on updates or obsoletations

1711
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,920
through the RS app because so the the

1712
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,179
principle if you look at it in other

1713
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,400
ways like under the current model these

1714
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,540
documents would have been published on

1715
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,940
the editorial stream right because

1716
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,400
that's like where they would go going

1717
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,140
forward and so we're trying to sort of

1718
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:39,659
like grandfather them in sorry for using

1719
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:42,300
that term somehow and uh and so the IB

1720
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,340
basically should I mean yes they should

1721
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,600
I'm just asking about the process

1722
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,219
because I mean at the end that's an even

1723
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:48,600
broader question like how do we

1724
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,699
generally handle the process is like uh

1725
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:52,679
one stream updates or obsolete document

1726
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:54,719
from another stream

1727
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,400
because that's also it's not the only

1728
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,940
case here

1729
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,280
we've retrospectively changed the stream

1730
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,980
of these rfcs you you might be able to

1731
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,540
but I guess I guess one thing I'd point

1732
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,760
out that a lot of no actual Force so

1733
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,199
this is not a

1734
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:11,460
um so you're not changing the documents

1735
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,320
at all when you open a router because

1736
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,260
they have an actual force and of course

1737
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,760
you know we could retractively change

1738
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,960
the stream

1739
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,880
um but since um there aren't very many

1740
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,100
of them and

1741
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,440
um and it seems like the IV IB has free

1742
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,760
to approve or not approve a lot as they

1743
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,620
please in any fashion they place and the

1744
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,060
process they use can be pretty well to

1745
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,679
ask the RCB What It Takes and then take

1746
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,659
the rcb's answer and the reason to

1747
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:35,159
change right document would be at the

1748
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:37,320
RSA or IB wish to like reserve the

1749
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,060
restore like

1750
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,800
um itself from the right to like take

1751
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,880
that back but um as long as I I think we

1752
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,980
should like give up the right to take

1753
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,480
around those documents but I don't see

1754
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,159
the reason why you need to do that and

1755
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,400
so I think it's easiest which is just to

1756
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,420
firmative the IV approves them but

1757
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,500
informally asked rsat

1758
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,960
and again they have no Force so you know

1759
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,040
this is a tutorial

1760
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,420
proposing that that like the IRB

1761
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,100
approves like or like is in the loop for

1762
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,440
all of these documents and that I mean

1763
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,480
like for each document separately that

1764
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,460
doesn't make sense

1765
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,900
for the one

1766
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,480
I will always be formally approved right

1767
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,340
how many are there and how many how many

1768
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:27,380
uh maybe yeah maybe yeah

1769
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,960
but when it comes to the

1770
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,239
people people have submitted a lot of

1771
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:36,000
Verona on the format trap well I would

1772
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,380
suggest doing more of those because

1773
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,460
we're just going to actually do a

1774
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,500
version yeah I was going to say so for

1775
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,380
for the updates and obsoletions right

1776
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,080
um I think what we can actually do is we

1777
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,400
because you can't obsolete something

1778
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,920
from another stream but the IAB can

1779
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,420
basically at the point where the other

1780
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,040
rswg

1781
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,140
publishes a new a new document on their

1782
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,520
Twitter stream that's intended to

1783
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,960
obsolete something you can just Mark

1784
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,659
that thing as historic

1785
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:03,000
but the IB takes an action to mark their

1786
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,560
document as historic and there's a new

1787
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,719
document now and there's no obsolete

1788
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,580
relationship between the streams that

1789
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,320
way yeah but it's still clear that this

1790
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,239
document is known so but it's also not

1791
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,620
true that like a document from one

1792
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,060
stream cannot obsolete the document from

1793
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,159
another student no this happened like

1794
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:19,440
for dtn at least okay because we don't

1795
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,699
have any rules on that so that's what

1796
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:21,960
I'm trying to say I think we should have

1797
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,760
actually written a policy down and that

1798
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,739
should go like medical reviews this

1799
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:28,040
helps us here so let's uh use that

1800
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,600
okay so you don't want to raise it with

1801
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:34,020
the rswg as a policy issue

1802
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,659
yeah I mean we wrote a policy down for

1803
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:37,980
this for for up to two weeks between

1804
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,440
iitf stream and ITF stream so we can do

1805
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,620
something

1806
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,140
I don't remember that so my only my only

1807
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,000
question is do you want to raise a

1808
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
policy question with the rswg or do you

1809
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,580
not that's my question

1810
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,159
the policy question on Errata approval

1811
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:59,699
no open obsoleting and updating

1812
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:02,599
between streams

1813
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,219
that's why you can raise anything with

1814
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:06,960
the rswd somebody wants to do it they

1815
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,840
can do it from the rsat perspective

1816
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,239
well all we have to say is what we've

1817
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,640
decided that's it okay so we don't have

1818
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,239
to decide anything right

1819
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,600
number one and it relates to the Legacy

1820
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,860
stream

1821
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,800
which also sees around us and and where

1822
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,540
we also have the case where sometimes

1823
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,820
IDF documents want to update and the

1824
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,080
Legacy documents and we have at least

1825
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,280
some community members that are

1826
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,040
vehemently opposed of the iitf

1827
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,199
touching the Legacy stream in any way

1828
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,940
because it predates Us and how dare we

1829
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:41,400
right um so that that's a discussion

1830
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,380
that ourselves really could have in in

1831
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:44,880
that space

1832
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,020
um I don't think it's very urgent

1833
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,219
because we've been sitting on this

1834
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:48,780
problem for a long time but it's it's

1835
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:51,300
real very well my understanding is that

1836
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,040
the r sub doesn't want to officially

1837
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,659
raise this issue because there's no

1838
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:56,219
urgency but any individual in this room

1839
01:23:56,219 --> 01:23:58,440
can raise this issue on their own

1840
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,320
capacity okay perfect

1841
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,900
then we resolved this

1842
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,840
and Robert had another one go for it we

1843
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,020
have

1844
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:11,520
two more minutes

1845
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,860
when we went through the

1846
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:16,739
RC editor model V3 transitioned in the

1847
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:18,480
documents placed goals and

1848
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,100
responsibilities in different places

1849
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,280
there was a bangle there's at least one

1850
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,100
I've been pointing to it it hasn't

1851
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,020
become an important fix yet but at some

1852
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,460
point it will

1853
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:34,620
the IAB still is the body that is tasked

1854
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,140
with maintaining headers and motor plate

1855
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,760
I don't know if that's correct

1856
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,980
maintaining whatsoever the headers and

1857
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:44,400
boilerplate no it's not yes it is

1858
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,820
RFC 4280 updates that yeah and it's it's

1859
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,380
still on the IV webpage where we just

1860
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,900
tested earlier that it will be removed

1861
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:57,300
so let's let me go back and there's a

1862
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,800
place and learning community that

1863
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,480
intended to do this but I don't believe

1864
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,520
that it actually did it

1865
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,940
and it definitely didn't change the text

1866
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,820
that said that the IAB will maintain the

1867
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,980
website

1868
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,800
yes surely it didn't do that yes we can

1869
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,420
we can race narrative on it

1870
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,440
we should

1871
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,759
thanks Robert yes

1872
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,320
um

1873
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,380
any other other business

1874
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:31,699
I'm a racist as an error term paper

1875
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:33,900
okay

1876
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,540
can we talk about next meeting in one

1877
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,219
minute I really intend to do Yokohama

1878
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:39,960
and nothing before for US unless

1879
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,699
something comes from the rswg is that

1880
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:43,260
the plan

1881
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,120
um that's the plan and even if we don't

1882
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,920
have anything in Yokohama we might not

1883
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,179
have one

1884
01:25:48,179 --> 01:25:50,040
okay but the intention is to have it in

1885
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,560
your karma that would be that would at

1886
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,659
least be my impression

1887
01:25:54,659 --> 01:26:00,120
unless anything comes up okay

1888
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,239
perfect

1889
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,380
thank you

1890
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:05,450
thank you

1891
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:10,389
[Music]

1892
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:25,580
about that but

1893
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,820
too

1894
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,900
um

1895
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,829
[Music]

1896
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:01,940
you know that's that's not something

1897
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:08,340
institutions

1898
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:16,020
right
