had a chance to read this uh the note

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
well covers the IPR your participation

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,820
in meetings that's a bit of feedback

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
um Please be aware that uh anything you

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,560
state at the microphone plays onto the

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,960
mailing list or

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,659
um comment in general or is covered

33
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,000
under the IPR regulations of the ietf

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,640
and do you have agreed by that if you

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,420
are unaware of any of this please check

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,659
the relevant pcps which we normally call

37
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,399
out I think from the next page yes on

38
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,919
the next page on the next page so here

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,620
is a list of various pcps which should

40
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,120
uh introduce you to the internet

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,300
standards process uh and the processes

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,879
of working groups uh

43
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,180
talk about your about copyrights patents

44
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,940
and participation rules but also I will

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,040
draw attention to the Angie Harrison

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,379
procedures harassment procedures and

47
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,780
code of conduct although we promote

48
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,879
vigorous debate

49
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,580
um bullying and unacceptable behavior is

50
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,560
obviously unacceptable and there is a

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,900
process to address this so if you feel

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,239
the behavior becomes I understand out of

53
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,160
hand please let the chairs know it's our

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,840
responsibility to prevent that from

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,819
happening and there is a proper well

56
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,620
thought out formal process to handle it

57
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,260
just to draw your attention to it

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,010
foreign

59
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,179
[Music]

60
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,220
because this is a joint remote and

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,260
in-person meeting and I must say it is

62
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,540
very nice to see so many people in

63
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,920
person this is feeling like an

64
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,260
old-fashioned ietf again which I'm so

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,000
sorry Eve there's a really nice Buzz

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,319
here and you're missing it someday

67
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,260
because we're going to use a shared

68
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,080
queue for the mics please make sure you

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,940
use the little app on your phone or or

70
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,760
click the uh join the queue button on

71
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,099
your laptop so that remote participants

72
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,019
can also join the queue fairly so we

73
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,940
don't have two cues

74
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,640
um as ever if you're speaking please

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
state your name first it's just useful

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,560
for the note takers

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,780
um mask wearing yeah mask in the room

78
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,299
please it's policy unless you are

79
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,340
actively speaking at the microphone

80
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,319
myself as actively speaking at the

81
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,900
moment also to avoid feedback can you

82
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,959
mute your uh laptop audio particularly

83
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,239
if you're remote to save on feedback

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,040
headphones strongly recommended if you

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,319
are at home

86
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,159
um

87
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,179
yeah that's it so

88
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,500
we will be using the integrated

89
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,060
meteco interactive markdown for minutes

90
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,019
um

91
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,839
this is a collaborative tool I don't

92
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,180
believe we have an official minute taker

93
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,540
so please either if you want to take

94
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,240
copious minutes please attack right now

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,820
but more importantly if you want to make

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,560
a point and you don't believe it's being

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,960
caught or your name is not being

98
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,180
captured spelled correctly please get

99
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,919
into that online minutes and and make

100
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,299
sure that's properly recorded

101
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,280
the probably collaboration is everyone

102
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,600
assumes everyone else is going to

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,699
collaborate rather than you and then we

104
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,199
don't capture the minutes correctly so

105
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,880
it's a sort of group responsibility to

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,259
make sure we've got some proper minutes

107
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,139
taken uh the meeting materials uh I'm

108
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,520
assuming by the fact you can see these

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,500
slides you can get to this URL so it's a

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,080
bit of a recursive problem but

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
um all the meeting materials are

112
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
available through the data tracker and

113
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,580
through the low speed Echo integration

114
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,340
and as ever we are an ietf working group

115
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,840
which means we have a mailing list which

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,120
is raw.etf.org I hope you are all

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,600
subscribed uh that is the best place to

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
have long and lengthy discussions

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,979
um and if you need to contact the chairs

120
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,740
for uh admin purposes there is a raw

121
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,100
hyphen shares mailing list to be used

122
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,300
for

123
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,380
um

124
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,139
administrative purposes not for topics

125
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:43,160
of uh content discussion and there's the

126
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
um

127
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,780
let me take us come back again right

128
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,520
we've had some

129
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,639
had some networking issues this week

130
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,620
is it recovering

131
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,360
yes

132
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
oops maybe not

133
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,280
shall I give it a shot from over here

134
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,000
find the slides again

135
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,940
sorry

136
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,520
small technical details we do not

137
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
apparently have reliable and available

138
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,820
Wireless in the room so

139
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,020
so Eve do you want to go through the

140
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,180
document status otherwise it's just been

141
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,960
talking

142
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,340

143
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,060

tracking uh on the mailing list uh the

145
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,660
um the status of things we are very

146
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,259
close due to the hard work of the

147
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,539
authors and our A.D John Scudder the

148
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,380

ads and reviewers

157

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,780
so and the use cases draft

172
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,960
uh has similarly begun uh to progress

173
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,060
through the iesg and has received

174
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,280
um let's see a routing review uh and uh

175
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,340
it's been through the tsv so the

176
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,599
transport and gen art uh reviews as well

177
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,379
and thanks to I believe

178
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,220
um

179
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,300
is it Karina who is the uh Shepherd for

180
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,680
this

181
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,919
um we are now at uh a REV of the

182
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,259
document I think it's eight

183
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,360
um having Incorporated all of the

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,880
feedback from the three reviews so far

185
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,219
uh we still have quite a few that we

186
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,958
await

187
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,799
um then the Technologies draft has begun

188
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,980
that journey and so

189
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,180
um uh Carlos bernardos has

190
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,720
um you know solicited the feedback from

191
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,459
the uh authors on IPR so at least at

192
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,640
this moment in time we haven't uh gotten

193
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,940
any uh there's nothing eventful

194
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,160
happening in on the IPR front I mean no

195
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,660
one has any

196
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,880
um anything to declare there but in the

197
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,560
meantime we've had a funny exploration

198
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,200
of the draft but I think uh once things

199
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,880
open up again

200
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,240
um it will be resubmitted there was also

201
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,880
some interesting activity on the 3gpp

202
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,940
front in the SAT at SA

203
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,860
can I interrupt you just calluses at the

204
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,399
mic just hello sorry I was just looking

205
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,339
at the document I was like

206
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,180
ahead Carlos

207
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,279
um just to to basically apologize for

208
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,019
not taking or not progressing on the on

209
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,120
the separating for that document I I

210
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,399
started I expect to have the

211
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,440
the right up in the next one or two

212
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,040
weeks while the IPR uh declarations are

213
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,220
are made so I just wanted to update a

214
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,260
bit on that and apologize for taking a

215
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,300
bit longer than it should have been

216
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,720
clicking so thanks no worries we are

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,600
greatly appreciative of you uh taking on

218
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,019
the shepherding and um in the queue as

219
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,660
well Eve sorry go for it I'm looking in

220
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,519
the wrong places I got I don't have

221
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,980
enough Windows here hi Pascal not pop up

222
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,839
in the corner of your screen no it is I

223
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,120
was on the wrong View at where I am so I

224
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,920
wasn't seeing the

225
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
go ahead let's go just for Carlos since

226
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,420
you have to indicate the number

227
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,060
um I owe janash to publish a slight

228
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,959
update

229
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,540
of the technology draft because of the

230
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,980
new references that the inertia has

231
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,720
provided and probably that's what Eve is

232
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,420
alluding to as well so I will publish it

233
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,720
like next week arrive so you know

234
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,240
perfect and for those of you

235
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,760
um who may not know that there was a

236
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,380
detnet study group in the 3gppsa2 group

237
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,540
and um and so they have a new

238
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,579
publication and so there's some slight

239
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,339
wording updates regarding

240
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,620
um the recommendations there uh that

241
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,000
once things open up

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,060
um Pascal will resubmit on

243
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,140
and um and then life goes on with

244
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,300
regards to the other documents uh we'll

245
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,180
hear a lot today about the architecture

246
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,740
document

247
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,240
um the framework document is a little

248
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,000
bit uh off into the future oam is

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,920
progressing

250
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,019
um we do need to understand what's

251
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,160
happening with our industrial

252
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,500
requirements document our last

253
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,120
correspondence was that there was going

254
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,540
to be a new rev uh but we're uh we need

255
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,640
to close on that

256
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,700
um and then of course there are three

257
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,260
um documents I think they're all

258
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,620
Carlos's uh uh at least he's a co-author

259
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,519
on them

260
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,440
um that are under consideration for a

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,959
working group adoption have I missed

262
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,519
anything

263
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,820
if if I'm corrective call us as

264
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,500
published personal drafts because

265
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,880
they're interesting but I'm not sure you

266
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,500
asked for working group adoption I think

267
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,779
you said no we have not do a bit more

268
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,940
work on this so it's it's not really for

269
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,320
consideration of the working group as

270
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,540
work but certainly of interest to the

271
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,399
working group is that right Carlos is at

272
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
the mic uh yes basically

273
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,260
um I I was waiting a bit for the working

274
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,420
group to be done with the other uh

275
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,360
actual Milestones to then ask to the

276
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,279
working group if this may be considered

277
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,839
as something interesting so I will be

278
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,240
waiting until the other things are out

279
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,260
of the line

280
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,700
I think that makes a lot of sense

281
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,000
okay all right I'm controlling the

282
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,160
slides

283
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,779
the thing that the sleepy person in the

284
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,300
room or the virtual room needs to

285
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,000
remember is to advance those lives

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,880
um and so our agenda today is uh really

287
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,920
to focus and give time to the

288
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,660
architecture draft

289
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,720
um and Pascal has done a tremendous

290
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,000
amount of work on it with his co-authors

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
and there's been lots of discussion both

292
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
on and off the list and he will be

293
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,440
giving us a very detailed update on that

294
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,300
at this point so

295
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,200
um

296
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,480
I'm conscious that we have a good size

297
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
session today and and the architecture

298
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,339
draft is

299
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,720
um it's getting a lot of review it's

300
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,279
getting a lot of comment and it's it's

301
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,519
slightly blocking our work so really

302
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,000
what I would like to see is uh us really

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,680
tackle the architecture draft almost

304
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,660
Workshop it we have the time we have

305
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,839
relevant people in the room and and as a

306
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,970
precursor to this uh Pascal uh

307
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,680
[Music]

308
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,360
myself had had a pre-meeting to talk

309
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,220
about how can we how can we make

310
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,019
progress what are the main sticking

311
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,200
points here are they insurmountable can

312
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,839
we make progress or have we have we got

313
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,220
a problem here

314
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,019
and the answer was actually we didn't

315
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,300
have a problem we could make progress

316
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,820
but the recommendation from in fact the

317
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,100
decision by the chairs and and thank you

318
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,139
Pascal for for letting us make that

319
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,360
decision was

320
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,420
given the architecture document

321
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,779
actually has two introduces two new

322
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,740
Concepts one very much about how does

323
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,880
raw make deterministic forwarding plane

324
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,899
decisions and a separate

325
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,380
novel piece of work which is a new kind

326
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,620
of service function or a forwarding

327
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,160
plane uh protection function which is

328
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,760
the the pareo function

329
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,360
by introducing both of these new pieces

330
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,639
of work within one document firstly the

331
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,260
document got big

332
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,000
and the bigger the document the harder

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,620
it is to review and the harder it is to

334
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,600
maintain readability Etc as we all are

335
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,480
well aware and secondly

336
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,360
we felt as chairs that the

337
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,019
um

338
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,440
the introduction of the new uh

339
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,980
forwarding plane control ability and

340
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,579
that fast feedback loop around PSE was

341
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,899
the architectural piece and the perio

342
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,740
piece could be introduced in parallel at

343
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,720
a slightly slower rate

344
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,360
so we can have an architecture document

345
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,519
without having to get the details of

346
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,300
perio correct in one big bang

347
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,980
we should just split the document in

348
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,139
half and that means we would have a

349
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,120
lighter architecture document that would

350
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,420
talk about PSE and make sure it was a

351
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,480
good quality document that framed a

352
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,240
bigger pardon that framed what raw was

353
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,279
hoping to achieve and then we could take

354
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,980
time to get perio nicely described have

355
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,839
good quality discussion and review and

356
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,740
so on

357
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,980
the complication when splitting a very

358
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,500
large document is there is now quite a

359
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,019
large group of contributors

360
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,940
and

361
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,980
it is always difficult trying to

362
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,899
attribute the right text to the right

363
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,459
people particularly when there have been

364
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,579
many revisions and many contributions

365
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,860
some which may have not survived the

366
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,519
different revisions and so as chairs we

367
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,300
took the often unpopular decision to say

368
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
both of these documents will now have

369
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,160
one editor all contributors will be

370
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,560
placed in the acknowledgments section

371
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,860
and acknowledged as key contributors to

372
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,839
the document but there will now be an

373
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,360
editor rather than a set of authors of

374
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,639
both of these documents

375
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,360
um I will say the chairs and the ad are

376
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,940
very happy to discuss that decision to

377
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,560
make sure people understand that the

378
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,839
authors understand that clearly but

379
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,360
we'll take that Offline that that isn't

380
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,740
really a matter for the working group

381
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,800
it's a it's a matter for the chairs

382
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,380
given we are moving to the there is an

383
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,600
editor and a group of and and the

384
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,220
working group contributes to it model

385
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,980
you have to name that editor as Pascal

386
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,319
has been carrying the editorial pen at

387
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,939
least over the last couple of revisions

388
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,720
and he's happy to do so uh we wish to

389
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,119
make Pascal the editor of these

390
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,599
documents again if you feel that is

391
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,099
contentious and you have any complaints

392
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,079
about it please talk to the chairs and

393
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,179
the ad and we will get this resolved in

394
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,099
some way as far as the working group is

395
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,040
concerned I believe this decision will

396
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,080
help us make progress on Raw

397
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,900
architecture and let us do proper review

398
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,020
and consideration on perio and unblock

399
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,799
some of the workers Carlos alluded to

400
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,200
which is sat in the backlog waiting for

401
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,500
adoption or for those of us to find

402
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,320
review time to look at when we have a

403
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,820
nice architecture document we're really

404
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,740
happy with that can frame our our

405
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,660
decisions and our reviews

406
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,120
would anyone Carlos is at the mic go for

407
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,679
it

408
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,480
thanks Carlos

409
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,679
um I I don't have any issue with the

410
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,660
decision uh I'm perfectly fine I think

411
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,340
this is the right one to

412
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,160
keep Pascal as a leader of documents I I

413
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,679
had just a qualification question so is

414
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,080
this a split meant to be like one

415
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,480
document is will will be like taking

416
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,660
care of how the uh raw architecture

417
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,880
entangles with the dead net and ensure

418
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
that everything is coordinated while the

419
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,480
other one will basically take care of

420
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,780
the very much Wireless specifics and in

421
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,660
this way kind of

422
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,520
uh facilitate the integration I mean

423
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,460
because you mentioned

424
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,539
optimize functions will be in the new

425
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:37,980
work document

426
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,480
to me that's fine and then the

427
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,700
interaction with the OEM generalized.net

428
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,679
will be in the other one to me that

429
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,480
would make sense but I don't know if I

430
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,299
understood properly the idea behind

431
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,860
yes I believe you have understood

432
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,120
correctly

433
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,280
um you you said one thing there which I

434
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,500
would qualify which is

435
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,380
um the architecture document is the you

436
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,000
said less one is focused I would

437
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,100
disagree there because I would say in

438
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,260
that architecture document we still talk

439
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,660
about the fast feedback loop with the

440
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,940
OEM plane because Wireless moves much

441
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,700
faster than than in general wired

442
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,320
networks and so we have that faster

443
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,020
feedback loop and that PSE concept which

444
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,059
I would suggest is

445
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,340
very much uh

446
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,740
uh Wireless focused you know these are

447
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,200
Wireless adaptations but then the the

448
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,500
details of the the protection function

449
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,100
uh perio specifically Wireless optimized

450
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,840
protection function makes more sense

451
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,539
yeah I agree I express myself not very

452
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,419
clearly of course the the pses the quick

453
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,160
architecture component enabling this and

454
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,539
this is in the first document I mean

455
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,220
that then the specific function that

456
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,020
this component may do to do these things

457
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,400
is in the other one yeah okay thank you

458
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,260
I'm going to pause here if anyone else

459
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,440
has any comment on on this decision this

460
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,539
is a good moment to air concerns if you

461
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,500
have any

462
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,960
otherwise

463
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,460
Carlos is still in the queue no he's

464
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,480
gone

465
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,799
um

466
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,020
otherwise we'll move on what's the next

467
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,100
slide I think we're going to get

468
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,720
straight into the into the guts a bit

469
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,419
aren't we yeah so

470
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,480
Pascal you have plenty of time

471
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,260
let's

472
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,299
okay so uh probably I'm entitled to take

473
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,100
this off I'm the lucky guy in this room

474
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,480
I that's probably not going to work for

475
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,340
my laptop so

476
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
um

477
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,140
try it it's not paired with my machine

478
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,640
and I'm showing the slides so I don't

479
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,780
think oh yeah

480
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,919
okay

481
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,039
well next slide please

482
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,600
okay so

483
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,880
um I will start with the draft with the

484
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,020
slides I prepared before the meeting

485
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,000
knowing that with the recent discussion

486
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,520
some of that is partly resolved or

487
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,620
appears to be on good way of resolution

488
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,059
to be agreed with the group and uh so

489
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,360
we'll see where we are for which those

490
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,760
slides might be slightly obsolete

491
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,700
so what happened recently is a lot of

492
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,520
great reviews I mean a lot of exchanges

493
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,840
with lu yeah thank you all for for the

494
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,240
time you you spent on on

495
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,299
reading the document and and considering

496
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,700
it and Etc

497
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,900
uh part of the results is uh Lou is uh

498
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,659
added as a contributor to document and

499
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,880
but now she strongly acknowledged I

500
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,860
don't remember if it is on the published

501
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,419
version but you are certainly in the

502
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,059
acknowledgment Village

503
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,178
um

504
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,419
and then there were lucaments about

505
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,760
pario that we are still need that still

506
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,559
need to be discussed and with you know

507
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,200
the decision that the chairs made uh

508
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,000
those commands now will apply to a

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,679
separate document and so they will be

510
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,059
made separately and they are not

511
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,340
blocking the architecture document

512
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,320
anymore

513
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,919
we did a lot of restructuring to help

514
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,720
the new readers because we're all used

515
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,520
to what we are saying but the new reader

516
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,159
may want something more serial so we we

517
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,500
reorganized a bit the introduction got

518
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,179
simpler

519
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,640
um and based on the comment by Liu of

520
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,980
what is raw exactly we we extracted a

521
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,440
new sections free

522
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,260
also the term UDA appeared many times

523
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,539
that it was a fundamentally new thing so

524
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,120
that has been there for like 50 plus

525
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
years

526
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,500
um and the fact that it respects the UDA

527
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,539
model is not the fundamental fundamental

528
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,159
thing the fundamental thing is we have

529
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,799
this fast control Loop

530
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,539
UDA is a model for control Loop is the

531
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,799
model the model that we are following

532
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,460
but it's a control Loop so we we renamed

533
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,799
the section row control Loop to insist

534
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,240
it is a control loop as opposed to

535
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,559
insisting that it's following the

536
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,640
odometer

537
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,900
right

538
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,299
uh there was also these points I mean

539
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,820
it's my French here uh where I said

540
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,880
something like Row versus Net in one

541
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,799
section title and for me it meant

542
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,760
nothing

543
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,799
but probably in English

544
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,659
there is a sense to that

545
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,840
and we I really made you know how do you

546
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,820
compare this and that that was the

547
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,700
meaning but these verses that appears to

548
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,440
be a conflict

549
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,760
certainly rowan.net don't conflict the

550
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,919
goal is that you know it's we are

551
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,679
providing a plug-in functionality into

552
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,559
that net and so there is it cannot

553
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,740
conflict it has to smoothly integrate so

554
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,960
certainly the title gave the wrong

555
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,460
impression sorry for my French

556
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,340
um so yes we clarified that you know row

557
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,220
is a specialized announcement that

558
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,440
mostly applies to wireless but since we

559
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,100
are layer 3 it could apply anywhere

560
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,640
but the needs really appeared in the

561
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,820
context of ILS through RS mesh

562
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,039
next slide please

563
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,760
a number of issues that we discussed

564
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,220
there was one and probably it's against

565
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,440
again my French all the way expressed

566
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,960
things but seemed that the text could be

567
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,880
read as if we were changing something on

568
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,200
wireless we are not touching Wireless

569
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,480
that would be a layer violation the best

570
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,679
we can do is Prov provide hints to the

571
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
lower layer about the sort of thing we

572
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,580
would like to see achieved

573
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,580
and we currently don't have even the

574
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,940
apis for doing this but the architecture

575
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,580
should show that we expect that someday

576
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,640
we might have something and we need to

577
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,440
position it and that something is

578
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,340
basically some capability to

579
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,960
hint the lower layers of the sort of

580
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,780
result that we would like to see an

581
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,640
example of results is if you send

582
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,260
something on Wi-Fi today you'll get by

583
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,000
default 64 retries which could take

584
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,080
forever

585
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,299
in in row that doesn't make any sense

586
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,500
because we have we have a bounded

587
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,460
latency

588
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,440
so at some point we need to tell hey Mr

589
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
Wi-Fi I know you're doing your best but

590
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,220
if you don't send that within that

591
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,980
bonded latency drop it

592
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,940
or a if you can please do at least a few

593
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,080
retries right you don't know you're

594
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,600
doing that that's Layer Two but try to

595
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,820
make the reliability of this packet a

596
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,380
factor five I don't know how to express

597
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,659
that but make it more reliable than this

598
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,100
other packet

599
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,200
by doing more retries doing retries

600
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,299
faster I don't know the way you do it

601
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,700
okay so conceptually the architecture

602
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,080
should represent

603
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,059
that service access point basically

604
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,220
between layers three and lower layer

605
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,900
where we can express more than just here

606
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,779
is a packet do your stuff

607
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,820
okay

608
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,700
it may be that this interface could be

609
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,440
useful for wires as well because at some

610
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,020
point if we don't have a time-based

611
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,059
shaper and we have something like a an

612
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,620
essential shaper it may be that we want

613
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,000
to provide a lower layer with the

614
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,020
bounded latency as well

615
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,260
um so yes we we clarify that we we are

616
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,059
the architectural layer so what we are

617
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,380
doing is conceptual but we are basically

618
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,260
adding new services

619
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,799
and they are considered and meant to

620
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,080
apply at least to the technologies that

621
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,440
we we support we have in our Charter and

622
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,640
are listed in the Raw technology

623
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,879
um

624
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,659
there is this this problem of one Hub

625
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,340
which could be solved at Layer Two and

626
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,440
multi-hub which is what we do at layer

627
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,919
3. and certainly we

628
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,140
we already have a lot of work and

629
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,179
capabilities for

630
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,279
getting information from the lower layer

631
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,260
and then we use that in writing we

632
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,980
compute we have our SSI we lqi we we can

633
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,720
do it TX there are tons of things we can

634
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,940
do we've got delete and we want to build

635
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,440
on all this

636
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,600
and at the same time we need to to do it

637
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,220
over Malta help

638
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,620
so um

639
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,480
we need to differentiate this concept

640
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,980
and see how they work together that's

641
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,659
part of of what the architecture must

642
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,080
represent

643
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,799
and then there was this this question

644
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,740
from it was coming from the blue but one

645
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,380
of the parallel functions is is over a

646
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,559
yearing meaning that one sounds

647
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,659
and you know by the magic of of the

648
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:37,799
radio transmission there will be

649
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,360
multiple receivers

650
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,900
and again it's probably my French I must

651
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,340
have written it such a way that it looks

652
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,080
oh it's completely new to write jokes

653
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,840
radios and obviously yellow wires were

654
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,279
like that so it's not like it's

655
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,980
completely new to radios uh if you

656
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,840
configure a switch with promiscuous mode

657
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,240
on one port that bot will get all the

658
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,159
packets mostly we do it for tracing not

659
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,919
for forwarding but but that exists you

660
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,299
could even illumination that you could

661
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,500
even have an underlay which is a

662
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,880
multicast to send your unique aspect

663
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,799
I've never seen that I don't know why we

664
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,679
should do it but it's feasible

665
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,340
um so yes over a yearing could happen at

666
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,640
a cost just happened that for wireless

667
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,340
yes one transmission from A to B is less

668
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,640
C compared to wires but there are ways

669
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,220
which are other properties of the same

670
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,279
medium by which this disadvantage can be

671
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,980
compensated and and it comes from the

672
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,380
same magic that causes the loss is that

673
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,779
others can listen to it can we do

674
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,000
something to compensate the fact that

675
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,059
one point to point radio obstruction is

676
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,400
low C with the fact that in fact

677
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,320
physically speaking it is a pawn to

678
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
multi-point thing

679
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,320
and that's really what we want to

680
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,760
discuss with these promiscuous over

681
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,360
hearing thing don't say hey yes you you

682
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,059
receive ratio drops if you consider the

683
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,620
link as point to point like we would on

684
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,480
wires typically

685
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,820
but on this on the other hand there is a

686
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,039
zero four ratio on the other guy here

687
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,500
that we could exploit because he got it

688
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,419
if we consider that in the overall

689
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,179
routing a maybe the the loss here is

690
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,179
compensated by the received is there and

691
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,059
rho is a lot about doing that and one of

692
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,799
the methods effectively that we can

693
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,140
Leverage is this of our urine sec

694
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,980
so we we insist that

695
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,140
it's not it's something that yes it was

696
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,580
always there it's not the question the

697
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,799
question is here we intend to really use

698
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,140
it and build on it and consider that it

699
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,120
exists and include it now rotting

700
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,120
thinking so that if the the packet is

701
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,399
received by the wrong guy and the wrong

702
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,559
guy is on the right path yeah the packet

703
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,240
can continue

704
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,179
see that that's that's part of raw

705
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,020
next slide please

706
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,840
okay so when I said that some of these

707
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,820
slides and that's basically a third of

708
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,159
them is probably obsolete by now this is

709
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,760
this is it

710
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,559
so um

711
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,799
we need to discuss Barrio we need to go

712
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,779
into the details of how it works what it

713
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,640
does whether it's new or not is not so

714
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,799
relevant more relevant is how we're

715
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,120
going to use it

716
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,279
how we're going to abstract it how we're

717
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,200
going to talk to the lower layers to get

718
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,140
them to do things for us because we

719
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,640
don't do it for the most Peace by

720
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,440
ourselves at day or three

721
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,679
but it's another document so this

722
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,380
document is supposed to give the big

723
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,480
picture so we have we have this tension

724
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,039
it's not on the slide but I realize we

725
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,740
had this tension with Lou about a new I

726
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,880
mean you know you're free to come to the

727
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
mic anytime if I'm not misspeaking but

728
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,059
we have this tension where I had an

729
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,399
intention that this architecture is the

730
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,100
big picture I did not focus so much on

731
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,919
what's new what's not new I focused on

732
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,500
here is how it works right here is there

733
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,000
is the map of London

734
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,980
and if the the London Bridge has been

735
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,659
there for 200 years it's still on the

736
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:01,980
map it's still a fundamental component

737
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,299
of this architecture

738
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,179
whereas another reader could say hey all

739
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,860
these things I know them well I just

740
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,720
want this document to focus on exactly

741
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,820
what's new well if I just give you

742
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,559
what's new you don't have the map of the

743
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,440
city you just have the shot right so

744
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,419
there is this tension about you know

745
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,220
wasting time of the reader by saying

746
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,600
something he already knows and yes in

747
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,419
everywhere and the fact that you still

748
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,700
need to provide the map of the city

749
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,039
so that's something we have to arbitrate

750
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,580
but um personally I'm happy with the

751
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,860
current content of the document I would

752
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,559
not like to strip it too much so I focus

753
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,080
really only on the very new things I

754
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,960
want to to show how the components are

755
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,940
integrated together the new and the old

756
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,000
and then there was this track segment uh

757
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,820
T path and I still need to lose help on

758
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,399
exactly crafting the words but we we

759
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,220
inherit from Two Worlds like this Java

760
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,140
class which originate from two to

761
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,899
interfaces and and there might be

762
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,880
collisions and effectively we've got

763
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,740
collisions

764
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,820
um

765
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,299
in the small tiny iot groups

766
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,840
we have agreed that the term path was so

767
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,600
overused overloaded that it lost a lot

768
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,179
of its significance and we kind of when

769
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,580
we talk about path we end up not really

770
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,020
figuring out what the guy is talking

771
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,860
about

772
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,860
so for the thing that we built

773
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,580
for radio multipath Etc we crafted this

774
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,039
term of truck

775
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,740
and so I as I'm coming from that world

776
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,720
I've been using it and using it and

777
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,240
using it it's using the 60s architecture

778
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,279
it is in the role documents it is

779
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,960
everywhere

780
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,240
and if you look at it it does not

781
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,480
represent a path as most of us are used

782
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,480
to call a path a path in the past

783
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,500
research working groups and stuff is an

784
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,559
observable thing it is the result of a

785
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,080
packet going through a network the path

786
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,600
is where this packet has been to go from

787
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,019
A to B it is a consequence it is an

788
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,059
observable I I have listed in the

789
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,059
document the quote because if I don't

790
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,620
speak it correctly at least the code is

791
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,659
in the architecture

792
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,440
um

793
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,240
now if you go to other documents you

794
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,100
will see other definitions of path and

795
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,019
they're they got more and more wide and

796
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,519
more and more elastic

797
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,279
and then Lou understands the definitions

798
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,299
that are done in teas Etc so but but my

799
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,500
concern was

800
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,659
path is supposed to be an actual thing

801
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,519
it's supposed to be where the packet is

802
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,840
going to be and it's observable it's

803
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,519
measurable you know what it's going to

804
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,980
be just like my example for that is the

805
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,080
moon around the earth which has an orbit

806
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,940
you know where the Moon is you know it's

807
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,179
going to be and if there is something

808
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,799
which should cause the moon to change

809
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,100
its strike like we send this big uh bomb

810
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,019
on the moon to make it change like in

811
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,080
Cosmos 99 for those who have seen that

812
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,059
it's still predictable we know will

813
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,740
control we'll know we're going to do

814
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,599
that we'll throw the truck out at the

815
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,219
Moon it will change its orbit and we'll

816
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,139
know the new orbit

817
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,619
now track is not like that the truck is

818
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:19,199
the aggregate of all the possible place

819
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,820
the packet can be

820
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,560
but at any point of time you don't know

821
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,940
where it is the packet can be Network

822
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,040
coded meaning that it's turned into

823
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,780
smaller chunks which are sent on

824
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,399
different paths there is not one place

825
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,440
where the packet is

826
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,500
okay and because of the PSC activity at

827
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,179
for for this packet and maybe a few

828
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,918
packets

829
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,480
it's going to be a subset of all those

830
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,339
hubs which are going to be used for this

831
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,780
packet it's not the whole track the

832
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,359
whole story of what we are doing here is

833
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,460
to not use the full track

834
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,040
but always use a subset of it that is

835
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,820
enough to get 2.5 copies of your packet

836
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,720
to the end

837
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,980
but it's never the same until you stop

838
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,080
the system and observe one package you

839
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,060
never know what the packets will be

840
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,099
so that's why I like this Quantum thing

841
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,859
uh this Quantum analogy because

842
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,740
the track is to an orbit what an orbital

843
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,380
is you know for electrons the electronic

844
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,660
orbital is a statistical representation

845
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,000
of where quote-unquote the electron can

846
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,520
be but unless you stop the system to

847
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,440
observe it you will never know where the

848
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,520
electron is

849
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,140
and in fact we take some work even if

850
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,760
you stop the system if you don't know

851
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,900
but

852
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,540
um the analogy is there the analogy is

853
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,820
the track represents a statistical

854
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,760
aggregate of possibilities where our

855
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,820
path is the observable result of

856
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,460
a packet I've I've been that has been

857
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,020
flowing through the network

858
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,960
and if we use the same term I was

859
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,880
concerned that's why I had all that

860
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,060
discussion that it be the term path now

861
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,220
is is even more abstract and people less

862
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,660
and less understand what they're talking

863
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,899
about

864
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,500
so I was all for a special term now Lou

865
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,359
told me yesterday that maybe there is

866
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,820
the term that net pass or something that

867
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,000
is in the detnet documents

868
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,980
that we could use the bottom line is we

869
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,839
kind of agreed that the terminology must

870
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,820
provide all the terms

871
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,700
and provide the synonyms and kind of

872
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,740
explain that this actually comes from

873
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,240
different place but means the same thing

874
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,800
as that

875
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,240
kind of

876
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,400
so I'll try to craft that and I hope Lou

877
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,460
will help me do that terminology then

878
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,440
we'll have to the thing which will be

879
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,240
around on me but I have probably have to

880
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,420
do it is going through the text and see

881
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,160
every time I use the term track and

882
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,960
change it to this new thing which comes

883
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,079
from the cheese world

884
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,599
uh it's less familiar for me uh all of a

885
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,460
sudden I feel that I don't Master what

886
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,640
I'm talking about anymore but um so can

887
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,560
I jump in at this point uh I am in the

888
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,940
queue as well as kind of with my chair

889
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,800
hat on

890
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,960
as I see it

891
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,900
Rory has a very close relationship with

892
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,599
detnet we are very much a sibling group

893
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,640
of of debt net so I think there is

894
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,800
relevance in making sure the terminology

895
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,180
we use in our documents Maps very

896
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,400
closely to the terminology used in

897
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,240
detnet so someone in in the world of

898
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,800
deterministic networking can understand

899
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,380
what that net does and what raw does

900
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,380
using the same terminology I absolutely

901
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,839
understand the point of within the

902
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,099
Wireless World completely different

903
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,079
terms are used for

904
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,800
things which may or may be close to

905
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,060
terms used in the debtnet world so I

906
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,920
absolutely agree with the suggestion

907
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,040
that some kind of glossary to make sure

908
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,960
that there is a mapping between the

909
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,780
different terminology universes out

910
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,060
there but I would

911
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,140
suggest strongly that the main terms are

912
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,660
you that are used are the debt net terms

913
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,359
so that cues up Lou Who is behind me in

914
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,220
the queue and I would like you to step

915
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,780
to the queue

916
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,119
this track concept because I'm very

917
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,380
happy for this session to be quite

918
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,180
workshoppy here

919
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,000
what is the corresponding debt net term

920
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,780
that we should be using instead of track

921
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,660
or do we need to Define

922
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,520
and I actually don't care what the word

923
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,079
is do we need to con to Define this

924
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,460
potential total

925
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,640
Transit across this orbital

926
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,440
go

927
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,619
so what is a track I'm not I'm being

928
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,780
serious what's a track give us a tight

929
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,660
definition of a track the track is

930
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,579
defined in the architecture if we could

931
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,020
read it to make sure we have other words

932
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,020
it's crafted I spend time on it but it's

933
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,220
basically the the collection of hops on

934
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,440
which the packet may pass depending on

935
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,839
what the PLC decides to try and the

936
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,900
radio accepts to forward

937
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,560
so in ietf traffic engineering we call

938
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,480
that a path

939
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,220
the the

940
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,660
buff

941
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,480
in ietf traffic engineering I'm not

942
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,420
talking about you know

943
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,740
pattern research group I'm not talking

944
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,780
about other research groups I'm talking

945
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,880
about in the context of traffic

946
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,820
engineering that's called a path I I

947
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,619
understand that and you gave me links

948
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,180
and I read those links

949
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,940
and I was not convinced that we are

950
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,260
talking about the same thing because

951
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,320
when I looked at the text on path it

952
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,740
still indicated something which was kind

953
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,099
of deterministic where the Tre the track

954
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,540
is statistical

955
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,300
in terms of operation I mean once you

956
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,180
you configure your track your path to

957
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,560
work like this even if it does

958
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,599
replication not replication you cannot

959
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,300
say do this from it's not from a local

960
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,160
Loop or anything that that is kind of

961
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,599
hidden inside the system but it's

962
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,160
something which is recontrolled by the

963
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,099
outside then for a long time quote

964
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,079
unquote in those orders of magnitudes

965
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,220
it's just a matter of orders of

966
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,619
magnitude and time but for for a long

967
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,359
period of time which is observable by

968
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,300
the PC Etc the the network Behavior will

969
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,560
be exactly that

970
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,260
and then you can decide for whatever

971
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,440
reasons most reliability to change that

972
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,420
and then there will be an action that's

973
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,940
visible that's from the outside and so

974
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,760
the path is always very well known at

975
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,020
each point of time it's completely

976
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,960
controlled do I misunderstand

977
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,640
so in the context of ITF traffic

978
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,900
engineering

979
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,220
a service may be supported by many paths

980
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,740
they're often called primary secondary

981
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,619
or protection or alternate

982
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,200
and a the

983
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,740
um the actual path that is used and that

984
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,980
may be one or more is based on a the

985
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,180
protection switching function that's

986
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,060
being used yeah so we've had one plus

987
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,940
one protection of which uh pre-off and

988
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,500
net is a new type of packet one plus one

989
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,200
um we've had one for end protection

990
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,560
and in for various Technologies to me

991
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,200
Paro sounds like a new one for n

992
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,740
protection scheme that is being used

993
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,440
um being defined for wireless and maybe

994
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,599
it's not one friend maybe it's one plus

995
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,000
or fourn because sometimes you might use

996
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,440
multiple sometimes you might use one

997
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,440
that's what I mean by orbital

998
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,240
I prefer to stick to terms that we've

999
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,180
used in the ietf and really you know

1000
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,220
we're operating within the context of

1001
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,099
ITF traffic engineering from teas that's

1002
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,079
further downscoped to detnet which is

1003
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,300
further downscope to Raw so it would be

1004
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,180
good if as we sort of proper you know

1005
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,520
populate up in terminology that we

1006
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,520
inherit uh terminology from the groups

1007
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,760
that we are inheriting technology I I

1008
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,400
understand that desire but at the same

1009
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
time understand it I'm all for it

1010
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,300
conceptually incompetual for it I'm

1011
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,579
discussing because

1012
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,680
each time groups like traffic

1013
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,660
engineering have taken the same time as

1014
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,119
before and extending its meaning the the

1015
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,859
sense of that world has become to

1016
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,560
started to become more and more fluid or

1017
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,900
something and so two people unless they

1018
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,820
really speak within the same context

1019
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,980
start not talking about the same thing

1020
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,720
and they don't even realize it that's

1021
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,500
the danger of overloading terms and

1022
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,980
here I have the cells that we make a

1023
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,260
small step

1024
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,240
overloading path yet a little more

1025
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,000
because in my view I mean I I want to

1026
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,880
use these I I want to do it anywhere

1027
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,680
there is one desire I have to change and

1028
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,320
and you would not even need to ask is

1029
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,140
for everything I called a sub truck

1030
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,780
which is a definitely well organized

1031
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,540
subset of the truck I wanted to call it

1032
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,119
a t-path or use your words I mean a path

1033
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,460
because that piece is deterministic it's

1034
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,760
well organized it's exactly that now the

1035
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,579
track is the collection of the model set

1036
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,480
of all the overlapping

1037
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,260
so you could I expect the PC to design

1038
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,900
five six seven ten path

1039
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,920
and place them in the same set which has

1040
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,540
all the links of all those paths if you

1041
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,780
like so so the links are the track

1042
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,339
and the PSC selects out of that subset

1043
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,380
which is the track on which we do oam

1044
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,760
and all those games all the time

1045
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,280
regardless of whether we use them or not

1046
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,339
the PSC selects a path

1047
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,980
inside that set the track is the set the

1048
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,839
path is what the PSC selects at one

1049
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,240
point of time that's that's my intention

1050
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,460
so I have this term subtract that I'm

1051
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,260
very very happy to remove because it's

1052
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,180
effectively in my mind matching what you

1053
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,319
define

1054
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,240
and and for exactly the reasons the

1055
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,339
exact reasons you say I want to do that

1056
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,040
change now for the track itself which is

1057
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,060
the set of all those things the the

1058
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,180
coalescence of all those t-path I think

1059
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,540
it's uh it's it's it's a little more we

1060
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,760
are stretching the term and I don't like

1061
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,920
to stretch your thumb even more mostly

1062
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,260
because at the end one is a set and the

1063
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,780
other one is is a t-path as you as you

1064
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,460
define it

1065
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,740
I'd really like to go find an old ccamp

1066
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,940
presentation

1067
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,619
so C Camp was created well no it is when

1068
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:30,480
it was rechartered and when T's broke

1069
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,200
off it was uh its scope was set to help

1070
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,680
new technologies reuse iatf traffic

1071
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,440
engineering uh techniques terminology

1072
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,880
Solutions

1073
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,460
and that old presentation talked about

1074
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,740
how it's very common for someone who has

1075
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,720
a new technology to show up

1076
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,119
spend a whole bunch of time adapting to

1077
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,160
what they think and saying okay we're

1078
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,079
we're ready to go this is our solve

1079
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,520
salute this is our solution it's time

1080
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,339
for an RFC and then to enter the c-camp

1081
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:02,700
group and that's the start of what ccamp

1082
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,960
does is help take what is this unique

1083
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,240
technology well from the perspective of

1084
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,619
those people who are coming in with the

1085
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,599
new technology here's a unique solution

1086
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,700
and saying how much of this solution is

1087
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,339
actually unique and how much is generic

1088
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,220
and part of the the process is is

1089
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,619
teasing out the terminology to get the

1090
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,780
terminology aligned with what's in it

1091
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,220
already there with ietf traffic

1092
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,560
engineering and then by getting the

1093
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,780
terminology right you help identify

1094
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,180
which mechanisms exist and clear used

1095
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,099
which mechanisms are brand new

1096
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,980
we are in them in that process now we're

1097
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,420
not quite at the very beginning we've

1098
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,980
been the working group's been running a

1099
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,660
little while but I don't think we've had

1100
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,940
that good synchronization and we would

1101
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,160
might benefit from talking to the Sea

1102
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,900
camp chairs and that C Camp working

1103
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,940
group and maybe even doing like a joint

1104
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,760
interim and say help us you know merge

1105
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,619
our now well-formed architecture

1106
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:00,180
document into ietf traffic engineering

1107
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,280
so we're repeating a process that we've

1108
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,740
seen many times for many different

1109
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,119
Technologies

1110
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,160
by the way microwave was one of them

1111
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,579
it's it's a it's a wireless technology

1112
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,680
that is point to point so you don't have

1113
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,060
overhearing you know so it has different

1114
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,560
characteristics than what you want but

1115
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,119
it's still Wireless so they've been down

1116
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,619
this path before I think we could

1117
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,420
benefit by trying to work more closely

1118
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,940
with them I mean I completely buy that

1119
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,400
it seems to me orthogonal to the fact

1120
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,040
that there's there's still this question

1121
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,579
whether the truck as I figure it

1122
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:34,140
is

1123
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,040
within what that net calls a path or if

1124
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,420
it's just a subtract that's being

1125
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,220
selected which is what that net calls a

1126
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,180
path

1127
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,760
so From a.net perspective we have

1128
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,339
something called a service the service

1129
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,099
may be supported by

1130
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,280
um a set a forwarding layer paths I

1131
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,200
agree with that and that there could be

1132
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,839
a protection function that Maps the

1133
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,660
service to those paths

1134
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,220
I see nothing here that you're

1135
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,380
describing as being different from that

1136
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,339
and there is I

1137
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:09,359
no I'm going to join the queue I'm going

1138
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,960
to join the queue

1139
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,200
but I need to cure your question because

1140
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,140
it's it's we are born it's all turning

1141
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,319
around the same problem

1142
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,740
so you want to speak first

1143
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,079
yes

1144
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,180
I have two comments the first I have

1145
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,880
really Deja

1146
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,220
vujabi sorry for my French

1147
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,839
um

1148
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:38,760
when we started in the death Network

1149
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,780
group

1150
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,960
TSM worker already done in 93 plea

1151
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,420
and we had exactly a very similar

1152
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,300
discussion those days because TSN

1153
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,819
already had the terminology

1154
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:56,220
in that net this was okay in in that

1155
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,579
we have not yet had the ietf terminology

1156
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:02,160
for all this stuff so there were lengthy

1157
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,800
discussion and and similar methods like

1158
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,040
like Loop reports uh we definitely had

1159
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,220
the luxury that having the TSN guys also

1160
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,339
in the room during the discussion and we

1161
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:16,200
have made that happen in the

1162
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,060
architecture document so there you can

1163
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,700
find also some IEEE technology and

1164
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,020
terminology and it is pointed exactly

1165
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,240
what is that net relation that the

1166
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,060
terminology relation to those

1167
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,040
terminologies so something similar here

1168
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,560
I think would would be excellent to that

1169
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,660
uh the the second comment is is about uh

1170
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,960
distract track story uh so I think in

1171
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,940
the document you have

1172
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,240
uh also complex path and then I have

1173
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,819
read the document yes my understanding

1174
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,920
was that it is it is describing your

1175
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,200
track terminology and then we have a

1176
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,839
terminology with path this is describing

1177
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,720
what you wanted to have with with that

1178
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,900
and and also also uh regarding

1179
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,859
the flows we have defined in that net

1180
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:10,500
the member flow and the compound flow

1181
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,619
which is of course on flow level but

1182
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,940
something very much related to that

1183
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,579
root just not to use track or path but

1184
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:23,160
root to take over the network for the

1185
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,859
packets belonging to a flow

1186
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:27,839
I can answer the second one first if you

1187
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,280
don't mind I think there is a bug in

1188
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,079
that net I try to raised it a number of

1189
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:31,980
times

1190
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,579
and the bug in that net is that there is

1191
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,859
a huge confusion between the water and

1192
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:39,000
the pipe

1193
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,880
the flow is the water that's what goes

1194
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,480
from A to B the pipe is quote unquote of

1195
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,180
this by path discussion it's where it's

1196
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,300
gonna go what's gonna happen to the

1197
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,839
packets on on the flight Etc

1198
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:58,020
um the the flow

1199
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,420
is in that net typically not the

1200
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,980
compound flow the base flow is is

1201
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,500
identified by the five tuples meaning it

1202
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,599
is a application layer construct the

1203
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,579
application decides what goes in the

1204
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:09,780
flow

1205
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,940
at some point there is and it's written

1206
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,440
like this in the architecture I know

1207
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,480
because I wrote it

1208
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,359
um that says at some point the flow is

1209
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,040
mapped to a path

1210
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,380
and that's intentional

1211
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,359
the intention is to say there is a

1212
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,700
function somewhere that we decide that

1213
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,339
this water goes in that pipe

1214
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:31,619
and the cool thing about separating the

1215
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,980
water and the pipe is that you can for

1216
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,200
instance decide that this oam goes in

1217
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,060
the same pipe will have the same

1218
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,880
treatment as this water so all of a

1219
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,460
sudden the OEM can absorb the water

1220
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,380
if we do things based on application

1221
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,300
signaling like the five tuples we are

1222
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,099
screwed because of a sudden we have all

1223
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,319
those plants hey how shall we put my OEM

1224
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,099
on the same falling operation you can't

1225
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:57,900
because you made that mistake of

1226
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,400
signaling stuff with the application I

1227
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,140
mean it's not your stuff that belongs to

1228
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,520
the application

1229
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,260
that's a bug

1230
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,780
so I I went to the mic several times

1231
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,900
tried to to say hey hey we confused the

1232
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,619
water and the pipe I wrote this uh IPv6

1233
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,380
that Network IPv6 document which I'm not

1234
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,940
maintaining but when when the group is

1235
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,380
finding interested in doing that I will

1236
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,059
be happy to revive it

1237
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:24,900
where I write this down in words and I

1238
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,440
show how IPv6 can signal not the flow

1239
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,880
because that's already what the

1240
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,040
application did in the packet but

1241
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,440
how you process it in the network which

1242
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,819
is the pipe

1243
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:39,000
so so don't tell me don't do what you do

1244
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,559
because we have this bug and we want you

1245
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,359
I want you to emulate this back it is a

1246
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,400
bug

1247
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,880
I I don't see it in that way because at

1248
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,540
the age node at the age uh of the that

1249
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,160
net domain you are just doing uh the

1250
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,960
death net flow identification so it is

1251
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,359
not an application related signaling

1252
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,760
this is something but but you are

1253
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,460
deciding at the age of the.net node and

1254
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,859
within the.net domain you are using

1255
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:13,098
those credentials to identify the flow

1256
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,680
you fix my back

1257
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,380
as long as we relate what that net does

1258
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,700
I'm not talking about the Ingress

1259
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,980
function that puts the data in I mean

1260
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,740
that exists but once we have decided

1261
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,599
that this thing goes in that pipe we

1262
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,339
should not be looking at the application

1263
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:34,200
information anymore we should signal our

1264
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,660
home pipes and if we put multiple pipes

1265
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,059
in a bigger pipe we just seen all that

1266
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,980
it's our one domain we can decide that

1267
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,260
we signal it and now the compound flow

1268
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,900
is just a pipe inside another pipe

1269
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,880
right so there is this first function

1270
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,579
first function that assigns the

1271
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:53,220
application layer stream to a pipe and

1272
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,079
then we are in our world and and that's

1273
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,520
what we need that's how we need to build

1274
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,339
that's that's an architecture and that

1275
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:02,099
net architecture is worded like this

1276
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,319
but but this is exactly about the flow

1277
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,980
identification functionality do at the

1278
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,319
age node yes the flow identification

1279
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,960
will record will have some mapping table

1280
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,040
of sort which will do several things

1281
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,960
um recognize the application flow if

1282
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,819
it's not if it's stacked by five double

1283
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:23,339
stacked by five double it will assign a

1284
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:25,980
path it will do some shaping if the flow

1285
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,260
doesn't respect you know the shape of

1286
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,359
the pipe because we insert that flow in

1287
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:32,760
that pipe the shaping must be correct so

1288
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,900
there are all those things which happen

1289
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,960
at the Ingress Edge and once that is

1290
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,900
done we should not see look observe

1291
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,540
think about any application layer

1292
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,059
signaling we are in our world and I

1293
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,980
don't think that that net specifications

1294
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,880
are clear and uh enough on that

1295
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,520
but at least my IPv6 hot by Hub document

1296
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,680
is very clear on that

1297
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,660
okay let's have further discussion on

1298
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,420
that uh maybe just one final comment is

1299
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,240
that uh in that net we have two data

1300
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,140
plane

1301
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,740
not only IPv6 we have also mpls data

1302
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,400
plan

1303
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,319
so

1304
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,020
but in mpls I'm sure that naturally you

1305
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,880
fix this bug because you label it's a

1306
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,380
label inside label so very soon you're

1307
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,660
in your own labels exactly and so by

1308
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,819
Nature even without thinking about it or

1309
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,980
wording it you kind of solve that

1310
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,140
problem

1311
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,540
but still a lot of the discussion I'm

1312
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,339
hearing and the all these things about

1313
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:32,299
five top also know

1314
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,520
lead to the impression that we have this

1315
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,099
back and I want to be very very clear in

1316
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:41,460
everything I write that I'm I'm not

1317
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,119
writing for that

1318
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,000
okay

1319
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,780
John Scutter Juniper Networks

1320
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,619
um

1321
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:57,300
so I

1322
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,339
somewhat regretfully want to return to

1323
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:01,800
the the previous conversation you are

1324
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,300
having with Lou

1325
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,940
where which you know made me think a

1326
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,460
little bit of Alice in Wonderland and

1327
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,819
you know a word is exactly what I mean

1328
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:14,400
it you know use it to mean neither more

1329
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,140
nor less

1330
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,619
um and I I also I still feel like a new

1331
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,660
guy in this group and like I kind of

1332
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,000
walked into the living room when the

1333
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,280
conversation is well underway

1334
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,059
um

1335
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,420
so you know forgive me as I continue to

1336
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,200
come up to speed but it it's sounded to

1337
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,119
me listening to you guys

1338
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:38,280
Converse like

1339
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,599
you're saying I really want to not reuse

1340
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,280
your words when they have a different

1341
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,540
shade of meaning from what I mean

1342
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,940
I already have a terminology set it

1343
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,220
means just what I want it to mean

1344
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,680
and um it's much easier for me to write

1345
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,520
a precise description of my architecture

1346
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,900
using the terminology that is precisely

1347
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,180
tailored for that purpose fair enough

1348
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,240
um I think what I heard Lou saying among

1349
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,220
other things was

1350
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,480
um

1351
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,020
we have a a terminology set that's

1352
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,900
really pretty close to what you mean and

1353
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,300
you if you use that it will make the

1354
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,460
document a lot more accessible to a

1355
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,119
wider audience

1356
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:29,400
um so Lou is doing his email so he can't

1357
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,140
say whether that's a

1358
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,240
a good description or not

1359
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,339
um anyway

1360
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:36,059
um

1361
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,680
and it seems to me like those are both

1362
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,220
good goals

1363
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,599
um it's obviously good for an

1364
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,700
architecture to be precise and

1365
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,819
unambiguous it's obviously good for an

1366
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:49,980
architecture to be accessible to a new

1367
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,480
reader

1368
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,020
um

1369
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,940
and it

1370
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,400
furthermore seems to me that with

1371
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,800
anything complicated the first time a

1372
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,660
new reader reads through it no matter

1373
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,900
how precise you have been in your

1374
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,180
choice of terms

1375
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,559
they're going to misunderstand something

1376
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:10,380
because that's human nature

1377
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,020
so it seems to me like one way of

1378
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,440
squaring the circle is

1379
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,200
and I'm sure that this has been part of

1380
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,359
the discussion maybe even right now

1381
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,480
um is to have a

1382
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,540
careful exhaustive and precise set of

1383
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,920
definitions

1384
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,339
and to say look you can't really

1385
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:35,400
understand the document unless you have

1386
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,500
understood and internalized all the

1387
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,180
definitions

1388
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,540
and applied them as you're reading the

1389
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,140
document right so you know you you got

1390
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,180
to expand all the pound defines sorry to

1391
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,740
date myself

1392
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,119
um

1393
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,460
trying to do that but I know I'm wrong

1394
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,200
already so I have some changes to make

1395
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,599
so but but at least I tried right no no

1396
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,880
and in fact there are big terminology

1397
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,980
sections explaining what they are how

1398
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,920
they differ in my view yeah but I I was

1399
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,740
wrong on something that luto told us so

1400
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,839
I know I have to fix it already right so

1401
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,180
so actually I I don't mean this as a as

1402
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,240
a criticism of the document as it stands

1403
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,579
I'm just sort of trying to set up

1404
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:20,280
one more thought which is once you've

1405
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,740
accepted that the only way that your

1406
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,420
document is really going to be properly

1407
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,339
understood is by somebody who has

1408
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,800
carefully read your definitions and is

1409
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,859
carefully applying them then you can use

1410
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:34,500
either terminology set right you can use

1411
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,420
your native terminology set

1412
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,079
that you have been thinking in you can

1413
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,900
use you know what is claimed to be the

1414
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,839
more common ietf terminology set which

1415
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,540
sort of the colloquial uses of it are

1416
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,220
let's just accept for discussion that

1417
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,819
those colloquial uses are subtly wrong

1418
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:56,880
but as long as that subtle wrongness

1419
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,400
doesn't like lead the the Casual reader

1420
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,780
down like a path to like deep

1421
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,680
misunderstanding I think it's okay

1422
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,140
because the Casual reader is just coming

1423
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,079
in and trying to get the big picture

1424
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,260
and you know sort of one in 50 casual

1425
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,520
readers are going to come back and read

1426
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,799
it four more times on their way to

1427
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,440
becoming experts

1428
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,000
um so it seems to me that you know if

1429
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,700
you're going to bias towards one thing

1430
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,680
or another

1431
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,020
um it's maybe more valuable

1432
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,480
to bias towards making the document

1433
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,119
accessible and towards really focusing

1434
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,380
on as you've done towards focusing on

1435
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,359
using definitions to make sure that your

1436
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,700
your meeting is completely clear

1437
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,400
um and I should have said up front that

1438
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,619
I'm you know don't intend to be in

1439
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,420
imposing any ads opinion here or

1440
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,740
anything this is just me sitting in the

1441
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,880
room listening

1442
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,540
thank you

1443
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,359
yeah so why I'm I am so sensitive to not

1444
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:02,220
giving that wrong impression to the

1445
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,700
Casual reader the big big thing with the

1446
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,500
way I see it works right because I it's

1447
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,240
not just the architecture I have my mind

1448
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,220
image of what's exactly going to happen

1449
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,559
what's going to happen is you've got

1450
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,299
this probably this PC I mean the

1451
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,099
distributed is in the architecture slow

1452
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:19,260
pointed but I don't I don't have any

1453
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,579
clue of how to make that work

1454
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,040
distributedly so so say you have this

1455
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,380
controller and the controller will

1456
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,400
observe the links every hub

1457
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,700
through a periodic statistical knowledge

1458
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,160
so every hour what's the ratio of

1459
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,859
delivery on that Hub so so it's going to

1460
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:39,900
get statistical values because it cannot

1461
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,420
get so many full pictures of exactly

1462
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,099
what's going on so it will have

1463
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,680
statistical views of all those links

1464
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,160
right and it will be asked to build

1465
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,640
something which allows every packet from

1466
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,760
a to Rich B like 2.5 times every packet

1467
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,920
should reach should arrive 2.5 times

1468
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,020
average something like that and you will

1469
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,180
say Okay 2.5 if I just build three

1470
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,980
parallel paths with all the laws and the

1471
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,740
statistics I get 1.1 which means that

1472
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,420
some packets would be lost

1473
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,240
not good enough so let me build more of

1474
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,319
those

1475
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,559
things now if I build too much yeah

1476
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,119
Spectrum energy blood that's why we're

1477
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:19,140
here

1478
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,640
okay but the PSC cannot be that smart as

1479
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,799
to decide if exactly on each packet

1480
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,500
which hops are going to be followed so I

1481
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,940
need to hint

1482
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,880
and that's that's the Orient thing in

1483
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,599
UDA I need to hint the PSC if you see

1484
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,819
this you do that

1485
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:42,900
and each of those that is a sub topology

1486
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,960
of the overall thing so the overall

1487
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,780
thing is all those extra links that the

1488
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,040
PC has decided may be used from A to B

1489
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,799
the PSC doesn't just give that it gives

1490
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,599
a set

1491
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,299
of T path

1492
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:03,359
each one mapping a certain condition of

1493
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,440
the network

1494
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,240
and I'm willing to call this thing

1495
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,760
t-path and I'm sorry I called that sub

1496
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,859
truck

1497
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,079
and so now I have a clear usage of the

1498
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:18,180
term t-path it is this subset now oam

1499
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,099
doesn't care only on that subset because

1500
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,380
we are doing out of Bando am as well to

1501
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,180
see if there is another path in that

1502
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,220
bigger thing that we could use better

1503
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,319
than what we are using currently

1504
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,660
Okay so

1505
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,940
we need to observe the big thing that I

1506
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,579
call the truck and use the sub thing

1507
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:38,339
which I call the t-path

1508
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:41,099
you see and so if I call the two of them

1509
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:42,960
the same thing how can I say what I

1510
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,420
observe versus what I use

1511
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,960
now back to lose point about yes it's

1512
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,140
just a service the service actually when

1513
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,619
I'm going to receive from the pce all

1514
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:58,500
those different cases I will instantiate

1515
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,260
a service for each of them because in

1516
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,720
runtime I will just use one of those

1517
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,240
services but in my code I will have one

1518
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,339
instance I will just say flip that one

1519
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:10,520
on flip that one off as the immediate

1520
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,260
reaction so each of the service the blue

1521
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,660
the red the green the whatever they will

1522
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,059
they will be activated and deactivated

1523
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:19,920
dynamically based on OEM that's exactly

1524
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,200
what's going to happen so for each of

1525
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,440
those Services I will have a t path so

1526
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,900
what I'm gonna do is activate the t-path

1527
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,640
deactivate that t-path that's exactly

1528
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,020
what's going to happen

1529
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,540
and then again I need to represent the

1530
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,880
set of all those T path and what I call

1531
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,680
coalitions is When You observe all of

1532
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,540
them from above and if you have twice

1533
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,160
the same link it looks like one but at

1534
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,040
the end you observe the set of all that

1535
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,079
that's the track that's the big thing on

1536
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,119
which the PSC is operating from this A

1537
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,440
to B

1538
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,500
and HTE path is what one of the servers

1539
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,000
gives me and I select which one I'm

1540
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,900
using

1541
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,240
confusing the two makes makes it very

1542
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,339
very hard for me to explain exactly what

1543
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:00,900
I told you

1544
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,619
thank you

1545
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:09,980
foreign

1546
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,499
[Music]

1547
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,980
[Music]

1548
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,020
ER since today the first time I came

1549
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,920
over

1550
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,280
because uh and then the first time I saw

1551
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,099
your terminology track it immediately

1552
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,079
comes to my mind in the tracking area

1553
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,819
that being used since this is the raw

1554
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:35,040
the radio the world is hard

1555
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,700
so that has a different uh meaning to

1556
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,859
tracking area okay probably are talking

1557
01:04:40,859 --> 01:04:44,099
about some set of sales I use the

1558
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:45,540
switching routing but in the wireless

1559
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,799
part

1560
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,960
okay and then I continue reading through

1561
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,540
and you talk about the six Pi SCI

1562
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,319
Channel

1563
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,619
and then okay so probably your and then

1564
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:57,000
you say okay well not introduce anything

1565
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,260
new

1566
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,420
and then oh yeah okay so probably for

1567
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,460
some base station and then on that side

1568
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,500
for the channel you're talking about the

1569
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,880
drv

1570
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,280
and then I continue reading and you say

1571
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,260
okay you statistically and combinational

1572
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,079
comment uh combinatory aggregation of

1573
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:14,940
the blah blah everything

1574
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:17,160
and then at that moment okay well you

1575
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,920
are talking about the PSE and going to

1576
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,599
determine a path

1577
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,780
so with for me I have both background

1578
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,299
when I read it it's the first impression

1579
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:29,819
I got is a little bit confused

1580
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:32,819
yeah can you help I mean and then

1581
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:34,380
basically my problem is that if you go

1582
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,780
explanation I fully understand but uh

1583
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,180
you know for I have background both and

1584
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,980
then the first time I got coffee that's

1585
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,260
wonderful because we are lacking this

1586
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,660
feedback because everybody here kind of

1587
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,980
understands what we've been working on

1588
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,599
for a long time and when I said that

1589
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:51,420
they made a rework to to try to make the

1590
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,700
new reader's life easier

1591
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,940
seems that I'm not through yet so if

1592
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,400
could you write down what you just said

1593
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,640
and maybe suggest you know how things

1594
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,220
could be reordered or where where you

1595
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,520
you add those times of confusion yeah

1596
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,859
well I try to um ask you one particular

1597
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:12,119
question we're gonna talk about the end

1598
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,180
to end are you only talk about up to the

1599
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,359
base station and Beyond on the layer 3

1600
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:20,280
part oh you're talking things you're

1601
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,200
talking this at the raw the radio the

1602
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,660
well the wireless part are you also

1603
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,420
mentioning from the UE all the way to

1604
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,420
the server the whole path

1605
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,420
okay so so there are two things here

1606
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,700
yeah one of them is there are two use

1607
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,099
cases in a row because that's the use

1608
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:39,960
cases that were presented to us in life

1609
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,339
and there might be a lot more to

1610
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:43,619
wireless than those two use cases and

1611
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:45,359
and you talk about UE and then base

1612
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,180
station so that's use case one when row

1613
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,700
protects the access only the access but

1614
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,099
it observes the end-to-end path so

1615
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:54,420
basically you get feedback from the

1616
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,799
other hand whether the packet was

1617
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:57,660
received but the only thing you really

1618
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,119
act on is the first top so if if the

1619
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:01,799
server doesn't get your data over

1620
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:04,260
Wireless Wi-Fi you'll go to 5G

1621
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,180
regardless if the problem is really with

1622
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,339
the Wi-Fi or if it is somewhere else

1623
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:10,619
right so that's when the oam is layer

1624
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:12,720
three and and the selection the action

1625
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,099
that you can take is just on the first

1626
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,660
half because the rest you don't control

1627
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,640
anyway

1628
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,039
um so so that's that's half of of the

1629
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,960
discussion

1630
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,359
um and so the other Alpha is what I lost

1631
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:25,079
myself

1632
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:26,760
what was the core of your question

1633
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,380
please I need to cover the thing here

1634
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,039
got the the PSE okay so from the IP and

1635
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:34,799
uh side I understand it's like uh like

1636
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,660
some place to calculate on the layer

1637
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,480
three the tunnel but the thing here if

1638
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,280
you look at the radio architecture

1639
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,299
especially 5G the layer 3 is uh you can

1640
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,339
consider you can consider under the

1641
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:48,720
genob side

1642
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,900
and then so for your internal pass yes

1643
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,500
the PS the PC discussion only applies to

1644
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,180
the second case in the architecture

1645
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,859
where you do the mesh

1646
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:00,780
so I told you that those two big use

1647
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,700
cases one of them is we protect the

1648
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,039
access only and even if the fault is not

1649
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,500
on the access we'll switch the access

1650
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,059
and the Second Use case is we have this

1651
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,299
mesh and we are looking at a multi-hop

1652
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,940
Wireless truck

1653
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,279
and that's when that's when all this

1654
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,640
discussion that we had happens where the

1655
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,100
PC will look at statistically blah and

1656
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,560
say use that well even on the

1657
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,479
the first use case the PC will tell you

1658
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,759
about the statistics of the links

1659
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,198
but

1660
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,600
it does not compute the end-to-end

1661
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,640
path that we are talking about it just

1662
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,560
says you switch this interface or that

1663
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,600
interface or that interface based on

1664
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,120
observable qualities or whatever so if

1665
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,979
you if you see for instance that your

1666
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:47,219
Wi-Fi reports that the speed is this or

1667
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:49,020
whatever you switch to 5G just an

1668
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,000
example that's the kind of reaction that

1669
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,060
the PC could tell to the end user the

1670
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,799
user equipment

1671
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:58,380
um let me just to make it very very

1672
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,679
clear here for your statistic

1673
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:03,540
terminology used to the track suppose

1674
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:07,319
this is the radio the 5G uh scenario on

1675
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,380
the down link from The genome B

1676
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,839
here when the Downing traffic come onto

1677
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:16,080
the genome B it's going to select based

1678
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,600
on the sum of 5qi it's going to select

1679
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,600
even the drbs the data radio barrier

1680
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,000
okay so that one is going to be well

1681
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,279
depending on the qls perform without

1682
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:27,359
being start

1683
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,779
that'll be uh the selection okay well

1684
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:33,839
it's not random it's not statistic but

1685
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,880
it's in the gr if the guarantee bit rate

1686
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,580
obviously non-gbr is credible something

1687
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:41,580
it might not yeah so for your statistic

1688
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,560
and then my understanding is like the

1689
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,660
track is some sort of like statistic

1690
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,420
combination such that you flip the coin

1691
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,100
and then you do something

1692
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,560
the statistics in the access case the

1693
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,420
statistics are obtained through the

1694
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,040
end-to-end oam

1695
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,980
and whatever did those two layer 2 does

1696
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,719
is not observed normally it's not

1697
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,460
observable we don't really have access

1698
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:05,940
to what layer 2 does so the the that is

1699
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,040
the use case where the oam is layer

1700
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,460
three from the client to the server and

1701
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,199
if that goes bad we just switch the

1702
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,140
radio okay but we don't know what better

1703
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,600
we don't even care if it's Wi-Fi or 5G

1704
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,820
okay sure thank you okay the first align

1705
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,739
just gave me the impression because this

1706
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:26,219
one use the similar like the 60i sh and

1707
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:28,199
we are not introducing anything new so

1708
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,420
okay I try to associate this too

1709
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,679
together

1710
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,620
but please keep in touch Clips please

1711
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,300
keep in touch I mean it's I mean

1712
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,239
anything that that creates

1713
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,580
an issue for the reader needs to be

1714
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,320
addressed

1715
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,020
so uh I'm in the Q next Rick Taylor uh

1716
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,659
with chair hat off really and Lou it's

1717
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:50,219
kind of a follow-up question to a

1718
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:51,780
statement you made earlier and I'm glad

1719
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,400
you're in the queue behind me

1720
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,300
going back to the track versus path

1721
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,800
question

1722
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,199
um

1723
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:02,640
this is we've got to get to the bottom

1724
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,219
of this so uh actually quick comment to

1725
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,440
concerning John's statement I'm I'm in

1726
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,719
complete agreement that

1727
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:11,400
um and this goes back to my idea that

1728
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,920
that we are a sibling group of debt Nets

1729
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,440
so making sure that

1730
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,239
if you come from a debt net background

1731
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,219
you can immediately

1732
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:23,280
understand because there is commonality

1733
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,100
of terminology but if specifics need to

1734
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,659
be pulled out in order to make a

1735
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:29,120
coherent argument

1736
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,860
that's absolutely fine

1737
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,679
and should be front and center so that

1738
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:37,260
it those differences can be noted so my

1739
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,420
question to Lou actually was

1740
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,280
given you have layers of service

1741
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,260
protection functions

1742
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,120
and effectively a service protection

1743
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,400
function

1744
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,640
does something to paths or hops you know

1745
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,320
you've earned it's going to be Parts I

1746
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,880
think where a service protection

1747
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,440
function which does some sort of

1748
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,140
duplication and and eliminate

1749
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,380
replication and elimination pairing

1750
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,460
so that service function is creating

1751
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:07,260
what do you call a link of service

1752
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,920
functions from end to end

1753
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,820
if a service function does something to

1754
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:18,239
makes choices between paths what what is

1755
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,460
what is that chain of service functions

1756
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,040
is that a service path

1757
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,140
and I think that does not exist in that

1758
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,900
not that I know of and I think that

1759
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,219
might be the Crux of the problem because

1760
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:31,800
we've got layers and we use the same

1761
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,340
word path right every slice through all

1762
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,080
the individual layers some which may or

1763
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,580
may not appear at different points

1764
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,980
across the thing

1765
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,380
yeah so we have a recursive architecture

1766
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,820
not an overlapping architecture okay

1767
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,159
it's a one layer can receive service

1768
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,679
from a lower layer and it can provide

1769
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:55,080
service to an upper layer each of those

1770
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,600
are services and you go to end to end if

1771
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,159
you look at the architecture document it

1772
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:00,719
says the n10 service

1773
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,580
it's really simple yeah and it's

1774
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,500
independent of how many services it

1775
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,120
traverses it's still the end-to-end

1776
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,280
service because when you're operating at

1777
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,360
a layer

1778
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,179
you see what layer you're operating at

1779
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,580
so switching you know the across the

1780
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,920
horizontal providing service up to the

1781
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,420
vertical where you know when you're

1782
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,820
going up vertically that's to the

1783
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,920
application and when you're going down

1784
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,300
you're going to get receiving service

1785
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,739
from the network

1786
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,780
usually represented as interface but you

1787
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,280
know there's lots of ways to implement

1788
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,260
that it's not standardized

1789
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,840
so if you're talking about the

1790
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,000
collection of services that's used to

1791
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,940
deliver traffic to a net application end

1792
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:39,840
to end

1793
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,120
n10 service it's in the architecture

1794
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,480
document yeah no that is fine

1795
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,040
sorry that's absolutely fine and I

1796
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,960
understand that but what I'm saying is

1797
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,300
as you start to talk about that from a

1798
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,840
technical perspective and you start to

1799
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,380
delaminate across these these

1800
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:02,040
recursively applied Services the layers

1801
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,260
if you're talking about a particular

1802
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:06,960
service function which says oh there may

1803
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,520
be a service above me there's almost

1804
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,080
definitely a service below me it may

1805
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,679
just be forwarding I have a pairing with

1806
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,960
you know a replication and elimination

1807
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,580
you have a pair one replicates one

1808
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,400
Eliminator protection domain yeah you

1809
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,020
have a protection domain

1810
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,540
so the the relationship between those

1811
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,980
two they exist within a protection

1812
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,679
domain but the the

1813
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:31,020
the transit of packets from the

1814
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,300
replicator to The Eliminator function

1815
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,719
yes does that have a name or is it it's

1816
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,460
the end and service at that layer

1817
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,219
it's a recursive architecture so these

1818
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:46,739
are so a particular layer

1819
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:48,900
if you were providing a service it's

1820
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,239
your end-to-end service to your

1821
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,040
application it's not their intent so if

1822
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,199
I understand your argument correctly and

1823
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,480
I I think I think I understand what

1824
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,800
you're saying but I'm trying to see if

1825
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,900
we can apply it could we just replace

1826
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,000
the word Trek

1827
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,340
we then to end service because we're

1828
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,800
talking about I believe I really believe

1829
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,980
so and to John's characterization of

1830
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,300
what I was saying

1831
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,980
there's one additional point that I

1832
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,960
think is really the Crux of where I'm

1833
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,480
coming from is if we can figure out the

1834
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,480
aligned terminology we can figure out

1835
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,420
what technology we can reuse I think

1836
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,920
that's understandable and then what

1837
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,320
technology what new mechanisms we have

1838
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,000
to Define because I think there is

1839
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,120
something new here

1840
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,739
that's that's that's the thing to do so

1841
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:36,960
what we want to do is tease down to

1842
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,880
what's new and then reuse as much as we

1843
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,640
can and that's the whole concept that

1844
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,100
you know in bot is embodied in Internet

1845
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,860
te and T's and c-camp and and all that

1846
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,460
prior work

1847
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,460
and there's one additional point I'd

1848
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,500
like to make this is a separate point

1849
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,480
well actually you're the one in queue

1850
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,179
and I'm responding yeah yeah sorry when

1851
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:02,159
you're done I'll make my point okay so

1852
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,739
oh God you just interrupted me so and

1853
01:16:04,739 --> 01:16:07,500
this is kind of a question to Pascal now

1854
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,040
if you call it a end-to-end service at a

1855
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,620
particular layer is that a pipe or is

1856
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,420
that still a flow because I agree with

1857
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,820
you on pipes I actually do agree with

1858
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,679
you on pipes and it's I know that's a

1859
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,600
TechNet consideration not particularly a

1860
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,280
raw one I think there's a big difference

1861
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,860
look at this picture okay

1862
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:33,900
we we spent some time yesterday on that

1863
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,219
picture I'm sorry for the rest of the

1864
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:37,380
group uh

1865
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,320
but I I presented it at the last iatf

1866
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,080
I'm it's very hard to build it's a very

1867
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,060
simple picture but it's very hard to

1868
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:45,960
build

1869
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,580
what it's trying to say is that the PSC

1870
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:53,580
operates outside of the flow of the

1871
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,679
packets remember it's something which

1872
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,900
will switch from Service Blue to service

1873
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,699
Red because the radio conditions

1874
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,040
somewhere have changed

1875
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,739
and you could see it as a fork of packet

1876
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:06,840
but no because it's not in the data

1877
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,179
plane that's my answer to you and Lou

1878
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:12,600
that's why I say no it's because this

1879
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,699
thing happens asynchronously to the

1880
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:18,060
traffic this happens in this oam plane

1881
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,860
if we really want to to have an oem

1882
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,440
plane where we will switch the service

1883
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,659
but the next packet will only see one

1884
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:26,699
service on the path of the packet there

1885
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:28,679
won't be a service selection that will

1886
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:31,800
and then a sub service selection so the

1887
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,719
package will just see blue service if

1888
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:35,040
you don't even know there was a red

1889
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,719
surface sorry Rick yes I completely

1890
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,760
agree with you go on so when you're

1891
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,400
switching between services in the detnet

1892
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,780
architecture you're actually switching

1893
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,340
between forwarding paths because

1894
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,320
remember it's recursive yeah exactly so

1895
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,540
if

1896
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,820
if I'm an application

1897
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:54,239
operating at whatever layer I have below

1898
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:56,400
me yes different services

1899
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,699
but then if I go below that layer below

1900
01:17:58,699 --> 01:18:01,199
those each one of those is its own

1901
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,760
service

1902
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,920
so it you really I think you're saying

1903
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,000
you're not switching between Services

1904
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,380
you're switching between forwarding

1905
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,260
paths in the recursive architecture

1906
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,719
I I think it would be super helpful

1907
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,120
to draw the same picture for a wired

1908
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,260
Network

1909
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,179
we have a protection switching function

1910
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:21,320
in uh defined for

1911
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,060
detnet we have one the architecture

1912
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,100
allows any

1913
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,140
so we could have a one for n service

1914
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,239
defined in bednet we don't we only have

1915
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,159
a one one plus one

1916
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,840
but that is a type of switching function

1917
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,760
that's a type of PSE

1918
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,920
now it's a very sorry no I don't believe

1919
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,960
that is what Pascal is saying I don't

1920
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,540
believe that's a PSE I think a PSE is a

1921
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,480
purely control plane mechanism that

1922
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,640
decides what switching function should

1923
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,420
be applied you switch the service

1924
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:53,100
applicator and the function that is

1925
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,000
being

1926
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,900
popped in line and I hear you yeah so in

1927
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,320
detnet it's a very rigidly controlled

1928
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,280
PSE controlled by a Yang model and it's

1929
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,560
expected to be driven by a provisioning

1930
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,420
system but there's no reason that

1931
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:12,239
couldn't be driven by you know take your

1932
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:15,120
AIML system that automatically changes

1933
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,980
it based on what it sees is you know the

1934
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:19,020
weather pattern of the network if you

1935
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,300
reach Roland when you do that or a thing

1936
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,800
called a piece I'm sorry I didn't hear

1937
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,420
what he said no I'm saying yeah and

1938
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,060
that's that's this could be included in

1939
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,800
what we discussed that's when you reach

1940
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,300
Roland that the extension we want to

1941
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,300
provide or the most additional

1942
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,400
refinement we want to bring to that net

1943
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,560
all you're discussing it's it's so I

1944
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,420
think all of what I've just said is in

1945
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,360
that net today

1946
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,980
does not discuss it does not prevent it

1947
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,739
we want to I think model fully supports

1948
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:49,380
what we've talked about I think that the

1949
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,900
architecture defines different ill

1950
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,100
allows for different protection

1951
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,320
mechanisms we've only defied one we've

1952
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,000
always talked about we may be doing

1953
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,520
others we identify Network coding as

1954
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,920
maybe the second but it's a maybe second

1955
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,140
we're contribution driven so if someone

1956
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,600
came with something new you know we

1957
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,340
could talk about that but I think from

1958
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,080
an architectural standpoint you're not

1959
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,120
adding something fundamentally new

1960
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,219
you're adding a new protection switching

1961
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:16,920
which already fits into the demo we are

1962
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,480
switching the protection switching under

1963
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,460
the carpet that's what that's great I'm

1964
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:21,980
just saying

1965
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:25,020
in the same plane because we are doing

1966
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,219
it

1967
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:28,199
that's that's why that picture is

1968
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,640
important what you're saying is all true

1969
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,860
but at the end of the day how can we

1970
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,900
Express in this document

1971
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,179
that we are not

1972
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:39,360
folding plane we are not doing steps in

1973
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,120
the lay going through layers for the

1974
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,980
packet operation there is only one layer

1975
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,960
or this is a service well and then and

1976
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,460
then going down to Fourth but we never

1977
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:50,340
go through the control layer for the

1978
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,020
packet processing right and we need to

1979
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,880
expose that to the reader yeah so I

1980
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,360
don't think we're arguing about

1981
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,400
the net effect and the behavior on The

1982
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,400
Wire right we're talking about we're

1983
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,320
arguing about how to represent it on

1984
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,560
paper so it's more accessible to the

1985
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,960
reader as well as

1986
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,380
allows us to reuse existing mechanisms

1987
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,420
documentation so we can reference rather

1988
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,739
than have to define a whole new set of

1989
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:17,820
things that's what we're really talking

1990
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,380
about right

1991
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:22,739
I'm suggesting take this picture draw it

1992
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,420
for Wired

1993
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,699
however you see to do it draw it for

1994
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,920
Wired and then next to it say here's how

1995
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,040
it how it's modified for raw and I agree

1996
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,719
that we don't actually have this picture

1997
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:37,140
drawn for detnet now I did drop and chat

1998
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,219
something from a long time ago which was

1999
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:42,960
mplstp talking about how to do it for

2000
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,060
Wired networks and mpls and remember

2001
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,920
that net inherits all of that because

2002
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,820
that's much more refined so

2003
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,940
the point is is that or my point is that

2004
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:56,340
that type of thing exists for Wired

2005
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,300
already it doesn't matter I mean yes it

2006
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,560
does and that proves that we are doing

2007
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,199
the right thing right but at the same

2008
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:06,719
time we still need to to show our

2009
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,219
readers what we are doing even if it

2010
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:10,860
already exists that's exactly but let's

2011
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,960
show it first for.net so people can

2012
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,380
understand what is there already can I

2013
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,600
connect and then add into it what is

2014
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,280
different can I just interrupt for a

2015
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,760
second just I think we've started to

2016
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,620
move on to

2017
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,860
a PSE discussion rather than getting to

2018
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:32,699
the bottom of the track issue or do you

2019
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:35,820
believe that they are so intertwined

2020
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,800
that they that we need to continue this

2021
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,600
time

2022
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,159
I was responding to the slide that was

2023
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:43,620
brought up and so you know I bought it

2024
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,000
because I thought it was intertwined

2025
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,640
sorry okay that's fine I'm sorry there

2026
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,199
was chair hat on there just trying to

2027
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:52,080
because I I think they're separable uh

2028
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,420
but you know I I

2029
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,219
he's the one driving slides he's the one

2030
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:57,659
showing a slide so I'm responding to the

2031
01:22:57,659 --> 01:23:00,480
slide the reason why I think and it's

2032
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,300
it's me right I mean we have a room so

2033
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,440
is that for me all the T discussion

2034
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,239
works

2035
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:11,699
also all the existing terminology we

2036
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:13,080
have in that net and that relates to

2037
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,840
draw it for that net if I was to draw it

2038
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,900
for that net I would basically say hey

2039
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,920
we have

2040
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,080
but the service access point exists in

2041
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,060
that net it's in the model Etc and

2042
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:36,300
that's neat that's perfect now this we

2043
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,520
have this new user which is effectively

2044
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,920
not the one we expected when we wrote

2045
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,659
initially the architecture but the

2046
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:45,179
architecture is open to having it and

2047
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:47,760
now row is introducing that new consumer

2048
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,880
to this uh providers app

2049
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,040
so you're actually taking me to the

2050
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,900
point that I wanted to come up and

2051
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,420
actually make my point which is

2052
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:59,580
um we have an art it's true we have an

2053
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,260
architecture document you wrote A lot of

2054
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,179
it but what came through the working

2055
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:05,880
group is what the ietf agreed to

2056
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,580
and I've had this set to me by the way

2057
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:11,040
for documents that I've written is it

2058
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,659
doesn't matter what I wanted it to say

2059
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:15,600
it says what it says yeah so we have to

2060
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,000
accept that that's what the ietf

2061
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,060
standardized yeah so you know I I've

2062
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,679
heard you say a couple of times I know I

2063
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:23,820
wrote that and this is what it should

2064
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:24,840
say

2065
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,480
doesn't matter it says it and again I'm

2066
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,800
saying something to you that was said to

2067
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,800
me previously as an author I take it

2068
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,659
nicely I mean no issues with that it's

2069
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:35,219
just a matter of that steals the weather

2070
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:36,780
right wrong

2071
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,120
that's what was standardized or agreed

2072
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,739
upon because it's not a standard it's an

2073
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:42,239
inferential document exactly I close

2074
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:43,400
right yeah

2075
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,140
I still understand the words in a

2076
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,820
slightly different fashion so we might

2077
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,199
both think we agree with the

2078
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,760
architecture and we might still have a

2079
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,560
different image of what it is I I agree

2080
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,080
with you completely and that goes to the

2081
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,000
next point which is

2082
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,580
different protection functions from my

2083
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:01,739
my perspective as a reader I don't think

2084
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:03,420
I was an author on that I did comment a

2085
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,400
lot but I don't think I was an author

2086
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,340
um I saw the ability to do any number of

2087
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,739
protection functions you should take it

2088
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,480
very abstractly we understand how I read

2089
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,380
it

2090
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,420
and that's you know I and I saw that

2091
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,219
there was even multiple examples listed

2092
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:18,420
in the document

2093
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,920
so the fact that you have another one

2094
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,920
which is interesting and tailored to a

2095
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,020
wireless network that's great it fits

2096
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,000
right in the architecture

2097
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,640
okay so where we seem to converge at

2098
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,800
least I can

2099
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,140
agree with what you said is this is a

2100
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,920
protection function I agree with that

2101
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,100
I don't agree that it is a service layer

2102
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,840
function because the way we Define the

2103
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,640
service layer it's a forwarding plane

2104
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,320
activity that's why I brought this slide

2105
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,320
that's service when you could it's a

2106
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,540
control domain service if you like but

2107
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,219
it's not the services that we have today

2108
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:54,900
because the only service that we Define

2109
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,000
and where we placed it we placed it in

2110
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,800
the forwarding plate

2111
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,840
and because this thing is in the control

2112
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,260
oam or whatever plane you want

2113
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,620
then it doesn't fit unless we take our

2114
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,540
definition of service and extend it to

2115
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,600
control plane activity so it's that's

2116
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,659
that's that's the thing but it is it is

2117
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:18,600
uh what you said it is a Protection

2118
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,000
Service it just doesn't live in this the

2119
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,980
forwarding plane like the services do

2120
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,800
go ahead Don all right

2121
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,360
um

2122
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,500
I

2123
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,960
I think that like you've spent a lot of

2124
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,239
time on this and and

2125
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,820
but you've you've you've taken a Step

2126
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:42,000
Beyond what what uh

2127
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,980
some of us can keep up with with a new

2128
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,980
terminology I would suggest like lose

2129
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:49,440
the term track and describe it in like

2130
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,300
you like you have the definition in

2131
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,280
terms of a path you know whether it's an

2132
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,500
aggregated path or a collection of paths

2133
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,880
or whatever

2134
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,280
and let the working group decide if

2135
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,739
there's a term that we need to describe

2136
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:04,800
that in the end and and for a couple of

2137
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,719
the new terminologies do the same thing

2138
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,360
and that would add Clarity to the

2139
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,460
document for me because

2140
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,699
a conceptually I'm not driving with it

2141
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:17,940
when I see a track and I'm sure a few

2142
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:20,219
others have the same problem but if we

2143
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:22,320
use all the same terminology that we've

2144
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,420
used before and maybe it's a big bunch

2145
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,460
of words that we have to use for this

2146
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,980
version of the draft and we would decide

2147
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:31,260
that we want a term that just describes

2148
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,659
that then I think we would we would

2149
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:37,980
reach uh a consensus on this faster

2150
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:42,600
uh that's very wise advice thank you

2151
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,580
um I'm next in the queue so I'm I'm

2152
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,460
gonna sort of go back to the argument

2153
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:49,199
not the the polite discussion between

2154
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,840
Lou and Pascal here

2155
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,179
the splitting of the document I think

2156
01:27:54,179 --> 01:27:58,620
was uh made to separate

2157
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:01,860
the pario service function

2158
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:06,239
from the pse's role in the architecture

2159
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,639
because I agree with Pascal here they

2160
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,980
are two separate things and I think

2161
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:14,040
where I disagree with Lou is I believe

2162
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,080
he's telling me that they're just one

2163
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,639
thing

2164
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:20,159
I that's what I'm picking up Lou I I if

2165
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,179
that's not what you're trying to say

2166
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:26,280
as you said it

2167
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,500
that has their service Control Function

2168
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,480
Yang

2169
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,380
modelsburger I

2170
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:34,020
you ask me are they the same I said I

2171
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,520
think they're separate and I just

2172
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,139
switched to it because he switched to it

2173
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:38,460
on his slide

2174
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,460
right okay fine in which in which case I

2175
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,100
I withdraw my previous comment about my

2176
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,360
understanding of what you were saying so

2177
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,040
again I should say that's what I meant

2178
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,420
to say I actually have no idea what I

2179
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:49,739
said

2180
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:52,679
welcome to my world

2181
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:55,020
yeah we'll consult the minutes

2182
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,080
um

2183
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:00,060
fundamentally there's there's the uh

2184
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,820
beautifully young modeled uh detnet

2185
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:05,639
service a Control Function or service

2186
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:06,719
control model

2187
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,380
and as I understand it the PSE

2188
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:15,239
can be a user of that in order to change

2189
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:18,540
service function based on some

2190
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,040
management and monitoring information

2191
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,960
that flows across the control plane

2192
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,639
policy whatever

2193
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:27,659
that is a unique decision or a unique

2194
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:30,360
part of the raw architecture because

2195
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,159
Pascal and the working group by

2196
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,300
extension this is a working group

2197
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,719
document proposed that that fast

2198
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,659
feedback loop is important in order to

2199
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:41,639
supply deterministic Services across

2200
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:44,400
Wireless links

2201
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,620
that is different from

2202
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,659
by the way we think we can produce a

2203
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:50,880
service function which will give you

2204
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,360
better reliability

2205
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,639
across whether we call it a path to

2206
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,040
track a stream of flow I don't care

2207
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,639
um

2208
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:04,159
within the debt net service sub layers

2209
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,300
and splitting those two documents may

2210
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:09,120
help clarify that does anyone disagree

2211
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,520
with me on that Pascal are my miles off

2212
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,760
here

2213
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:15,840
if I understand you well like I'm not

2214
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,000
sure I understand

2215
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,920
but if if I understand you well I'm with

2216
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,639
you

2217
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,739
Burger sorry I'm not in queue I just

2218
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:25,320
want fast enough with the app

2219
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:28,620
um your words just maybe remember that

2220
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,080
we spent a huge amount of time

2221
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,900
um going over these drawings of

2222
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,880
protection models as we were developing

2223
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,800
the Yang model to make sure we were

2224
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,420
appropriately modeling what the data

2225
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:40,639
plane could do

2226
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,239
and

2227
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,760
um Don was involved in that I was seeing

2228
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,040
if Don had a pointer to any of those but

2229
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,860
maybe we can grab those and uh give it

2230
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:51,540
to the working group here and then we

2231
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,280
can start extending them to draw the

2232
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,500
pictures of what we mean and then we can

2233
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,480
say we're pointing right here and this

2234
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,460
is the new thing or we're pointing here

2235
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,679
and this is the existing thing I think

2236
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,179
that would be very welcome because both

2237
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:05,159
Pascal and I had a corridor conversation

2238
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:06,780
where we admitted neither of us like

2239
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,639
drawing ASCII art and we both struggled

2240
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,020
no these are PowerPoint they're not

2241
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,659
asking but we I bet we can find a tool

2242
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:14,460
that will turn them into ASCII but

2243
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,980
anything to help with clarifying

2244
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,080
diagrams I think we're so in the realm

2245
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,940
of a picture is worth a thousand words

2246
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,920
here so yeah I'll see if I can dig it up

2247
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,600
or Donald dig it up and we'll send it to

2248
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,179
the list since since Lou you brought up

2249
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:29,159
the young model first things down for

2250
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:31,500
the ug front and you know that that's

2251
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,440
huge I mean if that contributed on the

2252
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,880
meaning list but that's that's a huge

2253
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:40,199
thing now a model gives you

2254
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:43,260
what you can use and not how you can use

2255
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:46,020
it that is the architecture which will

2256
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,340
tell you what you can do and what you

2257
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,020
cannot do for instance the model of a

2258
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,520
car will tell you that if you press the

2259
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,440
pedal it's going to go faster it doesn't

2260
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,480
tell you whether or not you go when the

2261
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,219
light is red or green that's the

2262
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,480
architecture

2263
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:01,739
and so because the young model could be

2264
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:05,460
is wide enough to do stuff doesn't mean

2265
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:08,400
that we we do all those stuff that the

2266
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,260
young model allows but we wanted the

2267
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,580
young model to allow everything you want

2268
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:12,360
to do

2269
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,719
but it cannot necessarily be limitating

2270
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:19,440
to the to to to what we allow so so did

2271
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,300
there is a role of the young model and

2272
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,620
there is the role of the architecture

2273
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,300
and the thing that tells you that if the

2274
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,520
red is lie is the light is red you stop

2275
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:29,100
that's the architecture so Pascal can I

2276
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,320
reply to that um I I think you're

2277
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,139
slightly meshing two concepts together

2278
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:36,540
there what I meant to say was in an

2279
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,360
architecture document you can say there

2280
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,659
is this well-defined control path

2281
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:46,800
between the uh service control functions

2282
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,040
down to the services themselves we are

2283
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,020
very lucky that there is a good quality

2284
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,880
Yang model that can describe that and in

2285
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,800
the architecture we can say we are going

2286
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,020
to use this it exists and people

2287
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,360
familiar with the prior work will go aha

2288
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,639
that is perfect that I was not

2289
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,199
responding to that because I agreed with

2290
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:06,179
that oh okay fine I was responding to

2291
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:09,000
Lou saying the way the service is

2292
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,940
modeled in Yang although the service to

2293
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:14,159
be kind of a maybe a control plane thing

2294
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,840
I don't know if that's exactly if he

2295
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,639
does that because I've not been enough

2296
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:21,560
detail this document study

2297
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,520
so so for me

2298
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,940
it's fine that if the model allows that

2299
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:29,100
it doesn't mean that we use that what

2300
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,719
what we use is what the architecture

2301
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,900
says we use right even if the model is I

2302
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:34,980
mean the model has to represent

2303
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:37,139
everything we could do and and the

2304
01:33:37,139 --> 01:33:39,000
architecture says everything we do

2305
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,940
hopefully the young model is a superset

2306
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:46,139
of of that yeah and not a subset so Don

2307
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:47,760
are you still in the queue or have you

2308
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,580
uh okay I'll bring you out of the queue

2309
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:54,080
Stu you're in the queue

2310
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,020
yeah Stu card and I'm not sure which of

2311
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:01,260
my affiliations I want to tag on this

2312
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,659
um so I'd just like to give a

2313
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:06,480
perspective of a noob

2314
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:11,100
um I have attempted to parse the net

2315
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,800
documents and I have attempted to parse

2316
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,780
the raw documents

2317
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:18,659
and despite what is obviously an

2318
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:21,920
enormous amount of work by both groups

2319
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,719
and an enormous amount of intelligence

2320
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,000
underneath that work

2321
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,400
I find neither of them particularly

2322
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,920
accessible to a newbie such as myself

2323
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,020
okay

2324
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,280
they appear to be

2325
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,340
things that probably can be read easily

2326
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,199
by someone who is involved in the work

2327
01:34:40,199 --> 01:34:41,880
from the first and can trace its

2328
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,639
Evolution and not so easily read by

2329
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:46,500
someone who was not involved in the work

2330
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,300
from the first and is coming in late and

2331
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:52,520
trying to wrap his head around this okay

2332
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,520
so from that perspective I have some

2333
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,580
sympathy for uh what Lou is saying about

2334
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,800
trying to make them more accessible

2335
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,080
on the other hand

2336
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,280
um

2337
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,820
I I do like precision

2338
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:12,659
um and by the way we already in ietf and

2339
01:35:12,659 --> 01:35:16,440
even in irtf abuse the word path okay if

2340
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,179
you go to the mathematical graph Theory

2341
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:23,280
we have walks Trails traces circuits

2342
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,080
Etc et cetera Etc right it'll be a long

2343
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,179
time to find track

2344
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:31,199
I went through the dictionary right so

2345
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,060
um so to draw an example from a

2346
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,800
different area with an ietf locator

2347
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,199
identifier split you know there's hip

2348
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,420
there's ilnp there's lisp and there's

2349
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:42,120
probably others okay and each introduces

2350
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,820
its own set of nomenclature which on the

2351
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:47,040
one hand is annoying but on the other

2352
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:50,639
hand uh not only are they potentially

2353
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,199
attempting to address a different set of

2354
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:53,820
requirements even to the extent that

2355
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:54,900
they address the same set of

2356
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,179
requirements they may partition and

2357
01:35:57,179 --> 01:35:58,739
allocate those requirements to different

2358
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:00,360
subsystems within the overall system

2359
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,120
architecture and the use of the same

2360
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,940
term to refer to a box that over here on

2361
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,340
the left includes a b and c and over

2362
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,520
here on the right includes b c and d I

2363
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,500
think ultimately can be more confusing

2364
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,620
than attempting to reuse terminology

2365
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:18,239
thus I come down on the side of

2366
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:22,020
introduce terms that will be very

2367
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,420
precise in their definitions but you

2368
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:25,800
know there's a sentence that could go

2369
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,020
early on that could it could make this a

2370
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,960
lot easier you could literally say in

2371
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,940
the Raw document

2372
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:36,060
this is what we really mean by track

2373
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,280
but if it makes it easier for you on a

2374
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,280
first read to think path every time you

2375
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,800
see the word track that's fine on a

2376
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,260
first read but on a second read it will

2377
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:48,960
be very important that you distinguish a

2378
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,719
track from a path

2379
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,659
thank you stu that's good advice I try

2380
01:36:54,659 --> 01:36:56,340
to do that

2381
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,560
and actually this discussion today

2382
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,380
clarified my own mind a lot

2383
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,900
even from what I'm I don't even know I'm

2384
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,179
thinking right because having to express

2385
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:08,760
it to you guys helped me sort out my own

2386
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,139
thoughts

2387
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:12,900
but the reason why I brought this Slide

2388
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:15,000
the reason why I think it's santankold

2389
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,360
it's because in my view what we call

2390
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,820
service and service layer is forwarding

2391
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:22,139
play

2392
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:25,920
since PSE is control plane I didn't see

2393
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,659
that as a service stacked over another

2394
01:37:27,659 --> 01:37:29,219
service

2395
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:30,540
and

2396
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,580
I completely agree with what Lou said

2397
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,260
about recursive for instance what we

2398
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,900
call compound flows and for me it's just

2399
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,239
tunnels within tunnels kind of if you

2400
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:41,460
want to visualize it just a bigger pipe

2401
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,159
where you have smaller pipes in it

2402
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,440
this is service between service because

2403
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,239
the bigger pipe has its own service

2404
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,900
layer so certainly you you Nest service

2405
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,199
layers when you do compound flows you do

2406
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,280
that

2407
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,540
um but

2408
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,420
the operation the packet sees that

2409
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:03,239
operation the packet fails every of

2410
01:38:03,239 --> 01:38:05,219
those operations the packet doesn't fill

2411
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:06,780
the PSE

2412
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,239
the PSC has been done under the carpet

2413
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:11,820
while the packet was not looking

2414
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:14,699
okay and and that's the reason why it's

2415
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:16,260
not falling plane and that's the reason

2416
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,840
why I don't call it service now if we

2417
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:23,100
decide that we have control planes

2418
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:23,699
um

2419
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:26,880
reliability Services as well as data

2420
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,159
plane reliability Services all of us

2421
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,500
then we agree right so so my question is

2422
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,239
really what we Define service layers oh

2423
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:35,820
it's all right but but I want to be

2424
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,820
honest to this drawing and then again it

2425
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:41,219
looks simple I mean loose drawing on

2426
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:43,620
nprs was very very complicated but

2427
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:45,659
making simple is hard

2428
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:47,639
actually and I spent a lot of time

2429
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:49,860
making that simple thing out of the much

2430
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,679
bigger thing with a lot more stuff in it

2431
01:38:52,679 --> 01:38:54,600
which looked so intelligent by the way

2432
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,900
but

2433
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:01,080
I think sorry I'm terrible with

2434
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,520
pronunciation you're in the queue go

2435
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,699
ahead

2436
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,040
um hi this is joseon Pascal thank you

2437
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,520
for your uh explanation just uh because

2438
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,699
as the quarter of the uh then the yellow

2439
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:21,840
mode or I just want to uh ask some

2440
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,540
clarification questions to make me more

2441
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:27,840
uh clear what do you try to describe

2442
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,560
about the PSE uh I just read through the

2443
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,020
document about the concept and the

2444
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,020
description does it mean that is a

2445
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:40,800
control Loop it does it mean that uh the

2446
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,239
PSE itself includes the uh oam process

2447
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:47,940
and the controller plan process and also

2448
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:50,820
the uh maybe something like forward

2449
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:55,199
implant or service layer often that no

2450
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:58,139
it's the combination no the PSC is this

2451
01:39:58,139 --> 01:40:00,420
little box on the top left

2452
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,159
of that screen

2453
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:04,920
and the PSC talks to somebody who

2454
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:08,400
represents what who I am finds which I

2455
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,139
call the oam supervisor or something

2456
01:40:10,139 --> 01:40:12,239
just that thing which sits in the

2457
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:13,980
control plane that observes the oim

2458
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,719
activity and get reports from OEM

2459
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:18,060
activities so it knows something

2460
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,500
happened on the other side of the

2461
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,139
network now PSC needs to take action so

2462
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:24,960
PSE is just this and it's written you

2463
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,480
know if you look at the uh again that's

2464
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:31,020
why I like this UDA reference model it's

2465
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,320
because the PSC is the one that does the

2466
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:38,340
D the decide the PSC decides

2467
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:42,659
right but the u o o uh and a

2468
01:40:42,659 --> 01:40:45,719
are are done by other uh other nodes

2469
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:48,659
other components on this of this control

2470
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:50,400
Loop the control Loop globally is

2471
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,000
abstracted as these four letters

2472
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,560
and and the PC is the d i if it helps I

2473
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,540
like to think of the PSE as a small

2474
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:07,100
stupid local pce

2475
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,080
it's an extension it may not be small or

2476
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,360
stupid but it's probably quite local I'm

2477
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,719
working on a on a fast loop in in the

2478
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:19,380
initial view we'll make it very stupid

2479
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:22,800
I have Rogers on how to make it more

2480
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,780
distributed in which case it could

2481
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:27,719
become a bit more intelligent but for

2482
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:31,020
now see it as a source routed multipath

2483
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:34,020
type of activity

2484
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:37,500
um it seems to me like PSE is part of

2485
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,199
the control Loop and it is kind of the

2486
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:42,360
connection between the OEM and the

2487
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,360
forwarding plan yes OEM is the observe

2488
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:49,739
the O in UDA yeah uh-huh and it does the

2489
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:55,080
decision kind of like uh pce yes okay I

2490
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,860
I try to understand the PC is the Orient

2491
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:01,320
and Orient is the only letter that is

2492
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,679
intelligent in the UDA Loop Orient is

2493
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:06,060
the one that has some historical

2494
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,800
understanding for instance the

2495
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,400
statistics that we bring to the PC so it

2496
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,860
knows this link is feeble this link is

2497
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:16,139
solid so when I construct those

2498
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:18,600
alternate paths I will rely more on this

2499
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,119
one than on that one and expect that

2500
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:22,739
this one fails in which case I've

2501
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:24,600
prepared discipline B for you which is

2502
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:27,179
service Red

2503
01:42:27,179 --> 01:42:29,400
okay thank you for the explanation I

2504
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:33,179
think I understand it more but I think I

2505
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:35,820
I should take more time to think about

2506
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:40,320
how to connect the the concept in rule

2507
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,960
with the existing terminologies or

2508
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,500
concept internet can I ask when you do

2509
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,679
that thinking can you after this meeting

2510
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:52,920
no no no no no not now but over over

2511
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:57,000
time if you find areas that you find

2512
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,219
difficult to to make that thinking

2513
01:42:59,219 --> 01:43:01,080
coherent and understandable for yourself

2514
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:04,320
in the document please record the pieces

2515
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,540
and get them on the mailing list because

2516
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:10,380
a document that isn't as easy as

2517
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:13,739
possible given the technology to help

2518
01:43:13,739 --> 01:43:16,199
people do that thinking and get correct

2519
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:19,980
needs to be better so you are a perfect

2520
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:22,199
reviewer because you are trying to

2521
01:43:22,199 --> 01:43:25,080
understand it for a reason rather than

2522
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:28,199
just for interest so okay pretty helpful

2523
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:30,900
thank you I think I will try it and she

2524
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:33,179
saw many thanks for undone and True song

2525
01:43:33,179 --> 01:43:34,800
for the hard work on the young data

2526
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,679
model I know it's very hard to do right

2527
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,239
and

2528
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:41,340
thank you thank you also thank you for

2529
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,940
your work here

2530
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,440
just try to get it clear I think the

2531
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,199
Rick said this like Workshop discussion

2532
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:00,300
so just yeah keep asking

2533
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:03,119
uh not the more I listened the more I

2534
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:06,500
got confused sorry about that

2535
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:09,719
no no and now try to downplay but they

2536
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:11,760
try to just

2537
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,179
because uh I I do both work on the uh

2538
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:17,520
awareness and the Wireline especially

2539
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,560
here you're talking about like the past

2540
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,000
the track

2541
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,060
and then PSE here so for and also you

2542
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:26,460
mentioned for your awareness or I you I

2543
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,139
think you mentioned about something uh

2544
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:31,080
like some Wi-Fi switch over to 5G you

2545
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:34,020
and one moment you mentioned but I tried

2546
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:37,139
to uh map the 5G architecture through

2547
01:44:37,139 --> 01:44:39,540
the three GPB access and the non-3 GPU

2548
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,760
access including the Wi-Fi

2549
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,360
and so here your path let me make the

2550
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,280
clear is your path

2551
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,219
the the DNA the data network has beyond

2552
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:51,659
the n6

2553
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:54,119
it all it will pass

2554
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:57,540
uh including the the back hall path

2555
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:00,719
between the genome B and the UPF

2556
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:05,880
or if your path end to end from UE up

2557
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,219
through the uh through the back hole

2558
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:11,340
through the 5gc and then all the way

2559
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:13,739
beyond the n6 including DNN so just try

2560
01:45:13,739 --> 01:45:17,900
to get it clear thank you can you

2561
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,900
on Slide the one which shows the two use

2562
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:25,080
cases I want to be well

2563
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:28,199
no no we're close so go down go down go

2564
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:29,040
down

2565
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:33,920
uh up I think it's no oops

2566
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,900
I think that's the one

2567
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,580
um

2568
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,320
okay

2569
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,600
so what you see here

2570
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,440
is

2571
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:47,820
probably the drawing that corresponds

2572
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:49,500
the best in the document to to the

2573
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,540
situation we we are talking about so the

2574
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:52,980
situation we're talking about is we

2575
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,960
don't have an end-to-end service we

2576
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,560
don't have end-to-end visibility on the

2577
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,960
path the only thing we see is what we

2578
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,639
see at layer 2 and what we see at layer

2579
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:03,840
3.

2580
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,400
and

2581
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,560
in the case of 5G because now you're

2582
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,760
modeling

2583
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:11,780
the 5G Network as a

2584
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:14,880
deterministic TSN type of network we

2585
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,619
could say that the debt net forwarding

2586
01:46:16,619 --> 01:46:17,760
extend

2587
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:20,040
to the

2588
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,260
G note B basically Unit B whatever it is

2589
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:25,980
so so this this relay node would be the

2590
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:29,400
end of TSN quote-unquote the the the we

2591
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,540
the 5G Network

2592
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,760
Pascal can you come back to the mic and

2593
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,940
see what I think was amazing yeah uh the

2594
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,340
little red one so

2595
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,320
the point I was making with the two use

2596
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:45,659
cases is this is part of the use case a

2597
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:47,940
where we only protect the access we

2598
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:50,040
don't know how you build the network

2599
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,739
behind it and even TSN doesn't see it

2600
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,199
because TSN

2601
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:57,110
um at least talks to to to

2602
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:58,260
[Music]

2603
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,840
your whole 5G Network as one switch but

2604
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,219
we don't see what's what's inside we

2605
01:47:02,219 --> 01:47:04,260
don't have visibility so the bottom line

2606
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:08,159
is we have layer three

2607
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,860
oam so we can observe when we send

2608
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:13,800
something whether it's received but we

2609
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,239
don't know what's going on here because

2610
01:47:15,239 --> 01:47:16,980
it's completely opaque

2611
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,080
is the internet it can be anything

2612
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:22,080
and so we we cannot take actions that

2613
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:25,139
happen here like inside your core we

2614
01:47:25,139 --> 01:47:27,480
don't see it the only thing we see is

2615
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,100
when we send a packet

2616
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,560
uh we send away um packets over this

2617
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,540
interface whether they are received or

2618
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:36,420
not so cdoam activity in my phone as

2619
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,460
being oh I've got those two or three

2620
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,860
interface and my phone one can be 3gpp

2621
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:42,420
that can be one or two Wi-Fi that can be

2622
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:44,040
Bluetooth whatever I'll get those

2623
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,320
interfaces and I'm sending away in

2624
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,679
packets on all of those out of band

2625
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,300
oh I am packet and all of those

2626
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:54,179
interfaces and I'm trying to measure if

2627
01:47:54,179 --> 01:47:56,580
some of them reach my server reach the

2628
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,920
other hand and based on that I can make

2629
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,440
decision of whether I'm using 5G Wi-Fi

2630
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,659
or whatever else from the abstraction

2631
01:48:03,659 --> 01:48:05,520
that we live on we don't even care what

2632
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,739
type of radio that is it's just access a

2633
01:48:07,739 --> 01:48:10,560
accessb access C and if I send a packet

2634
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,320
on an xsa xsb access C I'm getting this

2635
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,780
sort of reliability should I use two of

2636
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,000
them which two should I use three that's

2637
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,699
what the PSC will decide that's all it

2638
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:23,820
will do it doesn't have any control

2639
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:26,100
visibility of the type of radio or

2640
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,219
anything

2641
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,600
so sorry can you take it to the

2642
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,880
microphone yeah no it's so when we know

2643
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,860
the track is the other use case where

2644
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:37,619
it's a mesh okay so Sim to me you try to

2645
01:48:37,619 --> 01:48:41,940
make the 5G system as a black box yeah

2646
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:43,800
you do not care about the back card

2647
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,560
without running on the IP yes we we see

2648
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:49,560
end-to-end IP and one hop radio like the

2649
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,040
if my 5G goes down that I know but but

2650
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,860
the the rest I have no visibility on it

2651
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:58,860
so I I don't ask I don't act on it yeah

2652
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:00,480
so all this discussion is kind of photo

2653
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,920
scope of the are you asking

2654
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,560
chair hat on

2655
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:10,199
later once we get the architecture and

2656
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:12,840
these core documents done

2657
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,480
having uh there are linked layer

2658
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:18,060
protocols for for some types of radio

2659
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:21,719
having an ability to understand better

2660
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:23,820
to get better oam

2661
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:27,119
from those lower black boxes so to make

2662
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:30,480
them gray boxes in some way that would

2663
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,639
be very interesting and can make can

2664
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,520
provide more information on the OEM

2665
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,219
flow so that we can make smarter

2666
01:49:38,219 --> 01:49:40,560
decisions that's a good thing so they

2667
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:44,040
they don't have to be black but in

2668
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,719
general you have to assume they are

2669
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:48,480
black boxes until we can find some way

2670
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,540
to get information out up first and then

2671
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:54,600
maybe later down but that's a part two

2672
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,520
part three of the problem sure thank you

2673
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,619
Rick and now you know the more dileep

2674
01:49:58,619 --> 01:50:00,960
type of stuff we get the the best our

2675
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:04,139
life yeah we're genuinely trying to do

2676
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:06,179
step one then step two then step three

2677
01:50:06,179 --> 01:50:08,420
is

2678
01:50:09,139 --> 01:50:13,500
completely politics

2679
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:14,940
so

2680
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,739
yeah

2681
01:50:16,739 --> 01:50:20,659
thank you uh Lou you're up

2682
01:50:31,139 --> 01:50:32,639
the queue is too long I forgot what I

2683
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,420
was gonna say sorry

2684
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,960
in which case done

2685
01:50:40,739 --> 01:50:43,560
well we still have 10 minutes yeah

2686
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,060
um when you met when you were talking

2687
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:48,480
about the PSC uh did I hear you say that

2688
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:52,080
the PSE is deciding like locally to

2689
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,659
optimize for for each

2690
01:50:54,659 --> 01:50:57,119
uh service is that is that what it's

2691
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,520
doing yes it is it is

2692
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,320
switching which service is being used

2693
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,800
for that for that so and what makes that

2694
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,560
stable when everybody's trying to decide

2695
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,020
optimally for themselves like what what

2696
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:13,020
coordination function makes that stable

2697
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:16,139
okay so in in the current model there is

2698
01:51:16,139 --> 01:51:17,940
only one place where that this decision

2699
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,639
is made it's the Ingress

2700
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:22,260
but it's every service making its

2701
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:25,699
decision for itself right

2702
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:29,219
Oh you mean I have multiple services

2703
01:51:29,219 --> 01:51:31,560
that are running parallel that's what

2704
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,420
you well they're all over the network

2705
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:36,960
right because we uh all over the

2706
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,699
networks are nested so you don't they

2707
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:41,280
will all depend on what's going on below

2708
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,420
um yeah

2709
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:45,060
so so the the the intelligence behind

2710
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:47,699
all this is the pce

2711
01:51:47,699 --> 01:51:50,280
um but if you do this recursively

2712
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:54,060
I mean each each of the nested levels

2713
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:56,400
will have to offer an abstract

2714
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,080
reliability level between Ingress and

2715
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,360
egress and if that's used as one hub for

2716
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,340
the uh

2717
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,920
inner flow well

2718
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,600
the goal the goal is basically this

2719
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,760
right you've got in and out

2720
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:11,639
and for one end you want 2.5 out

2721
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:14,219
something like that just to ensure that

2722
01:52:14,219 --> 01:52:16,440
your loss is 10 minus five or ten minus

2723
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:19,139
whatever so you you should average

2724
01:52:19,139 --> 01:52:21,179
to the drive it's just the number I'm

2725
01:52:21,179 --> 01:52:24,119
giving now you should say a I'm going to

2726
01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:25,920
do compound flow and between here and

2727
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,900
here I have yet another track

2728
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:30,000
well this other track will be abstracted

2729
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,219
as something which gives me 2.5 and one

2730
01:52:32,219 --> 01:52:33,960
so that's a PC doing this right it would

2731
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:36,179
build this new inner track get to 2.5

2732
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:38,520
out of it and compute that this is a

2733
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,679
virtual link now that has 2.5 and make

2734
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:43,260
the bigger end-to-end service for the

2735
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:46,380
for the inner flow using that 2.5 link

2736
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,900
that's that's how I visualize it

2737
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:51,540
when you say 2.5 that's like an average

2738
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:54,080
five copies of the packet which yeah

2739
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,639
but there are multiple things that are

2740
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:00,480
trying to arrive at their whatever their

2741
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,960
optimal number is independently yeah

2742
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:08,480
yeah I I mean that that can be a problem

2743
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,980
the PC is supposed to orchestrate all

2744
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,780
this if it has more than one service

2745
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,820
right

2746
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:16,739
directions that could be a meta uh you

2747
01:53:16,739 --> 01:53:18,540
can see playing with all the plcs well

2748
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:20,040
then they're not independent there's

2749
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,139
hysteresis and there's a global

2750
01:53:22,139 --> 01:53:24,060
coordination then right

2751
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,699
I I did not visualize it with multiple

2752
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:29,699
services like this it's just blue is a

2753
01:53:29,699 --> 01:53:31,440
set of things but then you select blue

2754
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,600
as a whole I did not sell I don't think

2755
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,100
you would select some some little bit of

2756
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,080
blue and some little bit of yellow I

2757
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:38,520
thought that blue would be a consistent

2758
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:41,460
set of activities and and that you know

2759
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:43,139
it's not like you have multiple of them

2760
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:45,179
which operate independently it's just a

2761
01:53:45,179 --> 01:53:47,880
set it's the parameters the parameters

2762
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:50,280
of your pre-off in that node is is in

2763
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:51,659
blue and there is another set of

2764
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:53,820
parameters of that node that is red but

2765
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:56,340
I did not expect that would be

2766
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:58,320
parallel sets doing different things

2767
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,940
which are talking to one another it

2768
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:01,500
could get crazy

2769
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,880
I think if you were going to do that

2770
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,980
you'd use the layered service model and

2771
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:06,960
to either put that as a leveler or a

2772
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,960
layer above to do that multiplexed stuff

2773
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:13,460
um I I agree I agree with you get crazy

2774
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:15,900
I never figured you could run two things

2775
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,280
in parallel on the same packet without

2776
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,719
knowing what you're doing on each side

2777
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:21,360
that looks crazy to me even if we don't

2778
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,739
switch services

2779
01:54:22,739 --> 01:54:24,420
but

2780
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,760
okay because if they all have if you

2781
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,199
can't do two control loop on the same

2782
01:54:28,199 --> 01:54:29,580
physical system

2783
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,560
right I mean even in the real world if

2784
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:33,119
you have something that decides if your

2785
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:34,739
rating system goes up and down another

2786
01:54:34,739 --> 01:54:36,659
thing that makes another decision for

2787
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:38,040
the same meeting system you have a

2788
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,139
problem no no but even even if you just

2789
01:54:40,139 --> 01:54:42,179
have parallel ones each with their own

2790
01:54:42,179 --> 01:54:43,980
PSE

2791
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:46,380
they're going to compete on two

2792
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,420
different flows right nothing yeah on

2793
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:49,560
two different oh so you mean physical

2794
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,480
resources somewhere in the network yes

2795
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,580
okay okay that that's that's

2796
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:55,980
classical.net you must ensure that the

2797
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,360
physical resources are available to your

2798
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,619
flows

2799
01:54:58,619 --> 01:55:01,139
so I've locked the queue because we have

2800
01:55:01,139 --> 01:55:04,380
six minutes left uh Lou you have just

2801
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:06,420
squeezed in can you keep it short please

2802
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:08,040
just uh

2803
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,020
yeah this is a question to the chairs

2804
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:12,840
can we ask to get a sense of the room of

2805
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:15,179
whether or not we want to

2806
01:55:15,179 --> 01:55:18,420
um want uh going back to what Stu was

2807
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:21,360
saying do we want to focus on new

2808
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:24,900
terminology that may be more precise or

2809
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:29,340
to try to leverage existing terminology

2810
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:31,860
um and then refine that

2811
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:33,540
and if I may

2812
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:35,340
tweak the question a little bit remember

2813
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:37,980
that on the table there is the the third

2814
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:41,460
in between thing where

2815
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:44,460
more of the existing terminology as will

2816
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:47,219
be anyway injected in document

2817
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:49,679
for everything which is a thumbs up

2818
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,659
truck will go away basically it's going

2819
01:55:51,659 --> 01:55:54,480
to become anyway a path

2820
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,400
the question is for the big track itself

2821
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,100
right for the rest you want

2822
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:01,460
already

2823
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,719
so yes that's a good suggestion I'm just

2824
01:56:03,719 --> 01:56:05,400
trying to work out some way of asking

2825
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,560
that question using the show of hands

2826
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,199
tool I'm clear I'm clear that I asked it

2827
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:11,780
very badly so

2828
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:13,739
I couldn't come up with anything better

2829
01:56:13,739 --> 01:56:16,020
off the top of my head while you were

2830
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:16,679
um

2831
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:18,960
so I would like to point out that this

2832
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,320
week I've seen um

2833
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,060
various things that went poorly because

2834
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:25,739
the show of hands tool is a blunt

2835
01:56:25,739 --> 01:56:27,540
instrument unless you think it through

2836
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:29,760
beforehand you end up getting bad data

2837
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,080
out of it yeah

2838
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:34,380
and really we want to censor the room

2839
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:37,560
um does anybody object

2840
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:39,000
to the

2841
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,239
to what I think my understanding of the

2842
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:45,600
room is I think I heard

2843
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:49,679
strong consensus that people wanted a

2844
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:53,420
terminology section which unified

2845
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:56,520
familiar topics for people from the two

2846
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,980
re the two main inputs from the wireless

2847
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:01,739
world and from the debt net world

2848
01:57:01,739 --> 01:57:05,520
and added some richness to say in this

2849
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,860
document when we talk about this thing

2850
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:11,040
and I liked Stu's words here we mean

2851
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,960
something like this something like that

2852
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,760
from the other world with some

2853
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:16,320
qualifiers

2854
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,960
and getting that in early you know

2855
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,719
section three in that document just to

2856
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:23,820
Aid the reader does anyone think that is

2857
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:27,440
a fundamentally bad idea

2858
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:31,500
I I thought that might that one is a

2859
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:35,580
consensus so my following question is

2860
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:38,040
given Pascal is not a native English

2861
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,780
speaker

2862
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:43,080
and this is very much about and I'm

2863
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,000
going to say us English because British

2864
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,800
English doesn't help sometimes

2865
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,099
is there a is there is there a U.S

2866
01:57:50,099 --> 01:57:53,340
English speaker who would like to

2867
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:55,860
contribute text to this and I'm not

2868
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,380
saying that people where there are great

2869
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:00,179
people who speak English with a second

2870
01:58:00,179 --> 01:58:01,380
language and so I'm not going to

2871
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,260
discount them but given we are spending

2872
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:06,719
a lot of effort on the news and I'm

2873
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:09,420
using a French word for of of this

2874
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,400
terminology

2875
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:14,639
I think we need help on this is anyone

2876
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:18,060
willing to step forwards and do this

2877
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:20,699
I see Don FedEx hand I'm saying that for

2878
01:58:20,699 --> 01:58:23,059
the record

2879
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:31,679
uh yes and I I will absolutely underline

2880
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:33,300
that point you're correct you are

2881
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,659
correct

2882
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,480
that was two cards saying he'd be

2883
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,880
thrilled to review and help tweak but

2884
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:48,060
he's he's the wrong man to draft

2885
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:51,719
right uh thank you Pascal you can

2886
01:58:51,719 --> 01:58:55,260
oh and balash as well has has uh raised

2887
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:57,420
his hands which is a fantastic great

2888
01:58:57,420 --> 01:58:59,099
thank you Pascal do you want to add any

2889
01:58:59,099 --> 01:59:01,440
last points otherwise I I just have one

2890
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,239
last point is because you said something

2891
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:05,280
at some point though I did not want to

2892
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,260
interrupt the discussion on that but he

2893
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,820
traced

2894
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:10,560
the image that people might

2895
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,179
misunderstand something

2896
01:59:12,179 --> 01:59:14,760
and that's something is some Protocols

2897
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,380
are based on sessions there is one

2898
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:18,000
endpoint which does something the other

2899
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,619
end points that has to be aware of it

2900
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:23,119
and that's you know the matching thing

2901
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:27,440
the pre-off doesn't work like that

2902
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:31,020
for instance you might have one

2903
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:33,060
replication point that makes two copy

2904
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:34,320
and later on the right that may be

2905
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,060
another replication point that makes two

2906
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:37,020
copies

2907
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:38,580
somewhere in the end there will be a

2908
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:40,020
single elimination point which will

2909
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:41,880
eliminate all the copies that single

2910
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:43,560
elimination point doesn't talk to either

2911
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:45,960
of the other two

2912
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,900
they are independent and it doesn't care

2913
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:49,800
whether

2914
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:51,900
those replication nodes succeeded there

2915
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:53,219
is no session

2916
01:59:53,219 --> 01:59:55,260
so at some point there was this image

2917
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:57,840
like oh if I make a decision on my hand

2918
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,760
I have to tell somebody on the other

2919
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:01,619
hand of the network because that impacts

2920
02:00:01,619 --> 02:00:04,020
him no they must be independent

2921
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:05,639
because there is no time to talk to him

2922
02:00:05,639 --> 02:00:07,920
anyway whatever we do he needs to absorb

2923
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:10,320
we can never negotiate

2924
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,900
and and to design different the design

2925
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:14,699
is is distributed the operations can

2926
02:00:14,699 --> 02:00:16,980
happen anywhere and the nodes which

2927
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:19,860
absorb the copies don't have to know who

2928
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:22,440
made those copies perfect thank you

2929
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:25,199
Pascal so uh we are very very close on

2930
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:26,400
time

2931
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:28,380
um first I want to apologize for the

2932
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:29,820
fact that we missed the two-minute

2933
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:31,560
silence because we were too excitedly

2934
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:32,880
talking about things I can only

2935
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,500
apologize to those who wanted to hold

2936
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:36,599
that I'm so sorry

2937
02:00:36,599 --> 02:00:37,500
um

2938
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,599
any other business does anyone have

2939
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:42,599
anything that they wished they had

2940
02:00:42,599 --> 02:00:45,239
um talked about not concerning the raw

2941
02:00:45,239 --> 02:00:48,019
architecture draft

2942
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:53,099
so well there's our there's our silence

2943
02:00:53,099 --> 02:00:55,199
um in which case it really even I say

2944
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:56,940
thank you very much that was a

2945
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:59,820
productive conversation a good Workshop

02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,020
forwards

2948
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:05,880

2950
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:10,679
the list so we can just get on and get

2951
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:12,599
this raw draft of this raw architecture

2952
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:16,860
done because I'm very sick of it I'd

2953
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:19,320
also like to thank those of us who've

2954
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:21,780
been heads down on the the note taking

2955
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:24,420
because it was a really Dynamic and

2956
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:27,659
nuanced discussion we will no doubt have

2957
02:01:27,659 --> 02:01:30,560
