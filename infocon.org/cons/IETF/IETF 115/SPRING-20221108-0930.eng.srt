I can run this night because I've

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,580
already started go ahead

9
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,360
you know

10
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,400
okay good morning everyone or good

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,119
afternoon you're in Spring rocking Rupa

12
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,580
uh we're a full station today so we're

13
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,920
going to start now

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,720
remember that the session is being

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,540
recorded on including a video if you are

16
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,960
in the room

17
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,439
this is the is he not well you need to

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,960
read it if you haven't read it

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,979
especially if you are contributed

20
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,979
foreign

21
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,820
for ITF uh 115

22
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,700
so if you are in-person participant

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,340
you need to to sign in using mythical

24
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,580
multicolite this is being used as blue

25
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,660
sheet

26
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,360
and also this thing is being used to uh

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,980
to queue on the bike

28
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,280
so you have to enable queue on

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,319
meticulite before going to the mic

30
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,900
so that we can under a single queue for

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,319
both Olo code and remote attendees

32
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,360
uh but obviously keep your audio and

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,500
video off

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,400
if you are not using the light version

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
I saw something very important

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,560
um everyone need to wear a mask anytime

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,739
except if you are actively drinking

38
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,160
eating or speaking at the mic

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,739
this is uh very important this is going

40
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:47,940
to be checked

41
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,340
including during the meeting so please

42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,459
uh please make sure you have a mask

43
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,220
if you're a remote make sure your audio

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,440
and video are off unless you are

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,239
actually presenting

46
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,060
on the usually your headset is a is a

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,319
better audio quality

48
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,400
in terms of minutes we're going to use a

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,379
collaborative tools which is available

50
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,840
at the following URL

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,300
uh you're welcome to help to take notes

52
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,819
at least please check and correct your

53
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,159
name and comments you can do so

54
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,860
IHF is moving to a new Wiki system

55
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,780
so spring working up has moved to the

56
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,599
new Wiki it's available at the following

57
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,640
URL

58
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,220
the week has been slightly reorganized

59
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,739
uh it has also been updated so thank you

60
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,319
for being about that uh you're welcome

61
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
to to check uh whether the content is uh

62
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
correct during the migration

63
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,120
especially you can check whether your

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,519
request for last call or adoption code

65
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,620
is still there and still correct

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,260
okay so since July uh we have adopted a

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,540
new policy in the working group

68
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,780
so we now among data an implementation

69
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,400
section in the draft

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,320
at least before working up last caller

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,019
this section is based on

72
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,660
the b205

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,460
which is about improving awareness of

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,660
running code

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,780
with implementation status section

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,139
we're a bit more specific items we

77
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,840
request all items either identified in

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,940
section 2 of the BCP

79
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,280
to be a to be filled

80
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,520
you can put not known it's fine but just

81
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,080
to check that uh

82
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,100
is not lost it's not blocking for

83
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,919
progressing to ASG but we do request the

84
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,360
best effort

85
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,060
so you can feel non-reporter does not

86
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,500
apply but something needs to be written

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,060
we also

88
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,960
um

89
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,660
ask for a statement that the

90
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,300
implementation

91
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,240
um is compliant with all mercen should

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,540
in the specification and if not which

93
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,160
one are not followed

94
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,979
on as per PCP 205 the section will be

95
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,639
removed before RC publication

96
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
so you can check the full policy on the

97
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
wiki

98
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,020
but it's just a reminder it has been

99
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,099
discussed on the list

100
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,300
in terms of a document

101
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,759
so my mistake in the slide the working

102
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,740
group Plus Code has not been started

103
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,080
actually we started but we

104
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
we stopped it because the implementation

105
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,340
section wasn't there

106
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,800
but we are about to start again the

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,479
working plus code on SR education

108
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,919
segments

109
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,960
so please review and comment it's

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,720
important for specification to be uh to

111
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,220
be supported by the group and to be

112
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,280
reviewed from a technical standpoint

113
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,160
so it's very important

114
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,600
otherwise the graph will not progress

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,639
in terms of classical we have an ITF

116
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,160
last call just started on a MPS pass

117
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,580
segment

118
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,500
with nsh integration with um with

119
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,160
segment protein

120
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,560
so that's all for document status this

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,539
is the agenda for today we have a full

122
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,979
agenda

123
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,860
so please stick to your allocated time

124
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,380
which include time to present on time to

125
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,479
to discuss

126
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,180
is there any any comments or bashing on

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,539
the internet

128
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,620

so uh in agenda we have this being

149
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,340
presented in past tomorrow there is more

150
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,560
time allocated for this presentation in

151
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,479
past there will be good discussion on it

152
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,099
as well

153
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,500
um and we're just presenting uh in

154
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,059
spring because of some Sr mpls um

155
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,080
implications on it the scope is

156
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,080
we look at the scope the solution that's

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
presented in the draft uh some we have

158
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,060
reserved our codes uh there is some

159
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,500
ordering there's some good discussions

160
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,180
happening on the action ordering

161
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,160
backwards compatibility and the next

162
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,839
steps next slide please

163
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,080
so the scope of this draft is uh for the

164
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,160
mpls encoding Solution that's uh in the

165
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,459
label stack there is a another draft for

166
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,580
the Post stack highest draft so the both

167
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,720
of them together form the complete mne

168
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,420
solution and the scope is to meet them

169
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,060
in the requirements and uh framework

170
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,459
that's already adopted by the mpls a

171
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,880
working group next slide please

172
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
so there are two parts to the solution

173
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,220
one is the network action the sub stack

174
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,080
header and the second is the action

175
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,620
encoding the header is basically a bspl

176
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,660
label indicate indicating that there is

177
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,540
a substance there which is encoding

178
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,459
parameters like the scope the ordering

179
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,740
length and whatnot and the action is

180
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,620
basically a TLP so opcode length and the

181
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,480
ancillary data is the value next slide

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,459
please

183
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,399
so the header test mentioned there's a

184
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,580
bspl uh there is a length of the header

185
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,399
for the so a lot of work has been gone

186
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,940
in defining this encoding for easier

187
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,399
parsing especially in Asic so there is a

188
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,680
land uh that the scope is there if you

189
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,600
want to do on the end points or hop by

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,120
hop or on select nodes

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
um there is some discussion ordering

192
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,260
there's a beat this is it must be

193
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,480
executed or the order is specified or

194
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,660
it's an optional next slide please

195
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,339
and the second part is the X and

196
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,740
encoding part which is a tlv so you have

197
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,040
uh op code the data and the length of it

198
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,220
so it's uh not recognized using the land

199
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,459
it can be skipped uh there is a known

200
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,380
awkward handling uh so if you don't

201
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,779
recognize it uh there is a way to

202
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,540
specify either a Skip and go to the next

203
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,120
one based on the land or drop the packet

204
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,339
or just forget about M A and just

205
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,459
forward the packet so uh this is

206
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,560
basically uh if you can see this as a

207
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,459
toolkit and how application will use

208
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,260
this toolkit it will be up to the

209
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,200
applications uh so the the programming

210
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,500
aspects of it and all the parameters are

211
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,940
in the solution

212
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,880
next slide please

213
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,399
so uh for there is a substack per scope

214
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,640
uh so for the hubby Hopper selector a2n

215
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,700
uh scope uh there's a sub stack uh this

216
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,040
is uh defined to make the parsing and

217
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,560
processing easier on the midpoint nodes

218
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,459
next slide please

219
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,899
so we have reserved some of course uh uh

220
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,300
there are four or five of them first one

221
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,760
is uh to say where the offset is for the

222
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,579
Post Tech data so this is to allow the

223
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,420
uh the gsch kind of uh existing

224
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,880
um data or header to be carried another

225
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,040
one is an OP code to just if you just

226
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,079
want to carry the flag based accents

227
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,180
there is a third one is for the flag

228
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,579
based Excellence with data and then

229
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,700
there is a another one to carry uh the

230
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,740
post stack network access as well so

231
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,720
that was that's on the next slide um

232
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,100
yeah so we can skip this as well

233
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,980
yeah and there are two uh special uh of

234
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,260
course one is the upper 127 so it's a

235
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,480
seven bit of course in case we run out

236
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,060
of it unlikely but there is a way to

237
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,600
extend it and 126 is if there is no uh

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,640
aim stack action and there is only a

239
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,100
post-tech accents uh 126 is a reserved

240
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,480
for it next slide please

241
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,459
so there is some discussions about

242
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,800
ordering how it should be executed so

243
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,779
there's an OB Define if it's set then it

244
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,399
must be executed in the order that's

245
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,459
encoded if not then it's based on how

246
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,100
the application Define it there is some

247
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,839
discussions about what should be done in

248
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,500
stack or post stack uh so uh there are

249
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,839
some flag base so how that should be uh

250
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,180
uh executed as well so there are some

251
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,519
examples in the draft on what the

252
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,700
authors think can be done uh welcome

253
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,160
your comments on that next slide please

254
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,019
so this is about ordering between instac

255
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,540
and post stack as well so next slide

256
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,399
please

257
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,459
so there is a lot of uh brainstorming

258
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,560
and thinking went in to make sure the

259
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,079
solution is backwards compatible

260
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,399
especially if you're only going to do

261
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,220
the end-to-end processing uh or

262
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,160
end-to-end m a uh we don't want to

263
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,380
upgrade the penultimate node or midpoint

264
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,839
nodes it should be transparent to it

265
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,300
make sure the ecmp is not adverse

266
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,480
affected uh make sure that it doesn't

267
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,320
Alias when existing reserve bspl it can

268
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,800
coexist with gsh so a lot of the uh

269
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,500
thinking has gone in but there could be

270
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,200
something so if you have feedback on on

271
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
this aspects please let us know

272
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,800
and next slide please

273
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,339
we'll skip the advantages

274
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,019
so at this point I welcome your review

275
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,480
comments and feedbacks as mentioned this

276
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,540
is a converge uh unified solution among

277
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,920
all the authors

278
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,380
um uh we receive lots of good review

279
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,079
comments uh and we are addressing these

280
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,300
comments uh some cleanup is required

281
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,700
there's some discussions on the scope at

282
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,540
ordering um so on all the aspects that

283
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,600
we presented today uh let us know if you

284
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,940
have feedback comments

285
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,560
and that's all I had

286
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,740
uh Grand whiskey Erickson so you

287
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,800
mentioned that uh the offers paid uh

288
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,920
special attention to uh

289
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,660
end to end

290
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,800
uh operation of MMA so basically when uh

291
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,639
anime is expected to be operated only at

292
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,760
egress

293
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,459
uh but my understanding is that uh there

294
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,220
are other uh options there is a hubby

295
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,779
Hub and there is what's called select

296
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:26,639
um given uh it's currently indicated in

297
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,260
very high level

298
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,980
of encoding

299
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,360
uh do you see that uh different

300
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,420
modes can be combined

301
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,240
together for example so some functions

302
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
are like iom

303
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,300
being requested to do hubby Hub while

304
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,440
uh for example uh generic uh

305
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,320
Pro indicator

306
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,959
is clearly end to end

307
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,600
yes definitely so uh there is a sub

308
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,300
stack for hubby hop and that is a

309
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,360
substack for end-to-end only requirement

310
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,779
for backwards compatibility is that the

311
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,040
m a bspl if it's exposed or under

312
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,079
received packet at the no receiving it

313
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,899
and that does not understand the bspl it

314
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,000
may drop the packet

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
um so that's the only constraint for the

316
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,320
backwards compatibility so the Ingress

317
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
and cap node needs to make sure that

318
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,839
along the path is never received vspl is

319
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,880
not at the top on the received node that

320
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,380
you cannot understand

321
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,380
um well that was not really my question

322
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,620
uh let me rephrase so for example

323
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,120
imagine that uh because of uh maximum

324
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,600
stack that

325
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,699
along the path

326
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,800
um we can put

327
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,980
um Hub by heart and end to end at the

328
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,240
bottom of the stack

329
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,560
so

330
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,299
to do hard by hop and end to end Network

331
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,359
actions with the current encapsulation

332
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,720
do you see it's possible to do it on the

333
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,240
one special purpose label or that will

334
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,000
require two special purpose labels so

335
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,280
two Network action sub stacks so the the

336
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,520
one special purpose label we can have

337
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,940
multiple copies of the sub stack and we

338
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,520
can have copies with different scope so

339
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,620
you would have one sub stack with hop by

340
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,720
hopscope and another sub stack with I2

341
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,840
Esco and hubby Hops uh substack will

342
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,780
contain the iom and the second sub stack

343
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,480
with the same bspl will have the flow

344
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,600
identifier for I2 okay thank you

345
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,520
okay thank you any no that's uh many

346
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,419
thanks

347
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,020
thank you

348
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,000
and now we'll we'll move to um next

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,440
presentation

350
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,559
for interlayer Network programming

351
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,360
um presented being uh U1

352
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,020
is my voice okay

353
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,760
I can hear you I'm going to share your

354
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,299
slime yes

355
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,440
good morning everyone uh this chapter is

356
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,860
on the topic of slv6 foreign Network

357
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,440
programming and the authors are from

358
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,080
Huawei and China mobile next slide

359
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,500
please

360
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
uh first I will introduce the background

361
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
operator usually have a multi-layered

362
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,380
network the layer 3 is normally IP based

363
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,539
technology where different technology

364
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,799
could be used for the underlying layers

365
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,539
for example there are two another one

366
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,840
the closed layer Network programming and

367
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,080
the optimization is expected it is

368
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,360
considered more efficient compared with

369
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,840
the independent planning for each layer

370
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,539
but it's also considered more

371
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,720
complicated as the way 6 enabled Network

372
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,700
programming by encoding Network

373
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,179
instructions in IP Handler but currently

374
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,520
only the network instructions related to

375
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,740
ipd are defined

376
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,480
so we come to user srv6 for the network

377
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,400
layers under IP

378
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,940
so we think slv6 can be further extended

379
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,640
to achieve the same needs internal

380
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,520
Network integration between IP and the

381
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,740
under layer layers

382
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,559
so this document describes the use cases

383
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,500
for the internal Network programming and

384
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,340
we propose a new srv6 function for this

385
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,760
purpose next slide please

386
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,059
foreign

387
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,799
use cases for the inter-layer

388
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,020
programming these three scenarios are

389
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,120
very common and widely used in The

390
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,720
Operators Network first case is IP and

391
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,120
Optical Network integration

392
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
in many scenarios in the network the

393
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,760
underlay of IP network is the optical

394
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,600
network but in some cases Optical parts

395
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,820
and IP parts may not be one by one

396
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,820
mapping so the reduction to Optical

397
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,340
process may not be fully used by IP

398
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,400
layer secondly the optical process may

399
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,059
exist between adjacent to IP nodes so

400
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,320
it's not too reasonable in the layers

401
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,120
rate polity

402
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,360
the second case is the IP and MTN

403
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,580
integration the MTN is Metro transport

404
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Network it's a new technology and has

405
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,059
been divided in itog.8310

406
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,940
the m-team parts layer uses TDM

407
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,240
switching the intermediate nodes to

408
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,660
avoid Hub to hope I hope IP packet

409
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,360
display team so mq nodes can support

410
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,559
both per hope ip40 and it also supports

411
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,740
MTM Parts cross connect

412
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,140
the traffic can be carried using IP

413
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,600
parts and team parts or the combination

414
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,960
of the two but currently srv6 only can

415
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
be used for the IP pass programming for

416
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,539
the MTN Network the MTN Parts is not

417
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,919
included

418
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,039
the third use case is traffic steering

419
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,720
to a layer 2 random member link each

420
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,520
member link is a layer 2 connection

421
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,760
without layer 3 and this

422
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
um

423
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,840
and decency so if we want to choose one

424
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,600
specific Layer Two member link we need a

425
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,860
new function

426
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,970
next slide please

427
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,299
[Music]

428
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:17,280
also we propose a new slv6 which called

429
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,720
end XU in order to solve the inter-layer

430
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,140
program in the use cases this endpoint

431
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,480
with underlying

432
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,080
cross connect is a variance of the and X

433
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,539
Behavior it may propose it for the

434
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:34,980
interlayer programming and traffic

435
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,720
engineering uh the end actually is

436
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,000
associated with an underlay interface

437
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,460
which connects to one or more

438
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,179
underlyings or connections and the light

439
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:53,159
and 15 from the slv6 and progressing in

440
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,340
the current RFC

441
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,580
8986 is replaced by the following

442
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,320
forward the package through the

443
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,600
underlying interface associate with

444
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,280
seeds

445
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,658
next slide please

446
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,600
in this slide we give application

447
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,659
example to use the index using IP

448
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,720
Optical integration in this figure we

449
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
can see there is a IP networks only the

450
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,860
optical Network the node P1 to pH is IP

451
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,480
nodes and the node 01206 is Optical

452
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,780
nodes if we want to set up a package

453
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,140
transmission connection from p7 to the

454
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,500
right pH with normal segment routine

455
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,559
solution we can find the seedless in IP

456
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,900
network is p7 P1 P2 P3 p8

457
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,740
but assume there is Optical parts of 102

458
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,840
203 if there is taking the optical

459
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,059
Network we can use the NX usage to

460
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:02,220
P1 to steal traffic to this underlay

461
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,159
Parts under the optical parts so maybe

462
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,799
we can provide a lower literacy compared

463
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,620
with the normal IP parts

464
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,320
therefore the IP Optical interlayer path

465
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,080
can be created Created with a seedless

466
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,419
the new set listed p7 P1 and XU from O2

467
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:27,000
to O3 then go to the P3 pH

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,260
next slide please

469
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,980
we give another example in this slide

470
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,880
it's a application of NX during ipmq

471
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,059
integration uh we can see in the figure

472
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,580
in the figure the operator earns both

473
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,380
the MTN Network in the metro area and

474
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,400
also IP network in the backbone area but

475
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,919
for the empty nodes it builds two

476
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,880
separate Network layers the layer 3

477
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,159
function in the topology and the MTN

478
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,120
Parts topology

479
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,179
connect so we can use and X usage

480
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,600
to be allocated for each MTM parts

481
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,100
so we can correct a zip list with nxu to

482
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,380
end to end parts with layer 3 and I'm

483
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,960
two segments

484
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,200
in this solution we can flexible select

485
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,900
empty parts and layer 3 in all the

486
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,400
networks

487
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,020
next slide please

488
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,840
also inclusion we think the income layer

489
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,700
Network programming is a significant

490
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,640
requirements and stress to study and

491
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,760
divide the endpoint function for this

492
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,299
application and any comments and famous

493
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:58,799
feedbacks are welcome thank you very

494
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,600
much that's all

495
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,120
okay Sasha you're up first

496
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,020
hi uh I'm social Einstein from ribbon

497
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,799
can you please uh show again the the

498
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,460
slide with the no one uh one little bit

499
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,020
yes this one

500
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,380
uh I have a question

501
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,840
uh as explained

502
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,559
the optical path between P1 and P3 is

503
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,460
not an IP uh an iPad

504
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,700
my question is when P3 receives an IP

505
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,580
packet from

506
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:44,340
p7 I think uh how does it know uh which

507
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,100
layer two encapsulation should be pushed

508
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,640
on this packet before it is sent by the

509
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,840
optical path

510
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,260
because without this uh encapsulation P3

511
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,179
most probably wouldn't recognize the

512
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,700
packet as an IP packet and wouldn't be

513
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,100
able to forward it

514
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,379
via the IP pass to p8

515
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,380
[Music]

516
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,360
uh we normally we ate if the parts were

517
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,380
an IP interface P1 would try to resolve

518
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,120
uh

519
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,000
battery IP address or something like

520
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,480
that using our Pro uh Naval Discovery

521
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,140
but since the Optical path is not an

522
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,299
hyper pass such resolution seems

523
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,720
impossible

524
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,540
hurryan do you have any comment on that

525
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,599
[Music]

526
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,000
how well uh ran ran Chen you're next

527
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,440
yeah

528
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
okay uh

529
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,559
hi uh we agree with the useless

530
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,260
it's a lion Network programming at the

531
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,080
requirements and thank you very much for

532
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,860
your visitors to work and we also have

533
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,279
similar proposals uh by the way things

534
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,460
but new as always six and the bxc we

535
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,860
have here for interlier Network

536
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,419
programming

537
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,919
the srv6 and the pxc function mechanism

538
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,779
has been implemented by the key and the

539
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,659
China mobile has successfully completed

540
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,559
the basic verification of this function

541
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,320
hope it can catch you and the working

542
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,240
group attention thank you

543
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,459
thank you

544
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,940
Katan go ahead

545
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,400
go uh kind of follow on to snasha's

546
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,380
comment uh that

547
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,679
uh the whether the optical path is IP or

548
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,159
not is I think not clear uh but uh n dot

549
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,580
X said uh which is in RFC 8986 Network

550
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,899
programming

551
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,659
does can be used for layer to bundle

552
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,240
member states and therefore I mean I

553
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,460
don't see any reason why we need a new

554
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,000
uh Behavior it can be used for this

555
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,080
Optical link as well

556
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,500
for steering into Optical path

557
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,760
n dot X existing one

558
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,899
okay thank you ketan Chetan your turn

559
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:56,940
from Huawei and firstly I'd like to

560
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,539
respond to Sasha's comments on the

561
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,559
uh whether a P3 can correctly receive

562
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,840
the packet and forward it I think it is

563
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,899
a good question rather how to resolve

564
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,480
the like the IRP all the layer tool

565
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,620
information

566
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,960
uh since this draft currently does not

567
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,500
cover that details but perhaps we can

568
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,799
consider to uh

569
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,700
distribute some kind of information

570
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,820
through some control plane that is a

571
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,140
reply and the truth comes from Curtin

572
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,559
uh our understanding is uh the current

573
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,320
and Dot X behavior is very is correct

574
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,640
explicitly defined for the layer 3

575
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,740
adjacency and that kind of information

576
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,320
are used for the to build the leadership

577
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,020
topology and the forwarding pass in the

578
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,399
leadership network uh we Define this

579
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,380
node.xu to separate it from the

580
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,080
leadership apologies so that we for some

581
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
Network behaviors we don't want to mix

582
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,120
the literacy adjacency with the entirely

583
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,480
links so that we can have different fast

584
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,340
computation with four different kind of

585
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,260
service so this is the purpose to

586
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,200
distinguish these two food behaviors

587
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,740
okay

588
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,620
okay we'll move on to that

589
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,080
somebody was trying to say something I

590
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,740
couldn't tell who

591
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,820
okay we'll move on to the next

592
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,080
presentation thank you

593
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,380
hello can you hear me

594
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,399
yes we do

595
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,240
yes thank you uh I'm using Leo from

596
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,020
China mobile and today I will present

597
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,559
the encapsulation of BFD for The

598
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,659
Advocate policy

599
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,600
this is the first presentation of this

600
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,840
draft

601
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,000
next slide please

602
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,980
okay

603
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,440
we when we use the BFD session to

604
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,299
monitor the srs6 policy and as we know

605
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,419
uh sos6 policy has three levels and the

606
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,720
brt session runs associated with the

607
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
second list level and when we have

608
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,760
decision done the set the associated a

609
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,179
second list fail and the traffic will

610
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,240
stop forwarding and with this uh

611
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,539
specific segment list while all of the

612
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,299
signals the failed of the active

613
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,840
candidate parts and

614
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,700
the traffic will switch over to the

615
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,100
backup candidate pass and all of the

616
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,880
candid paths fail and the policy field

617
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,860
uh

618
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,899
why we uh the second is that uh uh what

619
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:14,519
the choice of the address for the BFD

620
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,220
and here we uh give the two types of the

621
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,260
BFD as DMV and the upfd ubfd means that

622
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,380
we use the bfpi code function and you

623
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,440
turn on the reflector and when we use

624
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,320
the spfd the head and address we can use

625
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,100
the iv6 address of the head end and the

626
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,799
and the two and the address we use the

627
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,000
endpoint of the SV rv6 policy or

628
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,159
specified by the local configuration

629
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,940
and for the ubft the head and adjust we

630
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,779
use the x36 address of the head and

631
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:56,820
we'll use the root ball or non-root ball

632
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,220
uh

633
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,140
for the tail end we must use the root

634
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,960
Pro ip6 address of the head end next

635
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,620
slide please

636
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,020
and uh we have the uh two modes of the

637
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,580
encapsulation of the BFD packet and the

638
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,760
uh the the difference between the the

639
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,139
SRH how to uh in Captivate the SRH and

640
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,418
uh for the track mode transport mode the

641
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,739
SRH is inserted after the ip6 header and

642
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,099
the tunnel mode we have the outer ip6

643
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:43,139
header with the SRH and the inner it's

644
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,219
uh for the BFD packet like the plan IPv6

645
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:52,679
pack package still into the srv6 policy

646
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,480
let's start sleep please

647
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,460
and next slides we uh I will uh

648
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,119
give the details of this uh

649
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,200
two modes for both the fbd and ubfd and

650
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,900
when the spit in chess mode transport

651
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,619
mode we are encapsulated only one IPv6

652
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,880
header and the SRH and for the sl0

653
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,480
position should be the athletic feed or

654
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,720
the ip6 address of the tail end node

655
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,820
but uh

656
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,000
sometimes the last segment of the second

657
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,260
list in the sr6 policy does not belong

658
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,500
to the tail end it can be a n dot X

659
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,040
segment of the parliament

660
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,540
Hub or a bunny seed so in such cases we

661
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,740
will add

662
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,180
a ip6 address or s36 seed of the tail

663
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,260
and node and the last segment will put

664
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,700
in the SL1 position in the SRH

665
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,020
and that's the slide please

666
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,820
when the sap internal mode we are

667
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,660
encapsulated the inner IPv6

668
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,440
header with the

669
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,160
ability packet and the author with the

670
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,119
IPv6 header with the SRH and

671
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,520
at the same

672
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,920
so

673
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,920
zero position should be the s36 seed or

674
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,859
the ip6 address of the tail and node

675
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,180
and

676
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,359
if the last segment of the second

677
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:46,020
listing sr6 policy does not belong the

678
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,940
tail end and maybe a n dot X but did

679
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,940
this I know that without the USD flavor

680
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,280
if if he he has if it has a USD flavor

681
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,720
it can decapitulate one in at the

682
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,700
punishment hub

683
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,740
so if we

684
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,900
that have the USD flavor or it's in it

685
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,480
is a burning feeder we should add ipv 6

686
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,780
address or a seed of the tail end load

687
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,140
in the sl0 position and put the last

688
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,680
segment of the segmentalist in sr6

689
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,400
policy in the SL1 position

690
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,660
so that's the slide please

691
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,500
the next is two slides about the ubfd

692
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,440
when the ubfd in transport mode that it

693
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,900
is uh that is a simple thing and only

694
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,480
one optimistic header is used to

695
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,599
encapsulate the echo packet

696
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,140
and for the SL

697
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,200
zero partition we use the SRA 6 seed or

698
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,619
the ip6 suggests of the head end and the

699
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,540
one the echo package arrived the tail

700
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,260
end

701
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,760
it it will use the destination address

702
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,500
at the SL 0 petition that is the head

703
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,460
and node address

704
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,540
uh one the usbsp in the tunnel mode we

705
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,060
encapsulate the inner Acoustics header

706
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,300
and the outer s36

707
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,460
encapsulation and

708
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,859
the destination of the inner

709
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:47,460
fps6 is the address of the head and the

710
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,960
node and the the

711
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,579
Outer Outer ip6 header we use the SL

712
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:59,160
zero partition should be the isab is six

713
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,619
seed or the IPv6 address of the tail end

714
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,160
and that is the same scenario that if

715
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,279
the last segment of the srv6 policy

716
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,260
without the USD flavor or upon your seat

717
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,460
it we we will add the fb6 address or

718
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,619
seed of the tail and in the SL steel

719
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,839
zero partition

720
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,420
so next slide please

721
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,020
so that's all thank you uh welcome for

722
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,540
the questions and comments

723
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,800
okay Greg

724
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,820
um Greg nurse Erickson

725
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,280
um a couple questions but um probably

726
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,839
there

727
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,160
uh first question is uh what's special

728
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,900
on encapsulation

729
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,440
so special for DFD

730
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,500
because I think that you explain uh

731
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,619
different modes of a certain

732
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,140
encapsulation in the SAR modes

733
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,560
but I don't see that it's different from

734
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,640
encapsulating payload uh and services

735
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,579
that to be monitored using uh BFD and I

736
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,119
I cannot find anything that is specific

737
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,460
to BFD being used over this a service 6

738
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,060
modes

739
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,220
we just work on the how to encapsulate

740
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,460
uh the BFD packet in the atheristics

741
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,260
policy and it may be uh have a major

742
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,260
difference from uh for the normal date

743
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,660
package

744
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:06,180
but if you uh okay if you suggest that

745
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,119
DFD should be encapsulated differently

746
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,380
from the payload then how you guarantee

747
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,859
that PFD will follow the same path and

748
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:20,579
will be treated the same as a uh service

749
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:24,020
that you're trying to monitor

750
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,280
uh I see that there is some

751
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,800
contradiction so you believe uh that BFD

752
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,500
has to be encapsulated differently into

753
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,339
a service six policy uh compared to

754
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,500
their payload

755
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,079
but then the question is if that's the

756
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,200
case then what are you monitoring

757
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,839
because if you encapsulate differently

758
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,400
on a service six level then uh the

759
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,700
packets would not follow the same path

760
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,859
okay I think this probably needs to go

761
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,980
to the list right a little short time

762
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,599
I mean I think Greg you've got a good

763
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,980
question but we need to take it to the

764
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,119
list Trotta you're next

765
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,240
yes go ahead

766
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,119
yeah so another question that you want

767
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,220
to know if it's not clear why you're

768
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,960
defining two different modes like

769
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,119
transport modern tunnel mode

770
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,760
it seems like all the scenarios can be

771
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,740
satisfied with just one word for example

772
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,260
transport more and it can detect the

773
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,900
liveness of the segment list

774
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,420
uh so can you explain why you define two

775
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,079
different modes

776
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,320
uh so I cut here very clearly

777
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,480
okay I will post my question on the chat

778
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,940
thank you

779
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,540
thank you

780
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,800
hi can you hear me

781
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,940
go ahead

782
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,980
yes can you hear me

783
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,319
yes

784
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,740
I yes my question is

785
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,280
um

786
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,380
the the uh why can't uh the sspfd

787
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,440
packets can take the uh use the standard

788
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,079
srv6 programming or is there anything

789
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,119
special that's being done in this graph

790
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,720
other than using the standard srv6

791
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,000
programming

792
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,619
uh we we just use the the standard sl6

793
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:42,660
programming we do the uh change anything

794
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,960
of debt

795
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,920
okay so what what is uh what would be

796
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,020
the benefit I guess of this graph what

797
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,540
is this graph adding outside of srv6

798
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,099
programming

799
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,960
um that's uh

800
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,940
that would need to be standardized I

801
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,099
guess good special outside of normal

802
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,920
behavior of a packet I guess it's being

803
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,119
um

804
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,700
either to be monitored from the ahead

805
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,020
and you know to the tail end

806
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,339
um

807
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,040
okay Jeff go ahead

808
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,900
Jeff Hardy speaking is with the bft

809
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,300
chair

810
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,040
uh your presentation was clear thank you

811
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,200
this comment is primarily addressed to

812
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,599
the spring chairs

813
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,640
we're currently tracking five distinct

814
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,060
documents for BFD out of spring one is

815
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,520
adopted four have not been

816
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,800
the documents are substantially the same

817
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,720
in many respects this is part of what's

818
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,480
been commented on in the last several

819
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,900
speakers

820
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,280
my suggestion would be to the working

821
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,859
group that rather than having five

822
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,560
distinct documents since you know

823
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,540
majority of this stuff is overlapping

824
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,119
Technologies with specific examples for

825
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,480
specific technology that's our v6s or V6

826
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,700
tunneling

827
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,740
please consider taking one of the

828
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,780
documents and simply having an

829
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,060
individual encapsulation example for

830
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,859
each of them since the procedures are

831
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:15,359
largely the same

832
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,280
this will probably save yourselves a lot

833
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,560
of grief and when things come around to

834
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,359
being reviewed by BFD you know for your

835
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,119
last call Process we'll simplify things

836
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,220
I can certainly understand why you'd

837
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,260
prefer not to have to review five and

838
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,540
we'd certainly prefer to see the various

839
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,880
authors pull together so that there's

840
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,700
one set of review in Spring as well

841
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,540
thank you Jeff

842
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,900
so next is a segment routine based

843
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,119
solution for hierarchical igf Network

844
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,560
slices

845
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,560
lion

846
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:17,220
hello everyone this is Liang from

847
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,020
Channel mobile

848
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,859
I'm going to talk about the topic of

849
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,980
segment routine that's the solution for

850
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,339
hierarchical ITF Network license

851
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:33,020
uh on behalf of all the co-authors

852
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,599
this draft has been completed in this

853
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,740
disability on 114 meeting

854
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,540
and is the suggested to presenter to

855
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,700
Spring also

856
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,300
because the solution is based on the

857
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,000
segment routine

858
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,780
so we also look forward to 12 months and

859
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,079
want to get your opinions on whether it

860
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,420
can be moved forward

861
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,520
so next place

862
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,560
for the concept of the hierarchical item

863
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,240
networks like this is based on the itfl

864
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,980
terminologies

865
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,720
Network slicing iqf Network slides and

866
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,920
the network resource partition

867
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,960
the hierarchical HF Network slices

868
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,359
described the networks like this which

869
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:39,900
can be further sliced or convent

870
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,760
hierarchically

871
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,819
uh for example one of the possible

872
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:48,859
scenarios is that an industry slides

873
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:52,500
needs to be divided into multi-customers

874
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,119
like this

875
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,500
so generally the idea of the draft is to

876
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,680
propose a true level hierarchical item

877
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,160
networks like this solution based on the

878
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,339
statement routine level one network

879
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,040
slides

880
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,119
is associated with the flexed alcohol

881
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:18,359
with the dedicated sub interfaces and

882
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:22,500
the level 2 Network slides is realized

883
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,099
by using the as a policy with additional

884
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,800
nappy ID on data plane

885
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,300
uh next place

886
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,220
and this slide shows the topology and

887
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,220
the traffic folding of the true level

888
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,560
hierarchical slices

889
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,060
it's a level one is associated with a

890
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,839
flex alcohol and the traffic is still

891
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,400
into the flex elbow passes

892
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,579
using the prefixed seeds or as a value

893
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:03,240
located a statistics locators

894
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,200
and the level 2 Network slides is

895
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,460
associated with one of a group of as a

896
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,900
policies under the level 1 NRP and the

897
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,060
traffic is geared into the SR policies

898
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,960
next please

899
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,680
uh the network resources is also

900
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,160
partitioned in a hierarchical manner

901
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,319
kicking bandwidth resources as an

902
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:38,180
example

903
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,060
the level one and wise is guaranteed by

904
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,880
a little series sub interface with

905
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,680
dedicated bandwidth and the prefix state

906
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,720
or srv6 locators is used as a datably

907
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,560
identifier

908
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,300
um the level 2 bandwidth is guaranteed

909
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,020
by kills with dedicated bandwidths under

910
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,800
the little three step interface and the

911
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,420
NRP ID is used as the data plan

912
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,260
identifier

913
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,859
next please

914
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,140
about the relationship between the NRP

915
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,859
and the slides actually

916
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,700
each NRP either level one or level 2

917
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,619
boost can be used to support one or a

918
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,160
group of network slides so it is

919
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,140
compliant with the ITF definition

920
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:50,220
but here for the example when we

921
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,680
actually

922
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,359
deployment theater it's much more

923
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:58,380
complicated for low to NRP to be mapped

924
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,680
to multi slices

925
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,520
so in actors in ISO and we think it

926
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,240
makes little sense is the resource is

927
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,800
already finally divided as

928
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,859
previously described so here for the

929
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:19,859
example the level 2 NRP to slice is

930
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:23,180
shown as one-to-one

931
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,440
if the multi multiple to multiple

932
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,920
scenario that to exist we think that the

933
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,640
solution also it can meet the

934
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,420
requirements

935
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,140
next please

936
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,140
this is one example for the whole

937
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,540
solution

938
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:55,920
from the bottom up to the physical

939
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,359
network is divided into two inner pieces

940
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:04,859
through the flex elbow and the hnrp is

941
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,700
mapped to two one slice one is for

942
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,880
education and the other is for the

943
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,900
healthcare and the corresponding black

944
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,920
alcohol ID is

945
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,940
128 and 129

946
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,559
uh fold the education slides there are

947
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,200
two customers

948
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,440
University one University two they have

949
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,300
different exercise points and

950
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,300
interactions

951
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,400
for Health Care slices literally there

952
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,300
is only one customers so for the second

953
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,700
level

954
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,440
slice there is only one slice

955
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,599
yourself

956
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:00,859
so next please

957
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,940
um based on the topology

958
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,480
previous the resource partition is like

959
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,760
this

960
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,260
slide shows for pe1 the physical

961
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,680
interface one there will be two sub

962
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,059
interfaces

963
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:29,099
and the under which there will be two or

964
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,500
one kill respectively

965
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,819
this is for the second the level slice

966
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:38,579
for physical interface two there will be

967
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,420
only one sub interface and one queue

968
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,980
under the sub interfaces

969
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,579
from this picture all the sub interfaces

970
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:54,000
and the kills are associated with the

971
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,599
dedicated bandwidth which can guarantee

972
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,619
the slice resource

973
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:06,059
uh okay masterpiece

974
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,700
and this is the last picture which

975
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,640
illustrates the traffic forwarding uh

976
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,000
the final result is that for the normal

977
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,700
education traffic

978
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,819
it's it is

979
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:27,740
encapsulated

980
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,800
with the understated and also associated

981
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,240
with the specific flux alcohol and it's

982
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,140
to forward data through the layer series

983
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,800
of interfaces and photos specific

984
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,160
traffic from University one and the

985
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,160
university to

986
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,119
accept the activistics either

987
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,680
SRH

988
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,440
the encapsulation also includes the

989
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,720
additional NRP ID

990
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,839
and with the traffic is folded through

991
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:08,420
the queue under the sub interfaces

992
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,960
and okay that's all

993
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,740
next is

994
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,319
okay just just a moment before we go on

995
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,900
I just I was looking at the room and I

996
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,700
saw a couple of people who don't have

997
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,640
masks on masks on over your nose and

998
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,859
mouth please unless you're eating thank

999
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:31,040
you

1000
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,359
you may continue

1001
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:38,280
okay okay since it has been presented in

1002
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,359
this and there is no objection we still

1003
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:46,140
just so we also look forward to your

1004
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,559
commands from Spring and also want to

1005
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,280
know if we can move forward for this

1006
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,520
draft

1007
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,760
thank you

1008
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,680
okay Ted Hardy

1009
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,280
Cisco thank you very much for this very

1010
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,740
interesting draft I I have three fairly

1011
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,119
quick questions

1012
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,280
uh the first in in terms of

1013
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,540
[Music]

1014
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,339
just to confirm my understanding this is

1015
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:20,160
an informational draft that requires no

1016
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,559
protocol changes as far as I could see

1017
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,200
so I'm I'm not sure what work you're

1018
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,119
asking spring to to take up a

1019
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,339
clarification of that would be useful

1020
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:33,240
uh second looking through the draft it

1021
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,920
looked like the hierarchical nature of

1022
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,780
it would normally allow you to have one

1023
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,260
level of the hierarchy managed by Sr and

1024
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,359
another level of the hierarchy managed

1025
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:44,099
by something else in your University

1026
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,640
example you might have the overall set

1027
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,380
of universities

1028
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,900
um those resources in a slice that was

1029
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,900
being managed by Sr and some but not all

1030
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,420
of the slices for specific universities

1031
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,359
being in either Sr or mpls or something

1032
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:02,400
else and I wanted to confirm whether you

1033
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,160
thought that that was possible in in the

1034
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,540
approach you're taking or whether the

1035
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,599
linkage to the underlying nrps made that

1036
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,800
impractical

1037
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,140
and the last question was uh this is

1038
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,680
obviously very early work a zero zero I

1039
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,099
didn't see any uh IPR disclosures for it

1040
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:21,660
but I wondered if the authors knew of

1041
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,339
any that were in preparation

1042
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,900
uh thank you again for the interesting

1043
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,140
draft

1044
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,500
hi okay thank you for your comments I

1045
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,460
will try to answer your question if I

1046
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,520
cannot answer it clearly

1047
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,119
um welcome to move it to the main list

1048
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,880
uh first of all

1049
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,780
about the solution I think it's an

1050
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,099
informational solution yes you are right

1051
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:56,940
and there is no other extensions on

1052
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,720
practicals

1053
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,760
session again I think your mic is on and

1054
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,559
we're getting some weird Effects by that

1055
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,440
the end could you go on

1056
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,800
okay uh it's okay now

1057
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,559
yeah the problem is fixed thank you

1058
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,700
okay okay okay uh sorry uh so I'll

1059
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,559
continue all

1060
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,260
um because there is no other extension

1061
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,359
on this uh solution so we just propose

1062
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:33,180
this to uh check whether the solution if

1063
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,579
there is any conflictions with the

1064
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:36,859
spring

1065
00:58:36,859 --> 00:58:41,520
spring opinions uh so we think it's

1066
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,359
informational document

1067
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:48,319
the second one about the true level

1068
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,599
hierarchical slides I think the first

1069
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,740
level we use the flex algo is for the

1070
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,799
control plan and because of the

1071
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,619
limitation of the control plan

1072
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:06,000
um it's very difficult to realize the

1073
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
multiple

1074
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:14,520
um slice so we proposed that the second

1075
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,900
level slice which is

1076
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:22,140
from the forwarding data plate data plan

1077
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,579
so the second level I think they are

1078
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:30,720
also based on the srv6 segment routine

1079
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,260
because we combined it with the SR

1080
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:39,799
policy of the services package folding

1081
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:43,579
an rpid such as

1082
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:49,680
so I think the total solution is related

1083
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,240
with the s36

1084
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,480
oh the second one I'm so sorry I can't

1085
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,520
repeat it

1086
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,040
again it was just a quick question of

1087
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,319
whether you knew of any IPR uh

1088
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,400
disclosures in process

1089
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,119
oh no no I am not aware of any NPR

1090
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,339
disclosure

1091
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:15,839
again for both your answers on the

1092
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,400
interesting draft

1093
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,940
okay

1094
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,720
yes can you hear me

1095
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,020
yes we can hear you

1096
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,040
um yeah I just had a question

1097
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:40,020
is there um in your examples you had two

1098
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,660
layers of hierarchy is it possible to

1099
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,380
have

1100
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,500
more than two layers hierarchy

1101
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,700
um

1102
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,200
as well

1103
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,200
um I guess with with the uh

1104
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,720
the semantics of the draft is there is

1105
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,940
there anything special that's being done

1106
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,700
other than what's uh defined and um you

1107
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,020
know that's part of segment where I

1108
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,819
think the standard

1109
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:05,700
um is there are there any um

1110
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,500
a special

1111
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,640
um

1112
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,280
Diana

1113
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,579
requirements related

1114
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,520
thank you thank you thank you very much

1115
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,760
it's a good question we also have

1116
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,720
thought about it later from now on

1117
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,839
um the full Channel mobile it's a real

1118
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,700
natural it it's just the true level

1119
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:37,079
slice for example I think a different

1120
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:39,740
business units with the operator

1121
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,720
government Affairs departments or

1122
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,460
Enterprises of Affairs Department

1123
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,720
under this there will be different users

1124
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,500
and another example for the operator we

1125
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,540
think for China mobile there are several

1126
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,200
sub operators several sub operators

1127
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,520
located at different provinces they also

1128
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,819
want to manage their own provinces with

1129
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:12,599
business independently so I think this

1130
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,200
financial is very special

1131
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,339
for China mobile operator

1132
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,720
we also

1133
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:30,259
need the true level hierarchical slices

1134
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:37,319
thank you thank you okay we need to keep

1135
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:38,819
moving we're starting to fall behind

1136
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:41,839
schedule folks

1137
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,660
so next is a SRA sm2 for Sr policy again

1138
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,960
speaking if you could try to pick closer

1139
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,180
to the mic I am we're not hearing you

1140
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,220
very well every every time thank you

1141
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,578
okay

1142
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,359
um give me one second I'm just going to

1143
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:09,299
try to make an adjustment to my Nick

1144
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:11,160
and just if you could let me know if it

1145
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,879
sounds any better

1146
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,240
does that sound better

1147
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,480
no but that's okay thank you

1148
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,480
it doesn't it doesn't sound any better

1149
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,280
okay all right let me just I'll just try

1150
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,460
to speak a little bit closer to the mic

1151
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,780
thank you

1152
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,880
hi my name is Leon Mishra I'm with

1153
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,400
Verizon and I'm presenting the draft of

1154
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,119
SRP MTU for Sr policy on behalf of

1155
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,380
co-authors

1156
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,220
next slide

1157
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,319
so a recap some ministry as to how this

1158
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,540
draft came to spring so during the

1159
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:59,460
adoption of draft uh PCP set pmtu a need

1160
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,040
for a document and spring was requested

1161
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,200
and confirmed that both the pce and

1162
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,319
spring working groups so an IDR document

1163
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:10,740
was adopted in April 2020 a discussion

1164
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,619
was brought up by Caitlin that the

1165
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,319
concept of path MTU assess our policy

1166
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,960
and its applicability applicability

1167
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,000
should be first defined in the spring

1168
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,500
working year before we introduce

1169
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,280
signaling aspects in bgp as a result of

1170
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,700
the PC PMG extension adoption called the

1171
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,280
draft piece of pmtu was maintained only

1172
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,520
protocol specific extensions of details

1173
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,740
while the SR policy path M2 definition

1174
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,020
framework was to be developed in the

1175
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,640
spring working group as a standards

1176
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,859
track document to ensure vendor

1177
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:46,500
interoperability related to srpmtu

1178
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,740
Concepts and computation details

1179
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,900
this topic came up is a critical issue

1180
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,880
to be addressed during the IDR working

1181
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,059
group 2020 to GPS our policy to MTU

1182
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,339
adoption call and now again during PC

1183
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:02,819
workload 2022 pm2 adoption call as

1184
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:04,440
mentioned above and due to the

1185
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,299
criticality of solving this issue

1186
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:08,520
related to handling fragmentation and

1187
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,099
fragmentation avoidance procedures using

1188
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:15,440
SRP MTU next slide

1189
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:19,140
updates from revision zero to revision

1190
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,500
one so mostly cleanup there was an

1191
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,180
update as well on the Securities

1192
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,880
consideration section so the addition of

1193
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,540
the SRP MCU constraint information can

1194
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,579
be sensitive in some defined and can be

1195
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:35,460
used to influence the SR path setup and

1196
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,040
selection results in it and which

1197
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,260
results in an adverse effect

1198
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,359
the protocol extension that includes the

1199
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,119
SRP MTU must be take must take this into

1200
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,520
consideration this document does not

1201
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,380
define any new protocol extension and

1202
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,420
test does not introduce any further

1203
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,720
security considerations and then as well

1204
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,880
another update was the section section

1205
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,640
three the SRP empty enforcement

1206
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,339
reference to separate extension to

1207
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:04,680
handle pm2 draft result was also

1208
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,940
obtained

1209
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,960
next slide

1210
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,880
so next steps we would like to get some

1211
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,119
feedback on some critical aspects of

1212
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,339
this graph from the working group

1213
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:21,960
experts

1214
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,359
um one one of the questions that we have

1215
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:28,260
as far from from us authors is sfpm2 TI

1216
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,359
LFA computation and fragmentation

1217
01:06:30,359 --> 01:06:33,119
caveats so if anyone can think of after

1218
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,359
reading through the draft of any caveats

1219
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,579
related to tilfa

1220
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:39,480
um

1221
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,440
a computation at the plr node to the uh

1222
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,920
to the merge point in any any um any uh

1223
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,079
any of that bypass Loop and any

1224
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:50,819
fragmentation crappy outside related

1225
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:52,020
there

1226
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:54,180
um another question that we have and we

1227
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,400
want to get feedback from them from the

1228
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,780
working group as well as srpmq srv60

1229
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,400
encapsulation and any fragmentation

1230
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,339
caveats there when that happened and

1231
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:07,740
then the last question is The srpmt

1232
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,039
Binding Sid path computation caveat so

1233
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,640
on the source node where the uh

1234
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,220
as our policy candidate Panthers

1235
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,260
bouncing forwarding plate then The

1236
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,720
Binding sit is popped and then the

1237
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,720
labels are pushed onto the label stack

1238
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,680
or in the srv6 case the SRH header and

1239
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,660
the srv6 package is pushed onto the

1240
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,220
label stack

1241
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,859
um are there any computation caveats

1242
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:36,539
that were missing we just want to make

1243
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:39,660
sure that we we recover all our bases in

1244
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,240
the draft and any any questions or

1245
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,920
comments we really appreciate any

1246
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,380
feedback on the graph next slide

1247
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,319
and so this traffic is fairly

1248
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,640
straightforward

1249
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,039
um what would like to take any comments

1250
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:57,900
to the mailing list uh but we would like

1251
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,240
to ask for work group adoption on this

1252
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,200
job thank you

1253
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,579
any any comment on questions

1254
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,238
is

1255
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,620
don't know what's happening

1256
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:29,520
yes thank you very much again

1257
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,660
okay thank you

1258
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,500
so we are now moving to 7600ps

1259
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,479
interworking uh from Square

1260
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,520
hello everyone I am swadesh Agarwal from

1261
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,359
Cisco Systems uh this document describes

1262
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,819
the srv6 and mpls interworking

1263
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:00,839
procedures

1264
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:03,238
and I present this on the behalf of all

1265
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:06,359
my co-authors next slide please

1266
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:09,660
yeah this is slides shows the simple

1267
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,120
view of the interworking scenarios in

1268
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,279
the green we are showing the srv6 domain

1269
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,859
in the orange we are showing mpls domain

1270
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:18,779
and the tasked overall is for the

1271
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,279
interworking functions has to be

1272
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:21,420
executed

1273
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,299
the document

1274
01:09:23,299 --> 01:09:25,738
divides the problem into two set of

1275
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:27,600
things one is a transport interworking

1276
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,759
and the service interworking in the

1277
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,679
transport interworking what happens is

1278
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,839
and from the end to end from the service

1279
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,600
point of view it's running either srv6

1280
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,899
vpns or the mpls vpns and since

1281
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:42,479
end-to-end is an srv6 VPN we need to

1282
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,219
provide a transport reachability to

1283
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:47,279
locators and that's what we call srv6

1284
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,859
over mpls we we do interworking

1285
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:52,560
functions for the locators on these Dash

1286
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,980
oval boxes and for the when we have a

1287
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,679
mpls vpn's edge service is running end

1288
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,260
to end we need to provide a interworking

1289
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:05,040
procedures on those test boxes ovals on

1290
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,160
whenever the data plate changes and that

1291
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,340
happens for mpls or an srv6 domain and

1292
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,840
the and the last case we cover is

1293
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,000
service intervoking in this case we have

1294
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,340
to provide connectivity between srv6 VPN

1295
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:21,000
and mpls VPN and you need to do a

1296
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,800
intervoking function on some data

1297
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,860
working box next slide please

1298
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,260
so for interworking functions the

1299
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,719
document describes new behaviors one is

1300
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,179
the n dot DTM what this Behavior does is

1301
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:36,179
it's decapsulates an slv6 pack-in and

1302
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:37,800
look up the UN it's carrying an

1303
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,840
underlying label below it and it lookups

1304
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,360
the label in the mpls table and we will

1305
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,760
see how this is used in as you go in the

1306
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,520
procedures and you can see the sudo code

1307
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,920
in the draft next slide please

1308
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,620
and the DPM behavior is it's a

1309
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:55,260
decapsulation and push the label

1310
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,500
associated with the Sid and again it is

1311
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,140
used here we can see how it will be used

1312
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,179
in our slides as we go through this and

1313
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:04,920
the pseudo code could be referred again

1314
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,659
can be checked in the draft next slide

1315
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:08,280
please

1316
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,100
so these are the and hidden behaviors we

1317
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,780
have defined so what happens is when the

1318
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:16,140
H dot encaps is applied to an mpls label

1319
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,360
stack that's what we call H Dot and caps

1320
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,520
dot m and there is both the regular

1321
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,980
Behavior and the reduced behavior for it

1322
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:25,440
next slide please

1323
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,920
so Sr policy is bound to an binding set

1324
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,120
so in the procedures if the SRM pillars

1325
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,179
label can be bound to an srv6 policy as

1326
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:39,480
well as sr66 can be bound to an Sr mpls

1327
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,820
policy so we call these in the draft as

1328
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,980
interconnecting binding set and we'll

1329
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,080
we'll see this concept is used to

1330
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,239
provide those interworking functions

1331
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,540
in the next slide next next slide please

1332
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,640
as already mentioned when the services

1333
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,820
are of the same type end to end and we

1334
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,440
need to provide a reachability either to

1335
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,739
her if it's srv6 VP into a locator or if

1336
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:05,040
it is a mpls VPN services to a p

1337
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,800
loopback so what it is draft does is it

1338
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,420
extends the two well-known transport

1339
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,980
procedures to provide this interworking

1340
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,080
to create this interworking control

1341
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,840
plane one is a srpc base which can

1342
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,640
provide both the best effort as well as

1343
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,739
the intend away another one is the bgp

1344
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,360
interdomain routing which is right now

1345
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,219
described for best effort but we will

1346
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:28,080
Define it for the intent aware based on

1347
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,239
bgp also in the future versions next

1348
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,460
slide please

1349
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,739
so just to go over the procedures the

1350
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:37,199
Legends used are the green boxes are

1351
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,600
sizes capable and it shows how the

1352
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,760
locators have been referred in that and

1353
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,159
the orange boxes are mpls capable boxes

1354
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,440
and then the orange and green bar the

1355
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,199
are capable of both mpls and srv6 next

1356
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,600
slide please

1357
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,239
so we see these are srpc based

1358
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,780
procedures so let's say between 1 and 10

1359
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:00,140
we are running the srv6 VPN Services

1360
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,360
it's been advertised by the 10 learned

1361
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,360
by the one a VPN service and what the

1362
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,100
endpoint or locator we want to reach is

1363
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,739
of a node 10 B10 is a locator we want to

1364
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:13,260
reach it's a multi-domain network one

1365
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,239
doesn't know how to reach one request an

1366
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:18,239
srpc for the a certain objective or a

1367
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:21,239
constraint for a path to 10 srpcs look

1368
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:23,640
at the constraint it figures out the

1369
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,940
let's say node 2 Note 5 and node 8 are

1370
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,460
in the path to provide that objective or

1371
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,219
a constraint but since srpc is having

1372
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:34,500
the bgp ls feed from each other domain

1373
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,380
srpc sees there's an inconsistent data

1374
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,940
plane happening on node four and seven

1375
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:41,100
so what it does is whatever

1376
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,219
interconnecting sets we use the the

1377
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,140
procedures we Define of interconnecting

1378
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,880
sets it use that behavior what it does

1379
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,820
is on the Note 4 since we have to take

1380
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:53,100
the policy 200 fabulous domain it

1381
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,400
creates an mpls policy but the The

1382
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,219
Binding said it's bound to is an srb6

1383
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:03,120
Beast SRB behavior of the BM type and

1384
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,040
that's and that uh srb6 BC is being once

1385
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,080
srpc creates that policy on the four and

1386
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,120
it and that's the one which is

1387
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,640
programmed at the one with one of the

1388
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,340
segments which takes to the node 4 and

1389
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,860
which will get uh expanded on node 4 to

1390
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,500
the policy MPS policy and that's where

1391
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,219
the packet would Transit

1392
01:14:25,219 --> 01:14:28,080
transition through the mpls domain so if

1393
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,699
you see on the Note 4 what packet

1394
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,800
received is is received with the

1395
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,199
destination with the BM Behavior we will

1396
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:37,020
apply the BM behavior on it and then the

1397
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,760
packet would be put into an amplus

1398
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,739
labels stack which will take us to the

1399
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:42,960
again the objective was to reach node 4

1400
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,140
node 5 from 4 and that's what the prefix

1401
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,940
it we have put in the packet and then

1402
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,920
the last segment we have put is a note 7

1403
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,500
where on the Note 7 and it would be a

1404
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,780
regular sr6 domain and it will go to the

1405
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,360
next segment which is node 8 and of

1406
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,739
course the VPN segment which will take

1407
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:00,179
to the note 10. so that's the way

1408
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:02,880
interconnecting by index it is used to

1409
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,940
provide that

1410
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:08,100
6 over M reachability through srpc next

1411
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,540
slide please

1412
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,460
so it is similar Behavior it's a similar

1413
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,620
operations that I have already explained

1414
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,900
for 6 over M the only difference is here

1415
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,840
the edge services are mpls VPN services

1416
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,420
so we need to create this srpc request

1417
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,580
is for the P loop back it's it's called

1418
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,880
for a certain C comma e which is an mpls

1419
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,699
in the mpls case here on the Note 4 what

1420
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:32,699
we are doing is we are putting an srb6

1421
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,040
policy because middle domain is an srb6

1422
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,100
domain that policy but it is bound to an

1423
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,340
mpls B said and that mpls BC that is

1424
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,739
programmed for the policy on node 4 is

1425
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,659
programmed as one of the segments on the

1426
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:48,179
Node one so now what happens is when the

1427
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:49,980
packet leaves one it is going through

1428
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,500
the segments in the left domain on the

1429
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,100
Note 4 it is expanded to a srv6 policy

1430
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,920
with the the next header being 137

1431
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,840
because getting an MPS payload below it

1432
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,020
and then the packet will be reaching the

1433
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,239
Note 7 and the regular mpls operations

1434
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,760
will happen from there onwards next

1435
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,860
slide please

1436
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,860
so these are we have covered the srbc PC

1437
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,679
based procedures where PC was aware of

1438
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:18,420
this interworking procedures and was

1439
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,860
creating those using the enter

1440
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,380
connecting sets to create those uh pass

1441
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,179
through to the different type of data

1442
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,400
plane but similarly bgp interdomain

1443
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,199
procedures can be used so in this again

1444
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:30,540
it's over it's a scenario of 6 over M

1445
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:33,659
where the services are Sr V6 VPN

1446
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:35,460
services so now what we need to do is

1447
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,920
when 10 advertise the service to node

1448
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,900
one then we'll also advertise the

1449
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,560
locator through a locator to node 7 from

1450
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,020
Note 7 to Note 4 to node one when it's

1451
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,600
advertised between 7 to 4 what you need

1452
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,460
to do is it's a it's a regular IPv6

1453
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,239
prefix over an elude mpls transport so

1454
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,340
we can use the 6p procedures between

1455
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,679
four and between seven and four and

1456
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:00,120
that's that's the way traffic will flow

1457
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,420
from one to ten next slide please

1458
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,620
so this is the case of uh mplus being in

1459
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,960
the edge and that means it's an mpls VPN

1460
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,760
services so we need to provide a

1461
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,520
reachability to node 10 that has to be

1462
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,600
learned by the node one which is

1463
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,420
learning the services uh from the 10. to

1464
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:21,020
provide that reachability today we know

1465
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,000
bgp3107 procedures seamless mpls is used

1466
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,260
where what will happen is on on the 7 we

1467
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:32,100
will allocate a regular vtp Lu label but

1468
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,900
along with that we will advertise an

1469
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,659
srv6 set of the behavior DTM which was

1470
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:39,000
defined earlier right and that would be

1471
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,739
learned by the Note 4 and Note 4 will

1472
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,440
advertise this bgplu further to node one

1473
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,840
so for node one it's a regular mpls VPN

1474
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,719
put into bgplu LSP but on the Note 4

1475
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,120
yeah we will do swap operation for bgplu

1476
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,100
LSP but along with that we will tunnel

1477
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,560
the traffic to node 7 with the DTM

1478
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,440
Behavior but it will cause is we are

1479
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,020
carrying a bgplu label below uh below

1480
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,679
that srv68 so on the the Note 7 we will

1481
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:06,780
decapsulate the packet to the lookup of

1482
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,640
the bgplu label and send to node 10. so

1483
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,140
that's the way we'll provide end-to-end

1484
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,020
reachability over the SR V6 domain next

1485
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,300
slide please

1486
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,460
so these are the cases of Transport

1487
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,020
interworking where we were trying to

1488
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,300
provide a reachability towards the

1489
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,880
service endpoint but in this case what

1490
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,199
we want to in this this is a service

1491
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,719
interworking where we want to provide a

1492
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:30,179
connectivity between mpls VPN and srv6

1493
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:33,179
VPN running on the Node 1 and node 7. so

1494
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:35,120
what happens in this case is there are

1495
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,880
these are

1496
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,840
these are working on the existing

1497
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,880
Gateway procedures what happens is on

1498
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,000
node 4 we have a service awareness

1499
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,800
because we want to terminate both the

1500
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,560
services as the as well as the underlay

1501
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,780
so since we want to terminate both the

1502
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,580
what we can do is we can have a service

1503
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:56,540
Awareness on node four so whatever is

1504
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,679
destinations VPN destinations are

1505
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:01,020
learned from the sr6 domain they are put

1506
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,940
into the work on the service on the

1507
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,100
service box Note 4 and then reordered it

1508
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,140
towards the mpls side so there is MPS

1509
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,900
VPN and s56 VPN and on the service box

1510
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,060
there is a verb IP forwarding which is

1511
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,580
uh when you receive a traffic from one

1512
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,980
side you Decap you look at you do an

1513
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,600
iplooker and then you get the

1514
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,699
encapsulation for the other side and

1515
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:22,440
that's the way as we provide the

1516
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,480
interworking solution for this scenario

1517
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,640
next slide please

1518
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,860
so this is the last case where instead

1519
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,480
of having a service Awareness on the

1520
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,580
Note 4 what we can do is on the

1521
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,380
interworking box we can do a translation

1522
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,140
that means a VPN label could be

1523
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:39,440
translated to an uh

1524
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,960
vpn's srv6 service set or the SR physics

1525
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,179
service set can be translated to a VPN

1526
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:48,060
label using a procedure similar to

1527
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,560
interest option b

1528
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,600
uh doing the next 12 cell phone dot box

1529
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,239
next slide please

1530
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,460
yeah somebody is the staff was presented

1531
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,179
uh first published in 2018 and it has

1532
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:01,920
the data plane and the associated

1533
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,840
control plane procedures it defines a

1534
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,780
new Behavior DTM and DPM as well as use

1535
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,580
the introduce the concept of

1536
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,620
interconnecting binding sits and it uses

1537
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,260
how to pass through a data plane which

1538
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,140
is not consistent

1539
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:18,300
it relies both on the srpc and bgp based

1540
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,080
Solutions next slide please

1541
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,120
next slide please yeah so one thing we

1542
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,739
have done is from the last ITF we have

1543
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,780
moved the bgp protocol extensions that

1544
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,000
we have to a separate draft so it can be

1545
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,280
reviewed in the best working group and

1546
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,199
this is done for both it for the

1547
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:35,640
independent review as well as future

1548
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,440
application applicability for the other

1549
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,900
use cases as well as we have expanded on

1550
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,120
the uh interest option b like procedures

1551
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,880
for the service interworking

1552
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,920
next slide please

1553
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,620
yeah uh we would like uh the working

1554
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,239
group to review as well as adopt this

1555
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:53,460
draft also one thing more uh there's

1556
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:55,440
another transport interworking draft pin

1557
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,420
there in the spring we are working with

1558
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,699
the co-authors of those of that draft

1559
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:01,980
because there's a similar one similar

1560
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,080
Behavior being defined to see how to

1561
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,540
move forward on that

1562
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,140
thanks

1563
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,460
okay truth

1564
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,320
oh

1565
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,659
Jeff you got to put yourself on the list

1566
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:18,060
uh hi a Swedish very good presentation

1567
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,280
thank you one quick question about the

1568
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,679
PC part uh currently in the document you

1569
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:25,380
are focusing only on a single PC case in

1570
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,000
peace up working group we have one more

1571
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,679
document called stateful interdomain

1572
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:30,780
where how the PCS can cooperate with

1573
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:33,000
each other to set up this kind of path

1574
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,980
so just have a look at it I hope that

1575
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,500
the solution can work for inter-domain

1576
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,540
cases like where multi multiple PC

1577
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,699
managing multiple domain cases as well

1578
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:44,100
sure I I've been looking at that and

1579
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,980
probably we can get back on thank you

1580
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,780
what we can do

1581
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:51,659
just Japanese or Microsoft so the drop

1582
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:54,900
notably means a separational part how do

1583
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,400
you deploy the stuff how do you operate

1584
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,739
it end to end and I mean amount of Buffs

1585
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,780
when you're going to deploy this it's

1586
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,699
just scary right so it would be really

1587
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:06,060
good to see sections that identifies how

1588
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,800
do I trace when it Traverse different

1589
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,020
calculation different domains when I

1590
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,820
replace

1591
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,400
seats by labels and so forth right it's

1592
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,440
completely missing in the draft so if

1593
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,940
you're saying the operational aspects

1594
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:21,360
absolutely uh sure we can we can look

1595
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,739
into it thank you update thanks

1596
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,659
uh you should put yourself on using the

1597
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:32,640
tool but just state your name at the

1598
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,719
microphone please

1599
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,760
um to the point which Jeff was making I

1600
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,780
think there should be a separate

1601
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,460
operational draft yeah we can look into

1602
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,020
it that's one thing let's

1603
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,140
looking at that part covered okay sure

1604
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,239
hey

1605
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:04,640
um

1606
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,480
so you said that there is another

1607
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,900
drafting base for the uh pure bgp

1608
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,239
procedures for the for the signaling

1609
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,280
aspect to because we are extending to

1610
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,739
carry these new behaviors in the bgp in

1611
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:19,500
the bgp transport layer like pgplu or in

1612
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,219
bgp IPv6 so we have put a earlier that

1613
01:23:23,219 --> 01:23:25,800
was in this draft but uh to have a

1614
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,480
future applicability as well as to a

1615
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,100
category Group by the best we have put

1616
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,440
in the those signaling aspects we have

1617
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,060
put in sector draft and the architecture

1618
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,860
and the procedures are still keptical in

1619
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,800
this draft but also for the option b uh

1620
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,960
section because at the moment it's only

1621
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,500
covering the uh ldu part right no no

1622
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,780
option b is for the services right we

1623
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,400
can do next stop self on the

1624
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,980
interworking box where our srv6 service

1625
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:52,500
it can be mapped to a VPN label and the

1626
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,179
outgoing LSP and same on the reverse

1627
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:56,940
direction right so it's using a DPM

1628
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,219
Behavior to achieve it

1629
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:00,960
right so it's a next stop sell for the

1630
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,120
services not for the transport so you're

1631
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,860
saying there is there's no need for

1632
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,440
extended procedures in the best draft

1633
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,860
for the option b uh we can look into it

1634
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,239
but it's just because option b is

1635
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,100
already defined in certain aspects this

1636
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,620
is more of using those procedures to

1637
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:18,360
create this but the behavior is a new

1638
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,040
Behavior DPM that's the reason we have

1639
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,199
put it out so that everybody knows we

1640
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:23,640
have to use a DPM Behavior we have to

1641
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,199
push our labels that stack of labels

1642
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,420
when I receive a subjected that's the

1643
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,679
reason we have put it out otherwise from

1644
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:31,380
control plane I still feel existing

1645
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,880
procedures should work it's just some

1646
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,400
data plane and update to that we can

1647
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,239
discuss thank you

1648
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:41,239
thanks a lot

1649
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:53,239
thank you

1650
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,360
next is a Sr policy group from lion

1651
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,520
well okay okay thank you

1652
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:06,900
hi and this is Leah again uh I'm talking

1653
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,380
about the other topic as our policy

1654
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:14,040
group next up please

1655
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,280
foreign

1656
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,280
flows of the simulator have different

1657
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,219
requirements on the folding quality of

1658
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:39,440
the network

1659
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:44,040
so different traffic is expected to be

1660
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,659
forwarded through different passes and

1661
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:51,260
use different network resources

1662
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:54,620
taking the left picture as an example

1663
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,620
there are two completely isolated VPN

1664
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:03,120
tenants within one and vaping 2 they are

1665
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,020
both multipoint to multi-pond excise and

1666
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,179
the whipping one has three different

1667
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:12,719
types of sources within two has two

1668
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,199
different types of sources each sources

1669
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:20,760
has different quality requirements first

1670
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:24,060
from the picture you can see that all

1671
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:27,980
the traffic belongs to the same VPN

1672
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:32,760
is expected to be managed in a unified

1673
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:37,100
manner so here

1674
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:41,580
we still the the traffic into one is a

1675
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,980
policy group

1676
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:46,380
so the traffic

1677
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,199
belongs to the SR policy group who have

1678
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,600
different sources and the different

1679
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,179
destination addresses

1680
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:57,480
and the next different type of sources

1681
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:01,080
the traffic under the VPN can be steered

1682
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,980
into different policies

1683
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:07,260
which is based on the parent policy the

1684
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,120
traffic

1685
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:12,719
has a specific source and destination

1686
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,139
address

1687
01:27:15,139 --> 01:27:18,500
next please

1688
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:20,839
foreign

1689
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,739
this is the terminology which is defined

1690
01:27:25,739 --> 01:27:29,280
here first the SR policy and the parent

1691
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,100
is a policy are defined in RFC

1692
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:40,080
9256 already and the New Concept of the

1693
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:45,260
as a policy group is newly proposed here

1694
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,880
and

1695
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,460
generally speaking it is an

1696
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:53,699
instantiation of a cyto apparent as a

1697
01:27:53,699 --> 01:27:57,239
policies this as a policies have

1698
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:01,920
different destination and points and

1699
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:07,139
the same service for the module and it

1700
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:09,960
represents a set of passes with

1701
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,980
different folding requirements and

1702
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:15,960
computed by different parents as a

1703
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,000
policies

1704
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,300
which have the same color but different

1705
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,300
destination and points

1706
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:27,000
also the mapping relationship between

1707
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,179
the flow characteristics and the color

1708
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:33,719
value of the as a policy path should be

1709
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:37,860
established in the policy group and it

1710
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:42,000
can get the flows with different SLA

1711
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,060
requirements to the as a policy with

1712
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,480
different colors

1713
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,900
next please

1714
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,860
this is the identification of the ISR

1715
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:59,159
policy group who an Israel policy group

1716
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:02,760
must be identified through a colored

1717
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,400
tribute

1718
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:09,560
this color is an unsigned non-dural

1719
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:14,940
32-bit integer value and it corresponds

1720
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:18,060
to the color of the building of the bgp

1721
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:21,080
root published by the endpoint

1722
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,120
uh and this is third one second

1723
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,139
different stories qualities use

1724
01:29:27,139 --> 01:29:31,159
different color values

1725
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:37,500
the next sentence is also uh talking

1726
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,679
about the mapping relationship between

1727
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:42,960
the flow characteristics and the color

1728
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:43,860
value

1729
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:48,719
the same with the previous three slides

1730
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,159
so next please

1731
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,800
the relationship of the policy group

1732
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,239
parent policy and the as our policy is

1733
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:06,020
shown as the pictures

1734
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:08,480
first

1735
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,020
in simple terms and as a policy group

1736
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:17,100
contains one or more parents as our

1737
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,820
policies which have different

1738
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,260
destinations on the point

1739
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,980
and the color of the policy group should

1740
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:30,540
be seen with the parent as a policy but

1741
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:34,920
different with the SR policy

1742
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,560
thank you

1743
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,980
next please

1744
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:45,780
this slides detailed the process of the

1745
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,540
traffic steering using the SR policy

1746
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:52,560
group for for the egg rice nodes which

1747
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,380
published The btp Root it will

1748
01:30:57,739 --> 01:31:01,440
associate the b2p route with the color

1749
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,460
extended Community attribute and the

1750
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:09,440
photo increase node first

1751
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,940
it will match an Sr policy group

1752
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,580
using the color extended Community

1753
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:21,800
attribute in the BP route and the next

1754
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,860
it will match apparent as a policy under

1755
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,639
the previous policy group

1756
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:33,560
using the next hope in BCP root and then

1757
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:38,480
it will match as a policy using the flow

1758
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,760
characteristics

1759
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:45,600
through the three steps finally the flow

1760
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:51,320
is still into one specific as a policy

1761
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,799
next please

1762
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,260
this is an informational module of the

1763
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,860
Apple Logic

1764
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:07,560
from this picture you can see that there

1765
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,840
is

1766
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:12,920
one ISR policy group for pt1

1767
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:17,460
which is with the color one and it

1768
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:21,080
contains the two parents as a policy

1769
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:26,460
uh pp1 and pp2 and they have the same

1770
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:31,020
color one with the policy group pt1 but

1771
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,500
different endpoint

1772
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:39,600
U1 and E2 and each parent as a policy

1773
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,860
contains three threes

1774
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:45,239
corresponding to three different

1775
01:32:45,239 --> 01:32:50,719
policies which is with the color 100 to

1776
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:52,520
2300

1777
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,400
this picture shows the basic logical of

1778
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,699
the relationship

1779
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:02,219
uh okay

1780
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:05,360
uh next place

1781
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:09,420
uh that's all and this is the the real

1782
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:13,500
version of the draft so welcome any

1783
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,139
question or comments

1784
01:33:16,139 --> 01:33:19,280
thank you very much

1785
01:33:27,739 --> 01:33:31,739
if you could go back to the slide uh

1786
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:34,100
uh Bruno

1787
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:39,120
uh yeah so one question uh Sr policy

1788
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,600
Group which is a new uh new thing that

1789
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,159
has been introduced here

1790
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:47,219
does this belong on the head end or is

1791
01:33:47,219 --> 01:33:51,320
this something that's on the controller

1792
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:55,560
uh

1793
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,800
assuming that

1794
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:02,219
the SR policy group who

1795
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:06,600
that's how any height on the point

1796
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,360
so it's at the head end okay so I am not

1797
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:12,360
able to see uh what is the benefit that

1798
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:15,239
this group uh brings uh it would be good

1799
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:19,020
if the draft could be updated to clarify

1800
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,360
what cannot be done or achieved with

1801
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:25,020
what we have today uh before uh and so

1802
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:27,480
therefore we know why we need this new

1803
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,280
construct

1804
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,480
yeah so the child

1805
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,739
also the cause of this draft I would

1806
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:39,739
like you to answer the question so

1807
01:34:39,739 --> 01:34:45,840
firstly I think the here the uh policy

1808
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:50,219
group will not introduce any new uh

1809
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:54,900
Hider or new change to the data plan and

1810
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:58,040
the the second one

1811
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:03,360
we use that based on maybe a controller

1812
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,420
or some

1813
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:09,139
other network management system

1814
01:35:09,139 --> 01:35:12,320
so that that is logically

1815
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,699
uh module to organize

1816
01:35:16,699 --> 01:35:18,260
the

1817
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:22,320
hierarchical services so we just talked

1818
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,080
talked about the hierarchical network

1819
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:29,040
slides so when we use the uh a services

1820
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,380
policy to implement the

1821
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:38,600
hierarchical uh slicing uh Zuca

1822
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,739
solution can be uh used at that

1823
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:45,900
application scenario

1824
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,138
foreign

1825
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:03,300
ER so maybe uh some clarity more uh more

1826
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,960
clarity in the draft

1827
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:09,960
um yeah I think the important value is

1828
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,860
that it's a high up to organize just

1829
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:16,440
different uh

1830
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:22,679
uh policies uh for such as the same user

1831
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:27,179
or the same kind of service

1832
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:32,060
so if you can use those uh concept

1833
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:37,260
then you can very easy to set up the

1834
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:40,380
hierarchical uh

1835
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:45,679
Services based on a services policy

1836
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:49,800
a very very last bit uh

1837
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,440
for taking the time but we have all

1838
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,900
kinds of template and hierarchies in you

1839
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,840
know of all the vendors uh config models

1840
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,120
right uh the question is here why

1841
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,760
standardize it uh you know you can do

1842
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,679
whatever you want in your controller or

1843
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:06,360
ahead and implementation

1844
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,639
uh if we are standardizing it should

1845
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:11,760
bring some functional value and that's

1846
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,920
not clear to me uh thank you I'll end

1847
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,139
here now

1848
01:37:15,139 --> 01:37:18,920
okay Boris

1849
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,540
describe

1850
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:23,940
a very short question because I missed

1851
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:27,719
we have two colors here one color Fair

1852
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:31,380
Sr policy group and second color for Sr

1853
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:35,100
policy inside this group so how these

1854
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,800
two colors resolution will be done it's

1855
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,639
not quite clear

1856
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:44,400
uh I think I added the same Library we

1857
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:49,760
just use a one color so such as at the

1858
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:56,280
isopers group we just use uh the same uh

1859
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:03,840
color uh for uh one parent uh

1860
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,600
policy

1861
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,400
but

1862
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:13,440
within the ASAP parent as a policy the

1863
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,960
different Services may have a different

1864
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:20,840
color so that it's similar to the

1865
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:24,840
hierarchical cues

1866
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:32,639
thank you

1867
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,139
thanks

1868
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:35,880
okay we'll move on to the next

1869
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,420
presentation

1870
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,760
hello

1871
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,300
can you hear me

1872
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,820
yes we can hear you go ahead

1873
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,179
oh okay thanks

1874
01:38:56,179 --> 01:38:58,920
good morning everyone this is William

1875
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:02,580
from China mobile I will present the

1876
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:05,699
draft networking Network resource

1877
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:08,719
programming with srv6

1878
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:12,440
next slides please

1879
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:21,320
uh they uh the consent of network

1880
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:25,820
resource petition is introduced in

1881
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:30,600
draft ITF test iitf Network slices

1882
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,679
as this script in section

1883
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:36,540
6.1 of that chart

1884
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:40,139
NRP is a collection of resource in the

1885
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:42,860
underlying Network

1886
01:39:43,219 --> 01:39:47,520
NLP consent consents of a subset of the

1887
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,960
buffer queuing scheduling resources on

1888
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,600
each of the connected set of links in

1889
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,639
the underlay Network

1890
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:59,420
and RFC

1891
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,440
8986 has defined a set of well-known

1892
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,900
srv6 and point behaviors

1893
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:10,500
but those behaviors are not associated

1894
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,560
with the set of NRP of the links for

1895
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:14,639
slices

1896
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,600
or slice aggregate

1897
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,679
so this document defines a new slv6 and

1898
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:26,040
point Behavior which can be used to

1899
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,460
associate with a set of NRP

1900
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:33,300
for example the dedicated skills

1901
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,440
resources or layer 2 logical sub

1902
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:43,620
interfaces uh we record and Dot NRP

1903
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:46,820
next slide please

1904
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,679
the uses of the end

1905
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,699
of the seed

1906
01:40:59,699 --> 01:41:03,300
uh this end touch and now PC is mainly

1907
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:06,840
used to steer traffic forwarding through

1908
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:09,360
the associated NRP

1909
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:14,159
by using the end.chana PC to build a

1910
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:18,560
segment list the srv6 policy have the

1911
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,960
capability to program network resources

1912
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:25,380
and restricted

1913
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:28,560
strict test SLA guarantees

1914
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,880
for one HP link multiple and Dot Channel

1915
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:37,619
BC should be allocated Each of which is

1916
01:41:37,619 --> 01:41:40,320
associated with a subset of Link

1917
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,420
resources

1918
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:46,020
in such as dedicated queues layer 2

1919
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:49,639
logical sub interfaces and so on

1920
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:54,900
let's see an example as shown in the

1921
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:58,139
picture one at

1922
01:41:58,139 --> 01:42:02,580
the for the P1 node the link resource

1923
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:10,519
from P1 to P1 has two and nrps one is

1924
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:16,679
gg100.q1 and another is g100.q2

1925
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:21,960
which are two dedicated cues on P1

1926
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,100
physical interface g100

1927
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,440
also uh two and Dot NRP seat

1928
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:37,638
s are allocated to those two nrps

1929
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:44,060
this means that for P1 note the

1930
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:49,260
end.netic a column one colon colon 11 is

1931
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:53,540
associated with an RP

1932
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,199
g100.q1 and indicates to forward traffic

1933
01:42:58,199 --> 01:43:03,179
to neighbor P1 where this NRP and the

1934
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:06,300
enter Channel visit a column one column

1935
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:09,860
column 22 is associated

1936
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:13,219
associated with NRP

1937
01:43:13,219 --> 01:43:17,219
g100.q2 and indicates to forward traffic

1938
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:22,400
to enable P1 where this NRP

1939
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:28,920
V6 policy uses the end.net PC to

1940
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,719
construct its path

1941
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,580
such an srv6 policy can provide strict

1942
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:39,600
SLA guarantees to customers

1943
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,980
next slide please

1944
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:49,860
this is the price processing of and

1945
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:52,280
started nappy Behavior

1946
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:56,040
the end thought behavior is a variable

1947
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:59,880
variant of Android X Behavior defined in

1948
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,760
IFC 8986

1949
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,760
any state instance of earned.nrp

1950
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:09,020
behavior is associated with two sets

1951
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:14,040
J1 and J2 G1 is one or more Elson

1952
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:19,080
adjacencies G2 is NRP of J1

1953
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,340
when

1954
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:23,159
and receives a packet that's that's

1955
01:44:23,159 --> 01:44:26,100
changed to S and the S is a local and

1956
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:30,179
dotted nappy seed the line is 15 of the

1957
01:44:30,179 --> 01:44:32,659
enter text processing

1958
01:44:32,659 --> 01:44:37,980
defined in FC 8986 is replaced by the

1959
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,060
following

1960
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,119
by the following

1961
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:46,320
submits the package to the IPv6 module

1962
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,900
for transmission to the new destination

1963
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:51,780
where a member of J1

1964
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:57,259
using the NLP identified by J2

1965
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:01,159
okay next slide please

1966
01:45:02,659 --> 01:45:06,960
this is a use case of the end of the

1967
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,440
nappy behavior in the srv6 list line

1968
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:12,179
celero

1969
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:15,239
uh in this use case there are two

1970
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:17,960
customers with different list line

1971
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:21,619
requirements from P1 to P2

1972
01:45:21,619 --> 01:45:26,280
one is a list line with 1G benchwise

1973
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,400
with strict as our guarantee and the

1974
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:33,719
other is this this line with two G

1975
01:45:33,719 --> 01:45:36,920
bandwidth restrict as our guarantee

1976
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:41,100
so the controller will build two SRV 6

1977
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:44,699
policies to meet the least line needs of

1978
01:45:44,699 --> 01:45:47,400
those two customers

1979
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:52,320
first it calculates srv6 policy paths

1980
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,719
based on SLA

1981
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,900
assuming that both paths are calculated

1982
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:02,360
as X1 X2 X3

1983
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:06,900
secondly the controller cooperates with

1984
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:09,960
the network nodes to complete NRP

1985
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:13,380
reservation and the end.net PC

1986
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:19,139
allocation along the SRV 6 policy paths

1987
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:23,940
um also now take note P1 as an example

1988
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:28,080
the two different tender piece such as

1989
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:31,800
two dedicated cues are partitioned from

1990
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,380
the network resources of the physical

1991
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:37,199
link X1

1992
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:41,280
and corresponding and Dot nappy seat is

1993
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:44,280
also assigned to each of those

1994
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:47,159
two and a piece

1995
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:52,739
the results as shown in the table one

1996
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,860
uh the seat a column one column column

1997
01:46:55,860 --> 01:47:00,659
11 is associated to an RPG one zero zero

1998
01:47:00,659 --> 01:47:04,199
Dot q1 and the seat the column column a

1999
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:07,199
column one color 22 is associated with

2000
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:09,119
lrpg one

2001
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:13,199
zero zero dot Q2

2002
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:17,239
next slide please please

2003
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:23,219
similarly the NRP reservation at the end

2004
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:26,880
odd and IPC allocation are completed on

2005
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,840
X1 X2 and X3 links

2006
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:34,440
uh finally the controller uses the

2007
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:37,739
corresponding and Totten rpsc's on link

2008
01:47:37,739 --> 01:47:42,600
X1 X2 and X3 to build the seed list of

2009
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,179
srv6 policy paths

2010
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:49,860
as shown in the picture too the pass for

2011
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:53,699
SRV 6 policy 1 is

2012
01:47:53,699 --> 01:47:57,980
a colon 1 colon colon 11.

2013
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:02,400
and and a column two column color 11 and

2014
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:06,920
a column three column color 11. which

2015
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:09,719
satisfies the requirements of the

2016
01:48:09,719 --> 01:48:11,159
customer one

2017
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:13,460
and the path of

2018
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:17,880
srv6 policy 2 satisfies the requirements

2019
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:22,739
of car customers to customers too

2020
01:48:22,739 --> 01:48:26,540
oh okay next slide

2021
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:32,900
next slide please okay

2022
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,840
in this use case the traffic from

2023
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:40,500
customer one will be forwarded to P2

2024
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:45,119
while the NRP previously resolved for

2025
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:49,320
the per hoplink on the srv6 policy one

2026
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:50,940
pass

2027
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:54,719
and the the pie providing customer one

2028
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,400
with and and head to end

2029
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:02,040
1gbenchwise resource for list line

2030
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:06,840
services with strict SLA guarantee

2031
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,820
next slide

2032
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:10,260
please

2033
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,219
okay that's all for my presentation any

2034
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:17,900
question or comments

2035
01:49:24,679 --> 01:49:27,480
thank you any any question of comment

2036
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,619
from the room

2037
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:31,619
just

2038
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,179
obviously I was wondering how do you how

2039
01:49:39,179 --> 01:49:41,159
are you napping the uh it seems like

2040
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:44,940
there's a mapping between the uh NRP I

2041
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,679
guess when the when the controller is

2042
01:49:46,679 --> 01:49:50,600
provisioning the uh flow I guess to qos

2043
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,820
because you mentioned queuing so I was

2044
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,800
just

2045
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:58,199
mapping that's happening as well as if

2046
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:00,480
you have if you have that let's say on

2047
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,159
the box you probably have your standard

2048
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:05,400
queuing set up but now there's a another

2049
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,860
layer of queuing that's set up with the

2050
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:10,080
uh with this programming and I just how

2051
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:14,659
that works because Ian are working today

2052
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,560
thank you

2053
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,980
okay that um I I try to answer your

2054
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:29,839
question so uh

2055
01:50:31,730 --> 01:50:33,739
[Music]

2056
01:50:33,739 --> 01:50:37,320
uh I would like to answer the question I

2057
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,840
I think it as you just mentioned the NRP

2058
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,080
maybe uh

2059
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:46,619
existing uh in the controller uh for the

2060
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:49,580
provisioning uh as well as

2061
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:55,560
how to attach the NRP to the forwarding

2062
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,300
leader is a question

2063
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:01,199
and uh it's very hard for controller to

2064
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:05,179
manage the dedicated

2065
01:51:05,179 --> 01:51:10,139
resource in the forwarding leader so uh

2066
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:14,040
combine the NRP in controller uh

2067
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:18,600
modeling and the the and the NRP

2068
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,060
Behavior

2069
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:25,320
it will uh to set up

2070
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:29,340
some good solution very simple uh you

2071
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:33,300
can use such as a service 6 policy and

2072
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:37,280
as well uh the dedicated

2073
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:41,580
resources in the uh forwarding leader

2074
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:43,400
can be attached

2075
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:48,360
it will help operators to support the

2076
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,739
high quality

2077
01:51:49,739 --> 01:51:51,300
uh

2078
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:55,020
list the line uh something like that

2079
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:58,199
thank you thank you maybe it sounds like

2080
01:51:58,199 --> 01:52:00,300
would it be like a layer of uh like a

2081
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:03,179
hierarchical qos almost I guess like you

2082
01:52:03,179 --> 01:52:06,560
have a layer of key OS per per NRP

2083
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:09,659
similar to like hierarchical qos thank

2084
01:52:09,659 --> 01:52:10,739
you

2085
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:13,879
thank you yeah

2086
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:16,500
thank you

2087
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,600
next present next on last presentation

2088
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,300
is a segment concouring procedures for

2089
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,280
Magical VPN service in Native IPv6

2090
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,179
Network

2091
01:52:24,179 --> 01:52:27,420
okay uh hello everyone from China

2092
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:31,380
Telecom and I will introduce our draft

2093
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:35,400
on behalf of the co-authors and next

2094
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,000
slide please

2095
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:49,080
uh yes we proposed this draft to define

2096
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,679
a new segment we call it endpoint and

2097
01:52:52,679 --> 01:52:55,460
VPN to contain the VPN custom

2098
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:00,239
informations and this segment can be

2099
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:02,940
used to distinguish traffic from

2100
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:06,199
different customers and

2101
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:08,480
it can

2102
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:12,020
unleash this segment of the

2103
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:16,320
VPN multi-group multicast Group address

2104
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,980
allocation can align with the unicast

2105
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:24,659
ipvpn address allocation and this the

2106
01:53:24,659 --> 01:53:28,320
the implementation of the solution is

2107
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:32,340
similar to realtor and VPN and it can

2108
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:36,179
also come compatible always a beer and

2109
01:53:36,179 --> 01:53:41,119
other Technologies and next slide please

2110
01:53:42,139 --> 01:53:46,500
uh yes uh one uh a customer wants to

2111
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:51,840
join the multicast group uh the ecosp uh

2112
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,639
is connected to uh will generate an

2113
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:59,880
endpoint and VPN according to the VPN

2114
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:03,540
custom information and send the segment

2115
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:08,040
to Ingress PE and increase P it will

2116
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:11,400
maintain a mapping table of endpoint and

2117
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:14,000
VPN and the European custom informations

2118
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,139
and the generated endpoint and VPN will

2119
01:54:19,139 --> 01:54:21,659
be inserted into the table

2120
01:54:21,659 --> 01:54:26,219
and when uh CE sends a multicast packet

2121
01:54:26,219 --> 01:54:29,520
to Ingress P the Ingress P will

2122
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,219
encapsulate the package with a header

2123
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:35,580
according to the endpoint NYPD mapping

2124
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:38,820
table and the destination address will

2125
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:42,840
be set to the endpoint I'm VPN but then

2126
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:46,619
the packet will be sent to the the

2127
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:49,619
responding request piece and the

2128
01:54:49,619 --> 01:54:54,000
behavior on P routers depends on the

2129
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,260
generation method of the multicast tree

2130
01:54:57,260 --> 01:55:00,239
and finally the egress P will

2131
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,840
decapsulate the package and transmit it

2132
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,260
to the corresponding C is a Nestle at

2133
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:07,550
least

2134
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:09,719
[Music]

2135
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,260
oh yes this is the encoding of uh

2136
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:17,400
endpoint mopn and it will come first to

2137
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:22,560
the IP wave 6 multicast address and the

2138
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:28,080
way defined uh an away bit uh

2139
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:32,880
over it defines a highest speed in ff1

2140
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:36,480
as the way bit which means the VPN

2141
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:39,540
multicast bit and when the speed is set

2142
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:43,320
it means the multicast group address is

2143
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,920
uh and a VPN segment

2144
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:50,340
otherwise it is a common multicast

2145
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:54,600
address and the network network prefix

2146
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:59,060
field will carry the customer's Rd value

2147
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:03,480
when the web it is Set uh addressed the

2148
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:06,119
information carried in this field should

2149
01:56:06,119 --> 01:56:10,280
be determined by the other base in ff1

2150
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:12,800
and the group ID

2151
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,540
carries the information of customer

2152
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:17,900
group Nestle please

2153
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,980
[Music]

2154
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:24,000
oh yes this is the generous generation

2155
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,679
procedure of uh endpoint type mypn when

2156
01:56:28,679 --> 01:56:32,940
an Ingress P generates the uh endpoint

2157
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:36,900
and VPN segment it will firstly extract

2158
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,500
Rd and multicast Group address of the

2159
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:45,060
customer and set the value of vb21 and

2160
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:48,780
set the value of a net Network prefix to

2161
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:52,219
the customer's Rd and

2162
01:56:52,219 --> 01:56:56,639
attend the Ingress P will set the value

2163
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:00,119
of group ID field according to the

2164
01:57:00,119 --> 01:57:01,280
customers

2165
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:04,320
multicast Group address if the address

2166
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,739
is iPhone 6

2167
01:57:06,739 --> 01:57:11,280
ipv4 the the value of group ID will be

2168
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:14,940
set to the ipu for a multicast group

2169
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:18,480
address and if the

2170
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,219
customers multi-group address is an ipoa

2171
01:57:23,219 --> 01:57:24,619
6 address

2172
01:57:24,619 --> 01:57:30,139
the egress P will check the P bit in the

2173
01:57:30,139 --> 01:57:34,800
address and if the p is equal to one

2174
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,580
the group ID will be set to the group ID

2175
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:40,580
in the customers

2176
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:44,520
multi-group address and otherwise the

2177
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:50,000
value of group ID will be set to and

2178
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,719
32-bit value that is hashed from the

2179
01:57:53,719 --> 01:57:58,380
customers multicast Group address a NASA

2180
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:00,619
please

2181
01:58:01,139 --> 01:58:04,020
oh yes this is a

2182
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:08,780
the behavior on the increase P when it

2183
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:12,840
received uh an happy way 6 package waste

2184
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:17,639
the destination address D and the D is

2185
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:21,540
associated with an uh endpoint of mvpn

2186
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:25,199
segment on the egress PE

2187
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:29,040
so the englishp will check the way bit

2188
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:33,480
in endpoint and VPN if we beat is equal

2189
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:38,639
to one it will look at the endpoint MP

2190
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:42,440
mopn mapping table according to

2191
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:47,820
the and and point and VPN value and find

2192
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:51,199
out the associated Rd and the related

2193
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:55,679
unfield table T then it will remove the

2194
01:58:55,679 --> 01:59:00,000
outer ipa6 header with all its extension

2195
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,540
headers and set the packets Associated

2196
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:08,520
and flip table 2T finally it will submit

2197
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:13,320
the package to the egress MVP lookup for

2198
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,679
transmission to the new multicast

2199
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:21,000
Downstream and if the wave a bit is

2200
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,139
equal to zero the Ingress P will set the

2201
01:59:25,139 --> 01:59:30,320
is associated I've made table to Global

2202
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:34,400
fmib and submit the package to the

2203
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:39,119
egress MF me lookup for transmission to

2204
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:42,780
the new multicast Downstream and next

2205
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:44,520
slide please

2206
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:47,880
oh yes and since since this is the first

2207
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:51,480
time for us to uh give the presentation

2208
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:54,800
of this draft Subway

2209
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,219
uh we hope we can

2210
01:59:59,219 --> 02:00:02,940
uh get some comments and or suggestions

2211
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:06,739
about it and we will reverse this draft

2212
02:00:06,739 --> 02:00:09,659
accordingly thank you

2213
02:00:09,659 --> 02:00:12,060
thank you one question did you ask a

2214
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:14,280
scrot that the best baseball team up did

2215
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,719
you ask for slot at the best working

2216
02:00:15,719 --> 02:00:18,440
group to present it uh

2217
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:23,520
uh at this time we don't apply the third

2218
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,159
time maybe it would be good to ask for

2219
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:27,960
to present for next meeting because it's

2220
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:31,320
heavy on VPN on multiplication

2221
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:35,639
uh yes uh maybe we will uh presentation

2222
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:42,080
it in next uh ITF meeting thank you

2223
02:00:46,139 --> 02:00:50,940
hi uh I'm Sasha Weinstein from riba uh

2224
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:53,280
I had looked at the draft before the

2225
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,840
president sure before the presentation

2226
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:57,540
and send an email to the authors and the

2227
02:00:57,540 --> 02:00:59,159
work group

2228
02:00:59,159 --> 02:01:02,520
it seems that the solution proposed in

2229
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:06,000
the draft only can work with Ingress

2230
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,219
replication as the provider tunneling

2231
02:01:08,219 --> 02:01:12,679
technology for mvpn because they

2232
02:01:12,679 --> 02:01:18,239
provide the structure of the end dot

2233
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:22,139
nvpn Sid includes the route

2234
02:01:22,139 --> 02:01:25,800
distinguisher of the multicast where if

2235
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:28,520
in the airspe

2236
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,659
rail distinguishers

2237
02:01:30,659 --> 02:01:34,800
uh in menu if not most cases are

2238
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,159
specific to each address P for instance

2239
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:40,800
if you use type 1 route distinguishers

2240
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:44,820
they would include the uh

2241
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:46,860
something like the router idea of the

2242
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:50,699
recipe is part of it and therefore in

2243
02:01:50,699 --> 02:01:52,980
order to work this proposal would

2244
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:56,159
require the Ingress fee to send a

2245
02:01:56,159 --> 02:02:00,360
dedicated packet uh to each address fee

2246
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:04,139
where the specific mvpn service is

2247
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:05,820
instantiated

2248
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:08,659
uh

2249
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,800
at the very least I think that this

2250
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,840
should be expressed if my understanding

2251
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,639
is correct I think that at the very

2252
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:16,440
least this should be explicitly

2253
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:19,020
specified in the draft

2254
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:21,840
if I have missed something I would

2255
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:25,400
really appreciate explanations

2256
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:29,659
yeah I I I think your uh

2257
02:02:29,659 --> 02:02:32,840
actually for for a podcast

2258
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:35,000
scenario the Rd

2259
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,280
of an artist value for all of the Eagles

2260
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:41,280
okay

2261
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:46,139
then the you know our job just uh

2262
02:02:46,139 --> 02:02:48,239
described

2263
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:52,679
for for matter of the engineer VPN for

2264
02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:54,900
the multicast services and my customers

2265
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:57,599
the marketplace audition must be the

2266
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:01,940
same for the market Services okay

2267
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,560
the text is definitely not what the uh

2268
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:13,199
normal uh mvpn Behavior suggests and

2269
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:16,020
uh in any case if you started from the

2270
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:18,420
unicast uh

2271
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:22,199
a VPN service that you wish to upgrade

2272
02:03:22,199 --> 02:03:23,300
to

2273
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:26,159
multicast VPN you don't change the route

2274
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:28,679
around around distinguishers but in any

2275
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:31,679
case if this is the Assumption of the

2276
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:35,699
draft it should be stated explicitly uh

2277
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:38,520
because uh I maybe I have missed it but

2278
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,199
I have not seen anything like that in

2279
02:03:40,199 --> 02:03:41,219
the text

2280
02:03:41,219 --> 02:03:45,900
normally in layer 3 in uh and that

2281
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:49,500
that's why I think that if you present

2282
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:52,860
is drafted at the best worker it

2283
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:54,840
definitely should be presented because

2284
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:58,800
it includes the bgp parts uh this the

2285
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,239
same question would be raised

2286
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:12,239
the Rd can be set differently or in your

2287
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:15,480
uniquely so I think we saw the Express

2288
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:19,099
in our draft or in our next practitioner

2289
02:04:19,099 --> 02:04:22,320
expressed as the Rd value of so to be

2290
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:26,719
same for the all the equality

2291
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:33,000
if you can have a short question please

2292
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,659
I sure I did just a quick question does

2293
02:04:36,659 --> 02:04:39,179
this uh draft does it follow like uh the

2294
02:04:39,179 --> 02:04:44,900
mvpn procedures RFC 6513 and 6514 uh

2295
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:48,000
using like Leaf ad to discover the

2296
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,400
endpoints like the auto Discovery piece

2297
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:53,639
or this is completely separate from any

2298
02:04:53,639 --> 02:04:57,300
uh nvpn procedures also I I do agree

2299
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:59,340
that this seems like it's more in line

2300
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:03,480
with like Ingress replication and uh not

2301
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:09,138
uh and not any other ptas thank you

2302
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:14,780
you can comment briefly

2303
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,920
hey John uh I think the kind of solution

2304
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,639
for the foreign

2305
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:30,979
[Music]

2306
02:05:44,219 --> 02:05:46,460
foreign

2307
02:05:47,239 --> 02:05:49,560
so thank you folks for all the

2308
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,239
presentations and for all the discussion

2309
02:05:51,239 --> 02:05:52,679
which is more important than the

2310
02:05:52,679 --> 02:05:54,540
presentation in many regards so thank

2311
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:56,760
you very much for your time we'll see

2312
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:59,599
you on the mailing list
