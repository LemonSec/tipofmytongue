[Music]

3
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,170
no problem

4
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,779
that's noisy

5
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:28,900
okay before we get started we need a

6
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:31,620
note-taker Thank You Robin appreciate

7
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:46,510
that and we need the jabber scribes

8
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:50,620
thank you so as always the note well is

9
00:02:46,510 --> 00:03:04,030
on the screen please make sure you

10
00:02:50,620 --> 00:03:09,820
follow all the rules we have a long list

11
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:13,540
of documents that are with the isg we

12
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,450
will mostly just hear nothing to report

13
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,579
about them but we want to touch base

14
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,220
with each of the authors to make sure

15
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:26,230
that any issues that have surfaced have

16
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,260
been addressed then we have one active

17
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,750
working group deliverable that has not

18
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,910
been sent to the is G and that's

19
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:39,520
regarding header protection so we'll

20
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:43,109
spend some time on that and then there's

21
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,610
some things that have been proposed for

22
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,710
reach our during and that is the going

23
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,720
to be the next topic we really dive into

24
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:57,070
so the the lightweight CMP profile

25
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,740
Hendrick couldn't be here but he's

26
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,049
planning to present this remotely so

27
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,860
we'll see how that goes

28
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,840
I do know that he ran a test at

29
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:13,870
everything worked fine during the tests

30
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:19,540
so it's as best as we can do but Murphy

31
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:22,780
lose and then if time allows we're going

32
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,669
to talk about two other proposals that

33
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,150
have not yet been talked much about on

34
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:34,919
the list one regarding update

35
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:38,940
to RRC 40 54 80 regarding the key usage

36
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:45,270
pieces and one about post quantum

37
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,270
composite signatures any agenda bashes

38
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:57,759
okay then let's go through this long

39
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:01,320
list of documents this with the is G is

40
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:07,210
that are there any open issues regarding

41
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,320
6844 bists I'm unaware of any but I just

42
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,310
want to make sure that if any surfaced

43
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,080
okay you gonna hit the button for Jacob

44
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,560
hi I'm just dreaming in say there are no

45
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:24,880
open issues with 6844 best super thank

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,919
you okay the next one is mine which is

47
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,130
the hash of root key certificate

48
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:35,859
extension we got a couple comments

49
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:39,930
non-blocking comments from romans review

50
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:44,830
i have shown him all the text for that

51
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:48,370
he pushed it forward to IETF last call

52
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:52,198
and so I'll deal with posting those

53
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:57,250
things that are in my edit buffer when I

54
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:01,479
deal with any ITF last call comments the

55
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:04,870
next two are P kick shake and CMS shakes

56
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,800
I don't know cleaner panels but there

57
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,800
are any open issues

58
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:23,060
um there have been many good review

59
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,750
comments and they're all being resolved

60
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:37,070
and the two documents are expected to be

61
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:39,560
to be done very soon okay so the I think

62
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:47,630
the documents were posted earlier today

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:49,700
right okay thank you yes over this room

64
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:59,030
and I mean they're a little more than

65
00:06:49,700 --> 00:07:05,900
done I mean you're yeah so they're not

66
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:08,390
done but sort of does right they don't

67
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:14,179
have our cm numbers yet fair enough

68
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:16,880
okay lamps CMS hash sig is in roughly

69
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,910
the same state as the the hash of Ricky

70
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:26,030
except that those are pending

71
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:28,850
basically we agreed on some solutions to

72
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,130
some comments from the ad review all

73
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:35,390
those were posted on the mail list and

74
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:40,550
then ITF last call has started right and

75
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:42,500
that's the same for the last two alright

76
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,400
so we've got a lot of stuff that's

77
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:50,990
getting very close to them okay any

78
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,400
questions about any of that good all

79
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,850
right so then we're moving on to header

80
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:04,770
protection I don't know if Alexia or

81
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:47,180
Bernie's pretty presenting a hat was

82
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:47,180
Burnie here's the clicker that was fast

83
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,140
[Music]

84
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:15,810
turn it on wake up okay my name is

85
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:18,270
Bernie who knows I'm here presenting the

86
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:23,219
head of protection requirements together

87
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:26,130
with Alexei we rolled up first zero zero

88
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,940
draft and you're going now through the

89
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:35,640
requirements part of this so basically

90
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,440
to put you where we are is EFS mine

91
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,529
since version 3.1 has a header

92
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,630
protection and functionality it's

93
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,790
somewhat specified as shown here in the

94
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,579
picture that you take the whole message

95
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,949
wrap it and put it to the content

96
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:52,140
because headers cannot be protected

97
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,480
normally but if you put it the content

98
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:00,240
it can be protected by either encryption

99
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:04,560
and each other or just a little so what

100
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,500
we did in the last weeks was to merge

101
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,439
two drafts that were out like there was

102
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,420
the draft lock the para protection to

103
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,420
just name the lucky draft

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,089
well it was like use-case and

105
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,010
requirements plus an implementation

106
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,260
description so we took from this pole

107
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,680
from this trophy took the use cases and

108
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,050
requirements and added the trough Melnik

109
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,770
inflames header protection which had

110
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,500
some real holes already going towards

111
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,750
solutions so the content is now we have

112
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,360
use cases we talked about interaction

113
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,860
cases and protection levels then there

114
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,200
are requirements and then these

115
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,750
additional considerations mainly taken

116
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,480
from Alexis elder draft that contains

117
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:58,060
possible solutions considerations for

118
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,640
the sending side and receiving side so

119
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,819
the goal of this meeting of this talk is

120
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,560
that we learn which protection levels

121
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,530
are in scope I will come back to later

122
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,849
what protection level means here and

123
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:14,089
reach requirements we are going to

124
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,260
address in lamps so set of requirements

125
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:21,380
made up may not be complete there may be

126
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,270
too many even and there certainly will

127
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:28,610
be some adjustments to the existing

128
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:30,920
requirements ok protection levels so we

129
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,160
see three cases like one is signature

130
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,650
and encryption like in our case we only

131
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,410
use this AC which end encryption nothing

132
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,120
else but there are other implementations

133
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,890
that use this signature only case

134
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,260
actually customer demanding this

135
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,380
obviously and we have the case

136
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,530
encryption only which we are not quite

137
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,820
sure whether it makes sense or melody

138
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,770
this is all relevant the head of

139
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,860
protection or whether it can be merge to

140
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:01,100
a we have discussion last year in lamps

141
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,380
it indicated we probably only need to

142
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,920
document it because it's not so relevant

143
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,870
in practice if you have however to say

144
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,939
something about this especially about

145
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:17,500
see you have a chance to go to the mic

146
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,500
we still going to the mic or going out

147
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:28,530
obviously to going out in the discussion

148
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:46,670
last year it was not a thank you from

149
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:46,670
the flight okay yeah yeah okay right

150
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:56,069
searched 105 replaced 104 so it was in

151
00:12:52,200 --> 00:13:03,960
practice last year last idea is there

152
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:06,210
anything like on the content of this now

153
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,850
if not we are probably going forward

154
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:12,510
with trying to avoid the encryption only

155
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:15,180
case in specification and documenting it

156
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:19,850
what would happen when you get one that

157
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:25,680
is only a cryptid sted fine

158
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:27,180
nobody seems to care okay I structured

159
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,640
requirements a big team general

160
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,530
requirements then sending site

161
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,900
requirements and receiving site

162
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,089
requirements and at the end I feel and

163
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,130
some backward compatibility requirements

164
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,640
so there are four slides that kind of

165
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,880
put requirements together so Alex I want

166
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,010
to say something just fine

167
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,760
you know we are not doing requirements

168
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:54,240
just for the sake of requirements is

169
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,890
some of the requirements are things that

170
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,080
we need to document in the final

171
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,110
solution document and other grounds

172
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,670
hopefully will help us decide between

173
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:07,640
couple of variants we're trying to pick

174
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:10,020
between so if people want to comment on

175
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,160
relative priority of requirements how

176
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,290
important they are

177
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,860
I'll bring up new things so please

178
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:21,870
please - so that's the sort of the

179
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:27,940
intent of this section okay thank you

180
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:30,010
so then ongoing Schalke Fruities but

181
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,779
maybe I asked before the question how

182
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,810
many of you have actually read the

183
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:44,170
drafts or the draft we are presenting

184
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:49,589
here hmm not many I start to think that

185
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:52,839
this discussion makes all sense yeah

186
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,130
okay probably just a short meeting what

187
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,630
you have to be aware that we're not

188
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:02,170
getting so much feedback on this anyways

189
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,449
so we have the one that it should be

190
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,660
fine a bit about the format about the

191
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:09,370
mime structure content type and so on

192
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,319
will not get you to what extent it needs

193
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,240
to be defined but it needs to be

194
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,040
something on it in the resolution space

195
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,959
to help the implementers to do the right

196
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,829
thing especially if there are plenty of

197
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,699
choices to use for example file name was

198
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:27,790
one thing that is kind of different used

199
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:29,800
so this is about that probably needs to

200
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,660
refined a bit more it should be easy

201
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,490
implementable so we don't want to make a

202
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,480
new whole new thing that this gets

203
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,579
rather complicated we see that there

204
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,709
should be if possible only want for

205
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:43,180
format for all protection levels so that

206
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:47,229
you do not have different formats

207
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:50,649
between encryption and signed versus

208
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,380
signed only and it should actually

209
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,240
mitigate many the middle and downgrade

210
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,069
attacks as good as possible

211
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,639
so these sort of all general

212
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:05,170
requirements if there is any comment in

213
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,550
the room it's not so many people write

214
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:11,680
the draft the silence is not

215
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:13,899
surprisingly coming okay not in here

216
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,000
then we have to send the requirements

217
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,389
basically in the signature case we need

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,899
to define which header fields we need to

219
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,790
protect with the signature then in the

220
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:28,769
encryption case we need to decide which

221
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,769
are events we need to send in clear and

222
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,660
whichever fields you you must not or

223
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,950
should not send in clear because we

224
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:44,079
follow kind

225
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:46,000
data minimization principles so that we

226
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,880
are not leaking too much what shouldn't

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,270
be leaked but this is probably only

228
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,070
shoot and also like there are some

229
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,870
special cases that are header fields

230
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,810
that we should not include in any header

231
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,790
protection part one case is the BCC

232
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:05,679
which is somewhat special so some

233
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,930
implementations it should get out so the

234
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,640
receive of a message should not get to

235
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:14,710
know who has been in the BCC but Alex I

236
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,250
found an interesting cases that the BCC

237
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:19,930
should be in he may elaborate on it yeah

238
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,930
I was trying to implement as my

239
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:25,210
encryption with BCC under depending how

240
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:28,900
you implemented you know there are

241
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:31,510
actually three kind of types of messages

242
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,150
if you are to NCC recipient you should

243
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,100
never see BCC right because they're

244
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,170
supposed to be secret from you if you

245
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,530
are one of BCC recipient you might get a

246
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:44,770
special copy which contain only us BCC

247
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:48,520
and this copy but it's a special version

248
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:51,760
of the message being sent out if you are

249
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,370
a sender of the message your sent mail

250
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,710
box might contain or be of all HCC

251
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:03,939
messages which is yet another version of

252
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:07,120
the message potentially I think maybe

253
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,460
BCC is quite special and complicated so

254
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,010
we probably should talk about it anyway

255
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:20,310
just open parameters so we talked about

256
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:27,430
this when we did our C 26:30

257
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:36,940
yeah 26:30 so which one is that that's

258
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:38,710
the first version of CMS and it's what

259
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,810
you just said is all very well

260
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,760
understood and I think explained in that

261
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,000
document and been carried forward in

262
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,080
subsequent versions Jim shaking his head

263
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,080
it wasn't carried forward

264
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,320
but the whole point is that you can't

265
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,310
walk through the recipient infos and

266
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,510
find out here at BCC is worth that's

267
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,570
that that's what you're trying to make

268
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,240
people think about what PCC is or they

269
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,800
can probably figure it out but I think

270
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,280
spelling out cases might be useful if

271
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,530
you have a can you send a message maybe

272
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,470
to me directly with the point and then

273
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,210
I'll have a look and then sure that

274
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,410
maybe there is nothing to do just point

275
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:23,900
to this document I know that email spec

276
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,790
itself also has a little blurb about BCC

277
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,370
would sort of try to describe but it

278
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:33,490
doesn't talk about encryption or signing

279
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,489
it also it's a little extension of

280
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:43,340
ginger I do I know that I read the

281
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,470
message drafts several times during the

282
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,570
last edit and I don't remember reading

283
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:52,460
this that doesn't mean it's not that I

284
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:58,370
don't remember going back way way way

285
00:19:52,460 --> 00:20:15,710
way deep in my mind I beg Li think that

286
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:18,919
when I so Jim that one way of not caring

287
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:21,470
is saying if it has BCC's I won't let

288
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,130
you do this now if you have ECC's

289
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:27,440
everybody's down oh so they were able to

290
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:32,450
determine it from those recipient infos

291
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:36,200
I think there are implementation choices

292
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,550
you can also never include BCC depends

293
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,210
how many messages you want to generate

294
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:43,520
so that it's actually very slightly

295
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:47,180
complicated interaction matrix it's

296
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,000
slightly complicated well no he gets

297
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:54,260
really confusing when you get a

298
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,340
non-delivery notice to figure out what

299
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,340
one it was about

300
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:09,919
seriously yeah you are not actually

301
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:13,040
controlling what those in this sent mail

302
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,820
folder but the SMTP submission code is

303
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:21,409
rust then you get I'm making copies of

304
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:25,399
the message education no you get one

305
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:28,280
plus one for each BCC that's right mmm

306
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,850
yes if you choose to implement it this

307
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,850
way yes exactly

308
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,260
do I take this discussion as indication

309
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,160
that there might be some interest in

310
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:49,070
actually throwing it out but please just

311
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,780
do do do some you need link maybe it's

312
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,610
already chaotic it's not covered what

313
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,700
the other one what the other document

314
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:59,840
says is you should generate one message

315
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:04,910
per BCC of one for all the rest yes

316
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,949
and so but yeah what it doesn't say if

317
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,520
the message is in your sample that can

318
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:13,400
be possibly another version of the

319
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,800
message which contains all BCC but only

320
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,480
in your son folder yes you can you could

321
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:29,360
you could collect them and only your son

322
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:39,860
folder into one message yes yep okay

323
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:41,840
some notice ahead of us so why is this

324
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,949
message displaying BCC to me I'm not

325
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,899
supposed to see it this way to trying it

326
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:52,850
out so I just went through the latest

327
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:54,950
message that's my bad the the term BCC

328
00:22:52,850 --> 00:23:03,350
occurs exactly once in the middle of a

329
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:05,420
live example wonderful okay I'll tell

330
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,530
any further comments to your central

331
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,390
grown-up someone is coming

332
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:16,330
do you time because I don't have to ask

333
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:20,590
this question this is the this is the

334
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:26,129
only chartered work on the agenda

335
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:26,129
[Laughter]

336
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,190
message - I don't care what the sign or

337
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,980
synchrony part I care about right right

338
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,650
so because when I encrypt a message in

339
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,020
s/mime I have the recipients list that's

340
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,510
right right and so if the recipients

341
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:46,180
list includes the VCCS then why bother a

342
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:52,120
BCC that's the morning that's why you

343
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:54,640
separate it yeah so then just screwed

344
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,959
right just make it all out there cuz if

345
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,960
you already you can already hear a

346
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,850
member they are so you don't care if you

347
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,460
have a separate message for each BCC

348
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:15,040
which is lower thing yes

349
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:20,230
ones one you have one for all correct

350
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:24,659
because the bcc's can't know about it so

351
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:28,660
in that case from a henna point of view

352
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:30,490
you can ignore it right you can in the

353
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:33,880
end a big message with all the legit

354
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,990
recipients the non BCC person fans you

355
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,000
can just handle the head of the way to

356
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,770
you ordinarily and just ignore the BCC

357
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,260
well sort of it's not that simple

358
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:48,010
because you don't want to generate a

359
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:51,760
message a copy for the twos and the CCS

360
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:56,020
for each BCC and so if that header stuff

361
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,390
gets looked at in the submit you end up

362
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,280
generating a bunch of stuff a bunch of

363
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:04,630
messages that go to the wrong people you

364
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:06,700
end up having to make a to each BCC has

365
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:10,990
to become a two in the subsequent

366
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:13,290
messages this is what Jim said this to

367
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,290
heart

368
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:26,189
don't get to see at all um that could be

369
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:28,350
some implementation advice nobody wants

370
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,690
to be bothered with a reply all

371
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:43,080
they'll just be CC everybody and so in

372
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:48,300
that case if you're doing it right no no

373
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:50,760
it's one of them once us is one message

374
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,440
to the to the mail list manager who then

375
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,040
oh you're assuming there's mail list

376
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,970
manager

377
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,040
well no mailman even right encrypting

378
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,860
look you're encrypting it for them and

379
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,920
they have their own keys right you can't

380
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:08,179
do that with the mail list manager

381
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:12,300
without an RFC

382
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:14,160
2634 mail list manager you hat you

383
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,450
otherwise you only have one address so

384
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,450
you can only generate one recipient

385
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:52,970
it seems a little yeah that's okay so

386
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:58,130
I'm channeling Sean Bennett comments

387
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:58,130
first what was that dark see that area

388
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:13,080
which time the mailers manager or the

389
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:16,320
other one are see 26:32 I believe it's

390
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,010
either two or the last agent is either a

391
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,010
two or three

392
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,600
you can consult it easy season if the

393
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,780
BCC is used the same certificate and

394
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,030
similarly you can eliminate the BCC if -

395
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:39,360
RCC and the BCC share the same

396
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:45,570
certificate sure it's not that far also

397
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:47,909
in the same also when you say is his CD

398
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,700
comes to what really is needed is that

399
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:54,930
PCC is included in the SMTP mail to

400
00:27:50,700 --> 00:28:02,760
command but it stays in BCC the RFC 5322

401
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:04,470
message Alexis is correct there's

402
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,900
another problem with actually Sydney

403
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,000
multiple messages which is all of a

404
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,830
sudden your messages I teased track

405
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,470
system you have no correlation between

406
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,850
messages at that point that would that

407
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,380
Jim that was my point about the

408
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:27,750
non-delivery notice because then you got

409
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:31,470
to figure out I think whether they kept

410
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:36,420
different or saying message ID it

411
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:39,690
depends on your implementation 50 it

412
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:43,050
depends on how submit works on your yeah

413
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:48,930
code yeah library so you know the

414
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:50,430
combination of the faults it okay any

415
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:53,430
other comments on that general

416
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,410
requirement section so for me the

417
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,400
summaries we need to look at PCC if it

418
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:05,990
more closely and to figure out that is

419
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:08,850
what XD that the proper idea is I think

420
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:12,600
probably important point from this slide

421
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,490
that I personally think that signing an

422
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,340
encryption case might be a bit different

423
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,410
about which headers you care about hmm

424
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:24,959
about encrypting while protecting or

425
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:27,540
protecting that's why I think it's

426
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,510
easier to look at young as two separate

427
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,330
cases that if there is any commonality

428
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,950
then it can

429
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:39,330
combined mmm so that refers to the

430
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,330
requirement of having the same format or

431
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:47,110
list of headers you care about to

432
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:54,689
protect yeah an encryption like all

433
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:55,959
right that's why I kept in the right

434
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:02,350
okay

435
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:05,260
so then we go to the okay receiver

436
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,590
requirements so what you found there was

437
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,900
basically if we have protected headers

438
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:13,510
and then you have the output unprotected

439
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,990
headers you have potentially two

440
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:19,060
different versions of headers and you

441
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,920
need to figure out what is paid and

442
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,300
usually just is paid in the inner ones

443
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,810
because the outer ones could be have

444
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,460
tempered with in any case it needs to be

445
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:30,820
documented then we need to found out

446
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:35,080
there are exceptions to this rule and

447
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,909
then it's again the same receiver needs

448
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:43,000
to be able to detect many the middle

449
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:45,180
attack or downgrade attacks well any

450
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,110
questions to the receiver requirements

451
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:53,470
guess there are more or less

452
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:55,389
straightforward so then we have they

453
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,640
called compatibly requirements there are

454
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:01,450
kind of two areas of requirements we

455
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,430
need to discuss like one is how to

456
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,680
distinguish between forwarded interrupt

457
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:09,340
messages that has to be the source of

458
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:13,050
many issues of displaying message that

459
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:16,689
some clients interpreted an encrypted

460
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:19,629
wrapped message as a forwarded message

461
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:24,520
and just enjoy it or like int allowed to

462
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,960
show it or let's say it was it was not

463
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,600
possible to actually look at it it was

464
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,440
just an attachment should we help these

465
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,939
clients to fix their implementations

466
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,740
because also like in the simple form of

467
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,030
the case is basically an issue if you

468
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:42,160
can't like read the follow the message

469
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:45,129
this kind of laundry needs to be one and

470
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,900
then we talk later about the rest

471
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:51,190
think alexei to say something about this

472
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:55,300
what I just mentioned yeah we when we

473
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:57,070
were discussing slides yesterday there

474
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,370
might be a variation of the first

475
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:06,250
requirement or sort of an extra

476
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:08,169
requirement about I really struggle how

477
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:18,790
to explain it I called it no weird

478
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:23,170
artifacts in UI production and one of

479
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:25,990
them cause we had side effects in an

480
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:28,960
extended clients that don't understand

481
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:35,110
it that might be a way of you know

482
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:40,270
possibly negative against this it is

483
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:43,030
very says maybe we should try to see how

484
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:44,650
many clients have broken disrespect if

485
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,980
the clients cannot handle nested

486
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:50,680
messages anyway they're already broken

487
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:52,270
maybe we should encourage them to be

488
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:58,510
fixed in the first place so maybe it's

489
00:32:52,270 --> 00:33:00,670
not a big deal Jim's like another thing

490
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,800
you have to distinguish in v1

491
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:06,600
I don't know such a thing exists but it

492
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:11,950
makes sense that it would if you had a

493
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:15,879
26:34 mailing list that topknot not gave

494
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:19,510
multi-part alternative at the top much

495
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,250
like with the but like the IETF says

496
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,370
where it says this was processed by this

497
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:31,390
name mailing lists and then being Crips

498
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:42,280
it not sure whether these feet still

499
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:42,850
linked to HIPAA protection yeah okay got

500
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,760
it

501
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:48,070
I think Jim is trying to say there's a

502
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,490
difference between forwarded and mail

503
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,980
lists processed no okay then I

504
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:58,460
misunderstood I'm saying this process

505
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:03,020
occurs it may put later which me yes

506
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:05,450
whose return oh no mind later so he may

507
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,970
actually put change the mind message

508
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,770
that is encrypted which makes the

509
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:13,630
distinction initially between for a

510
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:18,050
route messages a little bit part of

511
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:21,410
let's say off hmm that should fail and

512
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:24,080
what to do is be recharged encrypted

513
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:24,949
message right sort of it wraps it in a

514
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:32,239
different way

515
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:49,270
erotic part structure yes okay I think

516
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:53,929
you're still not communicated you know

517
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:55,969
that may not look the same whether you

518
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:59,210
forward messages or about message and be

519
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:04,459
one let me change that you're just here

520
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:12,380
that's not written about well and it may

521
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:13,930
break the signature beside it no that's

522
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,040
right

523
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,990
Marcus Trent foundation that we are

524
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,020
doing this message brokering approach

525
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:23,270
already with PGP and we're also serving

526
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,650
how this looks like in clients which

527
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,710
don't know anything about it in the

528
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:30,620
usual cases that it looks like you

529
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:34,460
receive a message for right by yourself

530
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:36,560
kind of and what we already gave is we

531
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,580
already added new proposition of formal

532
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,680
equals know so this could perhaps be way

533
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,310
forward for these cases but also the

534
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:49,009
memory role approach which we are

535
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:51,890
consuming it already - so we are like

536
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,840
trying to be interoperate with whatever

537
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:56,180
is out there in the end of course with

538
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:00,170
the preference is wrapping approach but

539
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:03,970
I think it's not that application

540
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:06,950
usually in in clients which can show

541
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:09,470
rock-rock messages and they get what is

542
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,240
that has at least one advantage is that

543
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:13,279
you can still see the headers

544
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,040
I mean you can at least see what the

545
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,530
subject was intended to be in the memory

546
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,290
roll approach you don't see that so this

547
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:24,470
you have always liked when features and

548
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:27,020
disadvantages so that would be like also

549
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:35,990
something to to look at how to deal with

550
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:38,509
that okay in a way it's artifact in the

551
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,819
UI but it's a useful artifact which is

552
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,860
sort of the soul of you know yeah I

553
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,960
think I understand what you and I can't

554
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,700
under Bert you if you have an method

555
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,980
message you can see some headers in the

556
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,569
nested message where in memory call

557
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,660
approach it wouldn't see it will just be

558
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:57,590
part of the main message a gigantic yeah

559
00:36:52,660 --> 00:37:01,129
sacred message or results in any mail

560
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,810
nowadays and if you cannot you cannot I

561
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,640
mean you have to open up you decrypt

562
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:07,880
your email manually and look for this

563
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,549
mind parts where the actual subject

564
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,070
stands and I think this might be for

565
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,580
normal users even a bigger issue than if

566
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:25,730
you stop by to eat what I mean yeah that

567
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:28,970
Rebecca was even further thinking about

568
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:32,150
this fault equals no propose of Alexei

569
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:35,149
we have also like forward equals yes and

570
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,400
we have forwarded something neutral or

571
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,930
nothing now for feeding we are getting

572
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,520
like of three different meanings of this

573
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,100
which is kind of beyond the head about

574
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,810
the actual thing but I think for today's

575
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,700
tell the client hate as a form of the

576
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:49,190
message handle it it's not just an

577
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,700
attachment nothing we don't know thing

578
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,950
about it or maybe it has the snowfall

579
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,160
other than no encrypted message it's

580
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,689
just an attachment ain't in the our case

581
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,509
would be for what recourse no which

582
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,970
means if an encrypted message is just

583
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,740
dropped so just something to think

584
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:11,180
further about the proposal we are making

585
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:13,879
up okay so any further comments to this

586
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:17,450
forward versus Rob messages or can you

587
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:23,060
go to the next thing which I'm just

588
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:24,660
doing is next for requirement PS one two

589
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:28,049
three and PR on this

590
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,450
is mainly about the negotiation

591
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:34,589
mechanism or like or indication of

592
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:36,240
support feature indication of support of

593
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:38,700
something and we are not quite sure

594
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,399
whether we need that but basic idea is

595
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:46,859
that a client can indicate that it

596
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:50,700
implements full support of this RFC to

597
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:53,819
be which you are now generating and the

598
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,160
receivers I conceded and tender and

599
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:58,589
possibly behave differently if he knows

600
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,250
the other side understands the full hata

601
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:02,430
protection it can behave differently

602
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,339
then

603
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:08,308
clients he doesn't know anything about

604
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:09,960
not sure whether this is needed but if

605
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:12,180
we have that then it means we need an

606
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,480
indication mechanism we need the

607
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:19,980
mechanism to figure out where the other

608
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,599
side is supporting it and we need a way

609
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,130
to figure out the subject header field

610
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,170
to be displayed to the use of unaware

611
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,569
clients and the receiving side we need

612
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,579
to detect for support of new header

613
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:31,049
protection probably the requirements

614
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,700
need to be cleaned up a bit but before

615
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:35,038
we probably need to have a discussion

616
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,319
whether we include that requirement or

617
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:47,430
not I'm not sure about that theory at

618
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:51,808
all needed any comments on this silence

619
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:59,129
in a room my perception is that people

620
00:39:51,809 --> 00:40:00,690
have nots I interpret the silence that

621
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,980
not too many people write the draft

622
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:06,329
oscilloscope before also okay while I'm

623
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:33,839
talking someone is going to the

624
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:36,529
microphone i'm alexi why are you staring

625
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,529
at the ceiling

626
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:43,819
no are you trying to understand what

627
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:48,500
what the comment was or see themselves

628
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:52,550
the concern is if you have two clients

629
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,410
running against the same I'm out and one

630
00:40:52,550 --> 00:41:12,230
of them can handle header protection in

631
00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:14,000
the other camps what do you son back but

632
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,400
it's the same minnow box as far as

633
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,700
design and this this is actually

634
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,950
somewhat more complicated in sense of in

635
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,689
case who want to distinguish that the

636
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,310
new had their perfection is different

637
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,290
from the old header protection and

638
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,350
different from I don't support header

639
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:35,930
protection you know no the point is it's

640
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:38,569
not yes or no the point is my laptop

641
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:50,359
does what my cellphone doesn't and I

642
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:51,710
read mail on both yep if we design and

643
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,510
drive I think it will still be

644
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,660
reasonable in all clients you will have

645
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:59,660
you know maybe you're not going to see

646
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:02,720
as much information or maybe it's going

647
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,180
to present the in out of the way but you

648
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,500
used to be able to do something with it

649
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,430
where in your client they will just

650
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:27,860
handled automatically so if we're

651
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:29,839
looking at your BS for number two at

652
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,040
this point I'm undecided how you know

653
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,500
whether when you'd like and you try to

654
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:38,840
feel saying you know I'm this deal shiny

655
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:42,350
for the perfection thing because on the

656
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:46,160
flip side there is you know there is a

657
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:47,390
mime mime header saying you know

658
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,730
question one zero

659
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,240
I think then ten at some point was that

660
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,619
would be more

661
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,729
four versions that it would never be

662
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:57,770
multiple versions so it's actually more

663
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:01,130
genetic versioning is not useful unless

664
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,119
we make a mistake and have to put it

665
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,040
together again

666
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:09,710
it might be useful to have this flags

667
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:13,310
over to me otherwise it's the money I

668
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:16,670
just wanted to say that even inside the

669
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:19,549
same male clients by instance it may

670
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:22,160
there is a mess because there are

671
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:24,589
different approaches off as a protection

672
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,700
and all of a sudden the software gets

673
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:30,980
leaked or you just receive like replied

674
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,720
to Todd stop don't and stuff like that

675
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:36,410
so it's it's really a mess which we

676
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:41,209
should even inside one client trying to

677
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:50,319
fix before talking of even more I think

678
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:54,859
it's a I think we're probably couldn't

679
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:56,630
solve the problem by fixing all all

680
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:59,390
evolved implementations by working

681
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,390
around a work around them I don't think

682
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:04,160
it's going to work but that's right I

683
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,560
think we should collect the issues we

684
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:11,210
see and see if there is any pattern and

685
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:17,859
maybe you know dr. implementers work out

686
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:21,410
well okay so for me it is like the

687
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:24,140
indication of support thing we could put

688
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,629
it like this that we only look at it if

689
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,940
we see coal after we have chosen a

690
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,470
solution because it kind of really

691
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,760
depends on the solution we are taking

692
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:36,859
and so probably should leave it in but

693
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,540
like degrade it to a way that it's not

694
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:48,848
the must so it's my feeling okay any

695
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:48,849
further comments so then the next steps

696
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:59,830
or any was it

697
00:44:54,350 --> 00:45:05,839
last side it's actually just a general

698
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:08,029
Turner I representing vinified here and

699
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,400
I have not read the draft but in

700
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,380
listening to this

701
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,370
how much consideration is being given to

702
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:18,980
usability today just signing and

703
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:21,799
encrypting for the regular user even

704
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:24,820
frankly for knowledgeable users is

705
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:30,770
complicated enough adding another level

706
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:33,590
so I'm just wondering in this process if

707
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:42,259
you're going to be giving some thought

708
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:44,750
to that or how things might be double so

709
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,640
the Elan is going to say something I can

710
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:49,310
turn on Marcus from the foundation I

711
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,330
mean I can talk for pretty surprised

712
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,980
what we are doing we are indicating like

713
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:58,460
if your message is private or not with

714
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:02,030
symbols and texts so we are somehow

715
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,860
taking us into consideration and of

716
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,900
course also showing that the rights of

717
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:09,140
check in the end to be that memorable

718
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:11,240
would be that path but as soon as we got

719
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,040
in interaction with other clients which

720
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:16,129
are not aware of these protocols and

721
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,440
things might get a little business I

722
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:20,510
mean of course you can still touch the

723
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,890
indicate is that the messages is secure

724
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:30,080
because it's because it's encrypted and

725
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:32,359
sign it or if you if you trusted other

726
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,690
peers and we show it to Greene so this

727
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:39,950
stuff cannot show we interact with like

728
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:42,140
classic PGP users or later on as my

729
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,799
muses which should be supported so we

730
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:48,710
have like a week's concept here but

731
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:51,110
that's ITF scope is not a question I

732
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:54,050
mean a static referee blog is consumed

733
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,730
and every weeks should look like or this

734
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:58,400
kind of in scope but I think not in

735
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:02,090
scope of this job here so we have like

736
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,740
offer areas where we are presenting this

737
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,260
this rating systems and these kind of

738
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:09,399
things

739
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:12,580
a gym shot with caveat that I'll

740
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,930
actually no longer working for anybody

741
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:19,440
who's doing the mail client at the time

742
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:21,520
I was doing that I would basically say

743
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,010
assuming that we actually have the back

744
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,190
as compatibility sufficiently well

745
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:34,359
solved the user doesn't even know it

746
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:36,630
I just automatically do it okay then

747
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:40,690
some comments from my side on these CX

748
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:43,500
considerations I'm pretty sure we are

749
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:48,220
not going to solve it here in lamps

750
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:51,460
yes previous speaker said I am convinced

751
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:53,618
that UX needs to be more taken into

752
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:57,280
consideration especially if it goes to

753
00:47:53,619 --> 00:48:01,470
privacy and security relevant things but

754
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:05,140
the ietf so far has not been keen on

755
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:07,509
including that but this may change or

756
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:11,890
may not or maybe if you want to make a

757
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:13,750
quaint alexey oh yeah I think it's not

758
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,950
idea of strength to talk about you guys

759
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:19,270
I would agree to that I think this is

760
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,939
understanding of this is changing and

761
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:25,840
it's not I personally find this

762
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,820
discussion to be useful you know whether

763
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,940
this is going to be a document or

764
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,680
separate document I don't know but I

765
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,410
think having discussions about what that

766
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,100
but better ways of representing the

767
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:41,350
itself as metaphors for both display on

768
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,180
the receiving side what level of

769
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,890
protection message you receive an on the

770
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:49,210
sending side you know what kind of

771
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:51,009
choices you know because like typical

772
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,260
clients provide you separate choice for

773
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,300
encryption for signing and you can do

774
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,430
encryption only messages and then it's

775
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,420
like well you generated one of these

776
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,600
what do you do with it

777
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:05,260
from where they are right again there

778
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,160
are duis are possible but you I saw for

779
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,160
doing this sort of thing

780
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,790
yeah okay I agree we can document

781
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,710
something in the head of protection but

782
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:19,320
the question goes beyond header

783
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:21,680
protection I would say even inside the

784
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,820
s/mime world or inside the email world

785
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,490
there would be a lot of more need for

786
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:30,570
that and I'm pretty sure the scope of

787
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:34,430
lamps in particular is work item is not

788
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:38,760
covering to solve that general problem

789
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:40,680
during I had just some talks about maybe

790
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,750
raise some discussions in the ITF

791
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,960
generally how to deal with the UX

792
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:51,210
problems and that may be copy coming

793
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:53,280
something in the near future that we

794
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:59,670
discussed in general how ITF should do

795
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:05,190
with this problem okay so then can

796
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:06,660
accepts so we need to get some kind of a

797
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,790
confirmation that pick out the

798
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:12,509
requirements right and the protection

799
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:15,060
level question right and so we are doing

800
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:20,070
a loop in the mailing list and hoping to

801
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:23,720
get to be more like feedback from more

802
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,720
people who have actually read the draft

803
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:28,709
so it's a bit more time to actually read

804
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,470
the draft before the feedback in that

805
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:37,020
case not sure how well that works on

806
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:40,290
this list anyways then once we have that

807
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,790
we try to reach out to the implementers

808
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:45,210
of clients and libraries to gain

809
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:49,950
feedback to probably get some advice on

810
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:53,450
how to go on both of these steps will

811
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:59,430
lead to an update of the requirements ID

812
00:50:53,450 --> 00:51:02,609
and once we have a pretty good shape of

813
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:04,890
requirements ID we start the solution ID

814
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:07,049
like this kind of addressing these

815
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:13,210
requirements and goes into the solution

816
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:18,060
space okay any questions

817
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:20,620
since you want to add some Felixia okay

818
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:25,390
so if you have some questions please

819
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:49,990
speak now doesn't seem to be the case

820
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:54,879
Thank You Henrik would you do there

821
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:56,979
put yourself in presenter mode do you

822
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:01,600
join the queue or whatever you do but

823
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:08,860
whatever you did when you practiced okay

824
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:12,450
so can everybody hear me yeah right okay

825
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:16,750
so I'm happy to give my presentation

826
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:21,029
remotely though I just want to give him

827
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:23,280
an update on what discussion took place

828
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:27,700
at IDF

829
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:33,070
104 in Prague and after that ruskin you

830
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:34,899
switch to the next slide so yeah this

831
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:40,630
this is more less the summaries though

832
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:42,670
we got discussion on whether cm changes

833
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:45,970
to the MP needs to be a standard track

834
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:51,310
RFC and therefore must be approved by

835
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:54,640
some working group and we we discussed

836
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:56,560
that the profiling and referencing on

837
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,009
the the CNP

838
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:04,350
RFC could either be an individual

839
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:08,700
contribution or working group item and

840
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:14,350
Stephanie's discussed with Jim on

841
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:19,149
societies working with meeting and the

842
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:20,980
conclusion was that the CMP profiling is

843
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:26,840
not that specific to constraint

844
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:30,020
environments and therefore they thought

845
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:32,690
topic is better located in lamps than in

846
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:36,980
ace yeah

847
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:40,220
anyhow lamps is kind of success of

848
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:43,970
keeping sexy and he was originated in NP

849
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:44,990
kick so that's what what we thought in

850
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:49,850
the beginning too

851
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:53,479
so still the goal today's to do this

852
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:57,770
work within the lamp school what I did

853
00:53:53,480 --> 00:54:01,450
in the last ITF meeting I came up with a

854
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:05,330
separate document on updates to CMP I

855
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:09,740
will even short introduction on what is

856
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:13,160
in there so it's a quite short draft and

857
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:19,580
I provide an update to the cmp profiling

858
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:23,480
the document and summary of what changes

859
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:26,240
are are there on the mailing list is

860
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:29,480
proposed the text for the reach our

861
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,149
Turing or as addition to genomics a

862
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:36,290
charter and we had some on discussion

863
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:40,160
and I will give a quick overview of that

864
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:44,960
discussion also so Russ can you switch

865
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:48,020
to the next slide so yeah this is the

866
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,750
the light white cmp profile document and

867
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,180
you see the name of the draft change

868
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:56,170
from industrial LCM paper over to 9

869
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:59,450
points MP profile this is mainly

870
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:03,580
reflecting the discussion that we are

871
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:07,339
not focusing to industrial use cases

872
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:11,420
only to you you must run cases are some

873
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:15,190
use cases of course important for us but

874
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:20,870
the profiling on cmp is more

875
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:26,050
multipurpose to have implementation of

876
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:32,690
multi-purpose use cases and to tailor

877
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:35,000
the variety of cmp features to implement

878
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:38,300
those multi-purpose use cases and that's

879
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,790
why we also decided to change the title

880
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,310
of the document

881
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,160
then I had some some discussion with

882
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:47,560
Tomas Gustafson on this Omid

883
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,910
conformation and and he said okay there

884
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,150
are a lot of use cases where

885
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:55,750
confirmation typically is not used or

886
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:59,350
not wanted and therefore he he asked

887
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:01,570
whether we could incorporate this Omid

888
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:07,299
confirmation feature into the standard

889
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:10,200
use case and I did so by adding this to

890
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:14,080
the standard had a specification and

891
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:17,259
therefore it can be can be used as as a

892
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:22,210
standard feature and I think this

893
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:25,660
addresses to Mars requirement quite

894
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:30,210
quite well the second the second part I

895
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:33,879
was working on was the - to change this

896
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:37,230
revocation use case revocation on behalf

897
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:40,510
of ment entity so revocation by some

898
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:43,300
management station and revoking an end

899
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:45,640
entity certificate from optional to

900
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,250
recommend it this was a feedback from

901
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:52,150
within my company that this is quite an

902
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:58,200
important use case and that it should be

903
00:56:52,150 --> 00:57:00,730
supported yeah and in doing this I also

904
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:05,879
completed a specification on the

905
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:10,080
revocation message of law also in

906
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:12,250
consequence to the focusing on

907
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:15,819
multi-purpose and and light white

908
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:20,910
profiling and to discussion also in the

909
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:24,460
8th group we remove these let's say

910
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:26,710
placeholder for a co-op based transport

911
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:31,540
and piggybacking off the MP messages

912
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:35,260
from the document and we think if

913
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:40,480
someone wants to to specify this we

914
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:44,710
should do it in a separate document okay

915
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,850
so are there any questions to the CMP

916
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,850
profiling document

917
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:59,279
no so I will continue to the update CMP

918
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:03,229
document so there are mainly two topics

919
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:06,660
addressed in this document the major

920
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:12,058
yeah reason why why having this document

921
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:16,499
is that we need envelope data instead of

922
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:19,969
encrypted values for protected delivery

923
00:58:16,499 --> 00:58:25,049
of centrally generated private keys and

924
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:29,279
we had some discussion with Jen on mail

925
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:33,839
on how to do that and he pointed us to

926
00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:39,449
this encrypted key the choice in the CRM

927
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:42,269
F document and yet in CRM F anyhow

928
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:47,069
surprisingly the encrypted value is

929
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:53,069
depreciated anyway in favor of envelope

930
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:55,410
data so I think it is yeah quite quite a

931
00:58:53,069 --> 00:59:00,509
good and important improvement for the

932
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:05,670
crypto agility to to open up cmp also

933
00:59:00,509 --> 00:59:08,670
for envelope data and yeah there is some

934
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:14,369
discussion going on in my company

935
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:18,749
whether just exchanging encrypted value

936
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:20,869
with an encrypted key is offices enough

937
00:59:18,749 --> 00:59:24,868
and and proper backward compatibility

938
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:28,739
but yeah I have a backup slide on on

939
00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:32,999
that and so I'm yeah happy to get any

940
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:37,859
feedback from other s1 experts so what

941
00:59:32,999 --> 00:59:44,249
the best way to do this so this is Russ

942
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:49,078
I have a question and it's why are you

943
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:51,959
just wrapping this as opposed to putting

944
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:55,249
a whole pkcs 8 package in there you know

945
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:58,739
the which and with the recent extension

946
00:59:55,249 --> 01:00:01,109
58 something that Shawn did it would

947
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:03,309
allow you to distribute the the public

948
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:05,259
key and the private key and

949
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:10,449
the algorithm identifiers and all that

950
01:00:05,259 --> 01:00:14,619
in one big wrapped thing okay I didn't

951
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:18,309
really looked into that document that

952
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:20,739
much I thought envelope data package is

953
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:24,400
quite straightforward for the protection

954
01:00:20,739 --> 01:00:28,390
of the private key part but yeah if

955
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:35,529
there are other proposals for reaching

956
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:47,288
this goal in 59 58 right is that right

957
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:49,929
Ron okay oh is that right yes but is it

958
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:57,249
just the private or the whole one

959
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:59,769
asymmetric so the public key is in the

960
01:00:57,249 --> 01:01:01,169
certificate anyhow oh yeah yeah I

961
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:04,279
understand that okay

962
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:04,280
[Music]

963
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,329
it's worth looking at okay

964
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:22,719
CMC does and we made the change to the

965
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:30,400
format for C and C but it was not picked

966
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:40,239
up by CMP I thought this was ancient

967
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:44,019
history CRM F pulled both CMR F we put

968
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:47,019
this into CRM L see him C picked up that

969
01:01:44,019 --> 01:01:48,669
change see him he did not oh so this is

970
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:54,569
just a lining yeah where's your second

971
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:59,408
thank you I was really surprised because

972
01:01:54,569 --> 01:02:02,499
were published synchronously and yeah so

973
01:01:59,409 --> 01:02:06,119
I didn't really get why that was not

974
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:10,629
adopted in CMP but yeah Jim as you just

975
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:15,489
explained and and that's wall as a the

976
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:17,529
goal of updates EMP to open up the

977
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:21,489
agility to have

978
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:26,049
also yeah in the first case protect

979
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:28,809
private key delivery with ECC key

980
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:41,349
material what is not possible with

981
01:02:28,809 --> 01:02:44,799
encrypted value yet okay so neck a

982
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:47,289
second point I also discussed with with

983
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:52,329
Jim little bit whether this is needed to

984
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:54,819
be in update cmp but i think it could be

985
01:02:52,329 --> 01:02:58,689
there if we have this document anyhow

986
01:02:54,819 --> 01:03:02,349
and this is introduction of an extended

987
01:02:58,689 --> 01:03:04,658
key usage for cmp service like

988
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:08,409
registration or certification authority

989
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:13,949
this is similar to to what has been done

990
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:18,579
and I think CNC also that was an a

991
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:23,909
comment from Martin Pino he said this

992
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:28,839
would be quite useful to better identify

993
01:03:23,909 --> 01:03:33,069
these authorities yeah so this is it

994
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:36,009
more or less at the moment so if there

995
01:03:33,069 --> 01:03:39,009
pops any any other important change to

996
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:41,799
CNP up during drafting the profiling

997
01:03:39,009 --> 01:03:46,569
document this could be added here but

998
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:50,169
right now I don't see really important

999
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:54,839
points there there could of course we

1000
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:59,368
spent quite some effort to do some

1001
01:03:54,839 --> 01:04:04,119
clarifications or wording improvements

1002
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:08,309
that we see useful but this can also be

1003
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:13,179
be clarified by the profiling document

1004
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:19,569
so are there any further comments on on

1005
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:23,309
the update cmp now I don't see any okay

1006
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:29,249
so we could switch to the next slide

1007
01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:29,249
this is on the recharter ring so

1008
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:37,710
this is a proposal I I sent on the on

1009
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:40,810
the mailing list we had quite some

1010
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:44,220
discussion back and forth several people

1011
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:48,790
involved and I think Russ you summarized

1012
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:52,919
the involvement and I copied that here

1013
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:56,740
so there are quite some people

1014
01:04:52,920 --> 01:05:00,340
supporting this there was panelist who

1015
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:03,399
did not support this and there are some

1016
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:07,150
people willing to to involve in

1017
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,490
reviewing and also implement and so I

1018
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:13,000
think it's quite some positive feedback

1019
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:15,189
and I would be happy to get this adopted

1020
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,400
to the working group and would like to

1021
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:25,540
to continue and speed up the work on the

1022
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:28,900
documents so anyone who did not speak on

1023
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:32,040
the mail list what to make comments

1024
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,040
about this juror text

1025
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:55,010
so ruin how do you want us to send this

1026
01:05:41,780 --> 01:06:03,130
to you so you have comments I'd like to

1027
01:05:55,010 --> 01:06:05,540
hear them before we send it to you so

1028
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:16,790
why don't I make it a practice just in

1029
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:21,230
here okay okay so we'll make it a pass

1030
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:23,420
and then and then submit okay this is an

1031
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:29,650
addition to the Charter he also posted

1032
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:31,700
some draft milestones to the mail list

1033
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,680
yeah a lot more concern about getting

1034
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,359
the scope right and then we can wrestle

1035
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,940
over how quickly we're gonna get it yeah

1036
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:45,290
exactly

1037
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:49,550
okay okay so that that was it from my

1038
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:54,829
site on the updates to the CNP work if

1039
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:57,440
there is time I could I would like to

1040
01:06:54,829 --> 01:07:00,140
follow up with a discussion on the

1041
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:03,950
crypto agility in the envelope data part

1042
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:06,890
so could could share the feedback I got

1043
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:10,730
from from other colleagues within my

1044
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:15,109
company but I'm also happy to do that

1045
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:20,750
of racket on the mailing list if we are

1046
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:26,140
tight with time in the meeting what do

1047
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:30,640
you think I'm working a one hour slot in

1048
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:33,069
it yeah I think we need to move on then

1049
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:37,730
because we have two more presentations

1050
01:07:33,069 --> 01:07:41,060
yeah so thank you for getting the chance

1051
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:44,800
to present this so I'm happy to get get

1052
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:47,089
feedback on yeah on the update CMP and

1053
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:50,850
especially the backward compatibility

1054
01:07:47,089 --> 01:07:54,720
issues with this change from

1055
01:07:50,850 --> 01:08:09,890
encrypted value - encrypted key okay

1056
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:09,890
thank you Shawn Turner Europe

1057
01:08:17,328 --> 01:08:23,549
hi Shawn Turner I have to give you some

1058
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:25,739
time back here um the last ITF meeting

1059
01:08:23,549 --> 01:08:28,049
my co-author came up to me and said hey

1060
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:30,209
you've got this great document RFC 54 80

1061
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:32,908
you know it came out of his pickax Tiger

1062
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:34,859
team to specify the key usages for

1063
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:36,509
elliptic curve you kind of didn't

1064
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:38,849
mention two of them what are we supposed

1065
01:08:36,509 --> 01:08:40,380
to do so I shot of mailing I shown the

1066
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:42,659
mail off to the man list and I got two

1067
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:44,190
different answers thought well clearly

1068
01:08:42,658 --> 01:08:48,710
it's time to write a draft to say what

1069
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:48,710
we think I ought to be Shawn why do you

1070
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:56,500
[Laughter]

1071
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:10,949
alright why are we here right so

1072
01:09:09,029 --> 01:09:12,480
basically I want to do a simple update

1073
01:09:10,948 --> 01:09:15,149
to fifty four eighty Section three to

1074
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:17,250
say what the requirements are qisas

1075
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:19,858
extensions in the subject public key for

1076
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:22,710
these three Fri DC public key ee c mq v

1077
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:24,569
ID e cv h to specify one so the two

1078
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:26,309
values are and that's all we're trying

1079
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:27,750
to do that's it I'm not trying to adopt

1080
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:31,489
anything else I want to care anybody

1081
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:33,839
else's water and quicken done next

1082
01:09:31,488 --> 01:09:36,118
so really all we're doing is say must

1083
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:37,618
not set these values so don't set them

1084
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:39,538
you don't for key insight from it and

1085
01:09:37,618 --> 01:09:42,448
data and cipher man don't set them for

1086
01:09:39,538 --> 01:09:46,139
high GC public key don't set them for C

1087
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:49,618
and Q v-nec th one thing about the way

1088
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:51,480
50 480 is written um I Dec public key is

1089
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:53,670
for unrestricted key since for e CD s

1090
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:54,959
keys that's that's what it says when is

1091
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:57,449
it for anything else that's up to you

1092
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,940
but this is only for these and so just

1093
01:09:57,449 --> 01:10:01,710
do that and that's it um there was some

1094
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:03,360
debate I think there are a couple people

1095
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:05,039
that like hey this isn't clear we should

1096
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,259
specify it it actually came up I think

1097
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,849
in Ryan's sleeve he said something on

1098
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,349
the list about hey this has been a

1099
01:10:08,849 --> 01:10:15,119
problem in the past so I think we should

1100
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:15,769
just go ahead and do this next so what

1101
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,829
am I here for

1102
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:21,829
so whopping three pages I love a pony

1103
01:10:18,829 --> 01:10:24,090
but if I can't get that I love just

1104
01:10:21,829 --> 01:10:25,500
adopt the draft working group last call

1105
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:27,659
and do whatever you do just pump this

1106
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:30,350
out it's three pages it's like eight

1107
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:32,059
lines of text really all I want to do is

1108
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:34,340
add a cup of those words basically don't

1109
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:35,840
must offer those things there anybody

1110
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:37,430
that thinks that this is a horrible idea

1111
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,560
and wants to get to the microphone and

1112
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:42,080
argue me into the ground for why we

1113
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:47,870
shouldn't leave this unspecified or not

1114
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:56,030
make it must bother Roman do we have to

1115
01:10:47,870 --> 01:11:00,200
recharter for this just run his AP

1116
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:11,059
process and it is clarifications 4p

1117
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:13,010
kicks argue that 54 ATK my IP kicks you

1118
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:14,120
know I just again I was the reason why I

1119
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,380
kind of put this up there for time

1120
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:22,580
allows because I understood the chart is

1121
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:29,650
written pretty narrowly the figures I

1122
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:33,050
think the charters specific the buckets

1123
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:35,960
but if this is so clear can i just--can

1124
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:38,320
so how about when we do the cmp charter

1125
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,750
we include a little wiggle room for

1126
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,840
clarification of previously adopted

1127
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:46,760
workers right and we can also ask and we

1128
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:53,660
can also have to rename lamps right just

1129
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:54,980
P kicks to or something now but again

1130
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:57,050
that's really that's really all the

1131
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:58,519
draft is so if anybody can tell me why

1132
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:00,770
it shouldn't be this way you're using

1133
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:03,650
he's already something that would change

1134
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:05,690
the what I think was the clear thing was

1135
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:08,900
to just say don't use them we could talk

1136
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:10,610
about what I would like to do is have a

1137
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,710
forcing function to have the Charter

1138
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:15,679
change to have his wage to do this again

1139
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:16,700
so so I'm sure so I am carrying your who

1140
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:21,870
are carrying

1141
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:21,870
[Laughter]

1142
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:28,809
it's a short drop so I just quit yeah

1143
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:33,460
I've got these two values that must not

1144
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:35,340
be present yeah well it depends on

1145
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:42,099
whether the extension is critical right

1146
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:43,510
that's right so my understanding is yeah

1147
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:45,400
if you used it for one of those purposes

1148
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:53,170
you can you pump it out I mean it's the

1149
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:58,150
typical processing rules right template

1150
01:12:53,170 --> 01:13:00,099
and the template using certificates and

1151
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:09,250
I'm still doing the same extension that

1152
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:12,810
they'd had so are you using templates

1153
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,810
that set these values is my question

1154
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,829
your previous employer I think that

1155
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:25,630
would be a good question but I would

1156
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:27,280
think that in the general internet case

1157
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:28,750
that people wouldn't really be setting

1158
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,889
these things because I think CAS or

1159
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,570
never selling them in the first place

1160
01:13:29,889 --> 01:13:36,130
and that's really what this comes down

1161
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:37,329
to you the sponsors good yeah yeah so

1162
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,590
cell sensors you can do whatever the

1163
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:40,150
heck you want right but I mean at the

1164
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:44,199
end of the day CA is probably weren't

1165
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:47,379
really setting these things Mac so you

1166
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:49,659
can order the mic or not it's alright

1167
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:53,550
great thank you very much I will yield

1168
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:57,309
the rest of my my fishs time thank you

1169
01:13:53,550 --> 01:14:00,340
all right so I think we have an action

1170
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:08,139
as chairs to compose some shorter text

1171
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:13,989
for clarifications to Esmail and PTX

1172
01:14:08,139 --> 01:14:21,880
documents right okay so which one of you

1173
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:23,500
two is presenting well folks was coming

1174
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,110
up I mean the reason again the reader as

1175
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,520
I grew through the Charter why need your

1176
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:29,409
did you some updates is the last tab

1177
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,679
where if it's reads in addition to the

1178
01:14:29,409 --> 01:14:32,509
Lance work

1179
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:35,480
the other updates to documents produced

1180
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:37,100
by cheap pica-x blah blah but we shall

1181
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:43,519
not adopt any of these potential items

1182
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:58,880
without know Steve Farrell put us on a

1183
01:14:43,520 --> 01:15:01,340
box you handed in the clicker hi my

1184
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,750
downs right so I'm gonna try and do this

1185
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:04,520
quickly I've got more slides than I

1186
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,719
maybe intend to go hearing death but

1187
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,690
we'll be in there for the archives

1188
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:12,290
difficult rule Mike Oh sir tunes

1189
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:13,909
microphone more better so this is post

1190
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:18,050
quantum this is trying to figure out how

1191
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:21,409
we use post quantum inside existing at

1192
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:24,830
self and ion CMS whatever it is you do

1193
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:26,059
with your crypto so what came out of

1194
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:28,040
sort of a lot of the academic

1195
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:29,600
conferences I've been to is that in the

1196
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,219
transition period to post quantum you

1197
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,370
don't know if RSA is broken you don't

1198
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:36,860
know if you're new whatever new thing

1199
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:38,599
you're using is is broken and just not

1200
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:40,909
announced yet so you really want to sign

1201
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,980
everything twice so picture in the

1202
01:15:40,909 --> 01:15:44,870
bottom corner there Alice sends to Bob

1203
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,400
Alice really wants to do two signatures

1204
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,960
on every document and send two

1205
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,639
signatures Bob wants to verify two

1206
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:52,340
signatures this is sort of the

1207
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,900
transition strategy and I've heard

1208
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:56,210
arguments that maybe this is going to be

1209
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:58,280
a long term strategy we don't know so we

1210
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:01,880
need some sort of mechanism to specify

1211
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:04,880
how this is gonna work we as a group and

1212
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,409
Trust data cards cisco i sarah max at

1213
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,320
cable labs we've been talking about this

1214
01:16:06,409 --> 01:16:11,150
for what almost two years now how do you

1215
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:14,360
do this mechanism in a way that's easy

1216
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:17,540
and transition safe and simple and yet

1217
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:20,540
yet yadda mmm um i sarah put in a draft

1218
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:22,239
Rusco ski year ago that was one kick at

1219
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:25,400
the can this is a second kick at the can

1220
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:28,099
what we're trying now is to say all

1221
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:31,159
right let's define a new algorithm that

1222
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:33,650
algorithm is composite the value of the

1223
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:36,920
algorithm is a list of public keys or a

1224
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:38,540
list of signatures in sn1 sequence and

1225
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:42,650
we're proposing that this is the

1226
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:45,610
simplest way to accomplish this multiple

1227
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:45,610
signature scheme

1228
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:53,390
how there's a huge bit of not said stuff

1229
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:56,750
they're like what if ones valid me

1230
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:58,430
others not yes okay correct

1231
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:00,440
I'm trying to vote slides not to be

1232
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:02,510
in-depth but to sort of so at this stage

1233
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,769
I think we'd like to make the world

1234
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:06,290
aware that we're trying to do this work

1235
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:08,060
and we'd like to get more feedback or

1236
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:11,240
people to leave the draft that we've put

1237
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:12,740
up and I don't know if we're gonna if

1238
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,849
we're ready to talk a little reach our

1239
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:15,889
Turing for the next laps

1240
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:18,350
I don't know how sort of mature we feel

1241
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:19,670
this is but we've done a couple years

1242
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:21,470
worth of work into this we'd like to get

1243
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:23,120
a bigger audience involved and exactly

1244
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,320
there's a lot of complexity that get

1245
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,240
swept under the rug here and I'd like it

1246
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,980
to get discussed and I think we've

1247
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:30,340
addressed and thought through most of it

1248
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:34,549
but more pairs of eyes please welcome

1249
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:36,920
so sir why do we do it generally

1250
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:38,360
simplicity you think we believe this is

1251
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,130
the simplest way to accomplish this we

1252
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:42,230
believe it just drops into existing

1253
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:44,840
protocols we believe that you don't need

1254
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:46,639
the protocol there to be aware if you if

1255
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:49,160
you define a new algorithm ID then it

1256
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:51,410
goes down to the library level the

1257
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,820
libraries is asked to verify a signature

1258
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:54,530
what's the algorithm the algorithm is

1259
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,509
composite this is all handled by the

1260
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:58,370
low-level crook the library your

1261
01:17:56,510 --> 01:18:01,340
protocol doesn't need to change we think

1262
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:03,410
it's simple there's a few security wins

1263
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,820
over sort of competing strategies for

1264
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:06,830
doing it on the gloss over if the

1265
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:10,219
details are there in the slides if you

1266
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:12,019
want to look them up the open design

1267
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:13,880
questions that Russ just alluded to

1268
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,910
there are a number of sort of big ones

1269
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:19,160
we've taken what we think are reasonable

1270
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:22,580
decisions having had you know lengthy

1271
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:25,490
debates among the authors yeah big

1272
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:26,809
chuckle from Scott but there are some

1273
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:28,010
questions I'm aware that they're big I'm

1274
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:30,650
aware that they need to be talked about

1275
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:32,150
and I welcome this discussion too right

1276
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:33,589
we haven't really bubbled it over into

1277
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:35,379
the mailing list yet but maybe I should

1278
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:38,840
start being more aggressive about that

1279
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:41,990
and so the first one I think is Russ's

1280
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,750
point is what do you do what does a

1281
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:46,370
verifier do if they receive say they

1282
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,200
received a document it has four

1283
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:51,769
signatures and they only recognize one

1284
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,210
of the algorithms what do you do or one

1285
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:55,070
of the algorithms is deprecated you know

1286
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:56,360
RSA is totally broken and you received

1287
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:57,259
something that's got three signatures or

1288
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,719
one of them's RSA

1289
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,429
how do you

1290
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:01,920
handle that case and there are

1291
01:18:59,429 --> 01:19:04,050
definitely reasonable cases in which are

1292
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,329
we signed with three algorithms because

1293
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:08,519
we want it to still be strong even after

1294
01:19:06,329 --> 01:19:10,829
RSA is broken that's sort of the whole

1295
01:19:08,519 --> 01:19:12,389
point of doing it but you need to define

1296
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:14,280
quite carefully how that behavior works

1297
01:19:12,389 --> 01:19:16,710
how the clients are going to allow

1298
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,539
themselves to continue verification even

1299
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:22,050
if one of the other things is broken

1300
01:19:18,539 --> 01:19:23,728
I think we've defined that fairly

1301
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:25,019
rigidly and I think it's I think we

1302
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:27,749
believe that what we have is a

1303
01:19:25,019 --> 01:19:29,249
water-type implementation but we admit

1304
01:19:27,749 --> 01:19:30,690
that there's it's sort of tricky to get

1305
01:19:29,249 --> 01:19:32,820
right and the algorithm is a little bit

1306
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:36,799
finicky so if there's a way to simplify

1307
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,799
that and tighten that more please do

1308
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:41,190
want to be open questions I think is

1309
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:43,710
straightforward key revocation if you if

1310
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:45,509
you declare if you contact your CA and

1311
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:47,340
say please revoke my key I think all of

1312
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:48,630
the component keys get revoked I think

1313
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,840
that's obvious I've been doing anything

1314
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:55,170
else leads to problems if you are

1315
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,090
submitting a CSR to a CA and one of your

1316
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:59,369
component keys was previously declared

1317
01:19:57,090 --> 01:20:03,210
revoked through some other thing you

1318
01:19:59,369 --> 01:20:04,799
know the CA point needs to do component

1319
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,300
wise checks against all other keys

1320
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:10,110
that's all that complicated it's hard to

1321
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:11,760
do right but I think I mean I think I

1322
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:17,009
think they sort of have to be this way

1323
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:27,210
Jim I'm having problems because I don't

1324
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:29,550
both keys maybe both so I'm not really

1325
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:31,979
too sure what you're saying so I'm

1326
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:35,400
referring to the cab forum requirement

1327
01:20:31,979 --> 01:20:37,110
that CAS can't issue a cert for a key

1328
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,929
that's before you vote maybe they that's

1329
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:46,889
a cab problem not an unknown IDF problem

1330
01:20:39,929 --> 01:20:50,329
fair enough I'm sorry I haven't read the

1331
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:52,139
draft so this is maybe very stupid but

1332
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:54,179
why do you do this

1333
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:56,940
why do you compose the signatures rather

1334
01:20:54,179 --> 01:21:00,510
than have new skills in the certificate

1335
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:06,058
that alternative signatures on the

1336
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:08,039
design certificate fair so the it's

1337
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:09,700
almost a question for extra dad I Sarah

1338
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:11,590
did a draft a couple years ago that was

1339
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:18,809
or along those lines adding an extension

1340
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:21,520
to the extensions maxi no final answer

1341
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:26,530
so yeah that was considered and actually

1342
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:29,110
has Daniela said they already work on an

1343
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:34,090
extension that actually carries the next

1344
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:36,940
signature they decided to go this way

1345
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:39,610
mostly because this is very online with

1346
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:42,669
how the way we process certificates etc

1347
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:45,309
and not only that and once you do a

1348
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:47,740
signature this way then you can extend

1349
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:51,010
this to use it in the every single time

1350
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:55,150
pick ax pepper structures from location

1351
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:57,730
to SP responses and everything fits well

1352
01:21:55,150 --> 01:22:01,839
without having to add extensions to all

1353
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:06,190
this protocol so defining this way

1354
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:07,960
it just needs it happen for my video or

1355
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:09,879
put a different way we don't want to

1356
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:12,610
have to open up every RFC ever to add a

1357
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:15,690
new field we're trying to use it it

1358
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:15,690
shouldn't very just go

1359
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:27,170
the last sort of open design question

1360
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,940
that we're still hotly debating within

1361
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:32,090
the author's group is key usages and

1362
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:34,429
extended key usages do they apply to all

1363
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:36,650
will they apply to all component keys so

1364
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:38,420
if you say this is a signing certificate

1365
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:41,240
do you have to only put signing keys in

1366
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:42,530
it people have numerous people are

1367
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,150
called us and said hey you could bring

1368
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:45,380
back do a usage search with this you

1369
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:47,599
could combine all sorts of stuff

1370
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:49,940
together and it turns out when you look

1371
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:53,360
at the details that gets really hard for

1372
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:54,500
a verifier to verify a signature if the

1373
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,389
public key that belongs to that

1374
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:59,480
signature is a mix of signing keys

1375
01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:01,910
diffie-hellman keys pure encryption keys

1376
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:04,790
and especially when you consider that

1377
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:07,280
the for example a lightweight verify or

1378
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:08,780
may not have implementations for a lot

1379
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,130
of stuff that may not recognize the

1380
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:12,259
OIG's and so how do you distinguish

1381
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:14,330
between an algorithm that you don't

1382
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,620
support and an algorithm that you're not

1383
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:18,200
supposed to support because it's not a

1384
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:20,180
signature algorithm and so the the

1385
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:22,400
verification Lodge becomes really really

1386
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:24,980
complicated if you allow mixed usages so

1387
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:27,500
we've decided to ban it then also we

1388
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:29,599
really didn't stop flirt flirt

1389
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:31,640
we also didn't want to get into details

1390
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:35,030
about how you do we actually do a

1391
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:38,080
composite encryption and if you little

1392
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:41,269
consider it can composite kill that gets

1393
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,880
to be a real that we didn't want to

1394
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:45,770
touch

1395
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,150
good plan so we tried we're trying to

1396
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:49,160
keep this as simple as possible being

1397
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:51,559
aware that this is already complicated

1398
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:58,309
in US and so if you tried to cut out as

1399
01:23:51,560 --> 01:24:01,460
much as possible sorry I'm going to be

1400
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:03,040
confused are you talking about who are

1401
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:07,250
you

1402
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:10,100
sorry are we talking about carry

1403
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:12,500
multiple public keys or just the typical

1404
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:18,770
signing keys for signing the certificate

1405
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:20,690
both both so we've defined the

1406
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:22,720
structures we've defined our multiple

1407
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:26,179
public keys or composite public keys and

1408
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:29,830
composite signature values so I think

1409
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:32,099
the answer is folks so so I would

1410
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:36,809
understand why

1411
01:24:32,099 --> 01:24:39,269
like multiple signatures but for me a

1412
01:24:36,809 --> 01:24:42,649
certificate is something that verifies

1413
01:24:39,269 --> 01:24:45,090
the owner of a key and when you

1414
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:46,949
introduce more keys my head starts

1415
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:49,800
spinning okay so think about think about

1416
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:52,499
it as you have a key you have a single

1417
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,090
key it happens to be composed of

1418
01:24:52,499 --> 01:24:58,320
multiple algorithms but that's not your

1419
01:24:54,090 --> 01:25:00,539
problem you have a key in a PEM file the

1420
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,398
inside making maybe more than one thing

1421
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:09,268
but it's still ace think of it as still

1422
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:11,340
as a single key so it's still can I

1423
01:25:09,269 --> 01:25:14,899
translate I think what you were trying

1424
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:19,979
to raise as an issue is the signature

1425
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:22,559
validation by the CA of CSR is different

1426
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:25,829
than the signature validation on that

1427
01:25:22,559 --> 01:25:28,409
document because the CA has to make sure

1428
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:30,449
you have the private key that

1429
01:25:28,409 --> 01:25:38,728
corresponds to every component within

1430
01:25:30,449 --> 01:25:40,648
the composite and also do what all the

1431
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:41,729
private key to public he checks that is

1432
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:44,449
he is required to do well there was

1433
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:46,199
possession yet

1434
01:25:44,449 --> 01:25:50,249
yeah

1435
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:52,879
can you say a few words about the Riyadh

1436
01:25:50,249 --> 01:25:55,139
one can you say a few words about the

1437
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:56,879
security guarantees that you have trying

1438
01:25:55,139 --> 01:25:59,159
to provide here it's not totally obvious

1439
01:25:56,879 --> 01:26:01,260
what the for example what the

1440
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:02,489
unfortunately property should be if I

1441
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:07,019
Forge one of the signatures have I

1442
01:26:02,489 --> 01:26:08,249
forged a certificate - sure I should

1443
01:26:07,019 --> 01:26:09,780
have done more introduction on these

1444
01:26:08,249 --> 01:26:11,219
slides sorry I assumed I was gonna have

1445
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:17,309
zero time in just but this yeah sorry I

1446
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:18,479
should have introduced better I I'm not

1447
01:26:17,309 --> 01:26:20,699
sure I totally understand your question

1448
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:24,389
so there are two signatures in the

1449
01:26:20,699 --> 01:26:26,898
composite signature yes yes it turns out

1450
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:29,129
tomorrow that Sphinx is broken yeah I

1451
01:26:26,899 --> 01:26:31,229
can forretress things to bitches now

1452
01:26:29,129 --> 01:26:33,269
yeah I can make a certificate that has

1453
01:26:31,229 --> 01:26:35,449
an invalid Aris a signature for the

1454
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:37,949
balance make signature is that valid

1455
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:40,228
alternatively can it be just small

1456
01:26:37,949 --> 01:26:41,308
distinct signature is that right so you

1457
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:43,889
should have to break all of them

1458
01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:47,610
breaking so so the verification

1459
01:26:43,889 --> 01:26:50,130
is almost verified you know mall that

1460
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:52,589
your verifier has libraries for must

1461
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:54,840
verify I see so that still means that

1462
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:57,570
yeah like breaking a single one breaks

1463
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,670
the certificate in the sense of

1464
01:26:57,570 --> 01:27:00,599
portability breaks the validity of this

1465
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:04,920
year to give a strip you will be

1466
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:07,770
rejected then the entire certificate is

1467
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:09,630
portable sorry

1468
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:11,100
let's forget affordable strongly for two

1469
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:12,300
bullet that so I can produce a second

1470
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,550
signature that's download on the same

1471
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:17,460
certificate so if any of them is not

1472
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:19,469
strongly unforgeable then the the whole

1473
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:21,360
certificate is not strongly unfortunate

1474
01:27:19,469 --> 01:27:22,980
you get this is like a you get a

1475
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:26,099
security property of the strongest

1476
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:27,750
signature or the most right the weakness

1477
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,369
of the weakest you get the certain

1478
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:33,300
security property the week is their

1479
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:34,650
their verified in parallel not series as

1480
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,300
well as that's okay that's fine but like

1481
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,940
we want strongly important certificates

1482
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:40,110
then this can't possibly give me

1483
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:41,610
assuming that any of the underlying

1484
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:45,540
algorithms couldn't possibly in the

1485
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:56,130
future become look good strongly maybe

1486
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:58,380
we should take why don't you get the

1487
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:59,969
most secure other than that things both

1488
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:12,030
in the certificate and then the real and

1489
01:27:59,969 --> 01:28:13,889
I don't think you can do better with

1490
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:17,190
that's relying party that doesn't

1491
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:42,540
support more secure but you don't know

1492
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:45,030
you don't know that's the boy so I made

1493
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:47,460
to generalize your comment if I can take

1494
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:50,340
a stab at generalizing way out I think

1495
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:51,929
we can agree that there we're putting a

1496
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:54,239
lot of security properties on the

1497
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:55,739
verifier the verifier has to be

1498
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,059
comfortable in what it supports the

1499
01:28:55,739 --> 01:28:58,469
verifier has to reject

1500
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,960
if it sees a lot of things that doesn't

1501
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:02,730
support their IQ turns it be having

1502
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:06,090
these strong policy on the side of the

1503
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:12,089
verifier is that does that cover your

1504
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:14,160
argument more or less in some cases we

1505
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:18,150
may lose security properties that we

1506
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:20,370
currently have on certificates going to

1507
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:23,009
this composite certificate and yes at

1508
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:27,180
least actually stated somewhere yeah and

1509
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:28,920
one one states one one one property

1510
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:31,830
particularly we lose as if if you have a

1511
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:34,290
single key ocula RSA certificate an RSA

1512
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:37,440
becomes deprecated your certificate is

1513
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:38,580
done gets revoked you implicitly gone we

1514
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:43,049
lose that robbed it for sure

1515
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:45,269
ha the save that will attack can be done

1516
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:47,840
with a single key celebrity right and if

1517
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:51,120
the algorithm is weak and you'll change

1518
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:53,580
signature that is rejected so from this

1519
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,410
point of view doesn't change the fact

1520
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:56,460
that if you change anything certificate

1521
01:29:55,410 --> 01:30:08,870
your new signature

1522
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:08,870
that's gets rejected of the microphones

1523
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:18,240
in some sense we have it right or you

1524
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:21,210
have fragmentation of the relying party

1525
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:23,370
community depending on what validations

1526
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:25,230
they perform something it's good

1527
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:31,260
something it's not considered needs to

1528
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:33,360
be allows you to say well I don't know

1529
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:35,010
about these algorithms yet or I know

1530
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:38,099
these but I do know when they are going

1531
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:41,310
to be broken so let me put multiple of

1532
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:44,130
these together so that you know today I

1533
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:46,560
can refine maybe one of them all of them

1534
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:48,990
but if I need to use the key to do

1535
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:51,900
signatures yes produce all the signals

1536
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:54,889
so I get your point and this is the part

1537
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,889
of the feedback that you know

1538
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:01,440
alternately used alternately the working

1539
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,390
group can decide to change the algorithm

1540
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,669
to say if there's any algorithms there

1541
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:15,420
you go support to rejected we get your

1542
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:21,800
signature Danielle yes Mike Jacobs are

1543
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:21,800
now and I say it seems somehow to see

1544
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:28,770
but it seems like in in order to make it

1545
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:43,170
easy on you know protocols dealing with

1546
01:31:28,770 --> 01:32:12,000
this certificate because it's going to

1547
01:31:43,170 --> 01:32:41,760
have to yes I trust library to get this

1548
01:32:12,000 --> 01:33:02,790
right more than the question it raises

1549
01:32:41,760 --> 01:33:09,000
for me is if you take that as right you

1550
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:11,190
know the question how many libraries

1551
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,020
aren't committing policy decisions

1552
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:14,969
certainly the major Kirk graphic letters

1553
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:18,270
wearing a self-balancing house was

1554
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:21,000
having the Mac OS implementation

1555
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:23,040
sobriety gear Chrome browser

1556
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,900
always to put their policy logic and the

1557
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:27,450
verifier he's doing there for

1558
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:31,710
verification largely response to sha-1

1559
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:33,510
and can get policy so the look is there

1560
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:35,370
that said there's a messy part of this

1561
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:38,370
we're separating this from the protocol

1562
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:41,309
layer creates new challenges which is

1563
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:43,110
the deprecation timelines have in some

1564
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:45,660
ways been coupled to the protocol or the

1565
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:48,269
use case that's being used more right or

1566
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:50,430
whether we want to talk about payment

1567
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:52,320
pci and you know continue if you like a

1568
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:54,240
shot one or we talked about whose line

1569
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:56,370
indicates case of Windows where

1570
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:57,860
Charlotte says ensures us to award the

1571
01:33:56,370 --> 01:34:00,269
case of OCSP signature verification

1572
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:02,009
where Shyamalan signature still live on

1573
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:03,980
despite the fact that they do not live

1574
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:06,630
on and x.509 certificate showing signs

1575
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:10,040
and so I'm not really sure that this

1576
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:12,240
gets us that clean separation because I

1577
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:13,740
create trying to put it in to verify

1578
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,200
relator is behind the central place with

1579
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:18,389
policy there's also there is an

1580
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:20,670
interplay of the protocol layer that if

1581
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:22,320
it is relevant and I'm not I'm not sure

1582
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:24,510
that this makes it any cleaner and

1583
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:26,250
therefore sort of agreeing with me I'm

1584
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:32,340
not really sure that we did the thing

1585
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:37,290
that we're trying to get so um

1586
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:40,050
Brian I would like to what I think you

1587
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:42,660
said but and I would just want I want to

1588
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:44,430
make sure is that you're not sure we got

1589
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:47,490
any better than having two signatures

1590
01:34:44,430 --> 01:35:00,660
and two certs right it's like did I get

1591
01:34:47,490 --> 01:35:03,450
that right okay thanks so the next panel

1592
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:06,300
turbulence um one of the consideration I

1593
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:09,300
don't remember exactly they comment

1594
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:11,730
there but um it was about do we protect

1595
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:14,670
against you know one two more other type

1596
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:17,849
of attacks right the idea here is that

1597
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:20,850
with this tool you can have your PGI to

1598
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:22,350
the point rhythms where some of the

1599
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:24,990
clients might not support all of that

1600
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:28,230
today and this is something that can

1601
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:30,300
happen for example devices in the field

1602
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:34,178
some of them you can update them some

1603
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:36,010
then cannot and in some cases

1604
01:35:34,179 --> 01:35:38,530
and one thing that I want to point out

1605
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:40,630
is that is usually the verifier right

1606
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:42,759
who's exceptionally certificate or not

1607
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:46,390
ultimately that takes the risk or not

1608
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,620
about do I trust this this information

1609
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:50,440
or not right

1610
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:52,420
once you verify all the crypto depending

1611
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:54,669
on your level of risk you might decide

1612
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:56,560
well I know that there's some possible

1613
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:59,170
compromises there but I still accept it

1614
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:00,580
or not this is a policy that is outside

1615
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:04,110
the crypto oxide list and this is

1616
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:08,590
specific for the application the device

1617
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:25,960
I wouldn't try to focus too much on that

1618
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:28,540
particular problem this gives you - to

1619
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:30,940
actually do - of today I can deploy

1620
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:34,150
something that I can verify in 20 years

1621
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:36,940
in streams or another protocol and you

1622
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:39,879
know still okay I can verify sing today

1623
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:41,860
and on that and I can take the risk and

1624
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:43,360
I can say you know I you know the other

1625
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:46,089
algorithms because they were broken now

1626
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:47,949
and I just trust that that is sufficient

1627
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:49,570
for me or I want to or time or I want

1628
01:36:47,949 --> 01:36:51,400
three of them so from this point of view

1629
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:53,139
actually it does gives you the

1630
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:55,629
protection today that you can rely on

1631
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:57,400
twenty years from my point of view for

1632
01:36:55,630 --> 01:36:59,830
example when I want to deploy something

1633
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:02,440
like yeah this is very important for me

1634
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:05,019
for CHF if it's mostly more than and

1635
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:07,120
then three certificates because I can

1636
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:10,179
because that chain needs to be valid for

1637
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:14,440
50 years or whatever number of years and

1638
01:37:10,179 --> 01:37:18,100
today I'm pretty sure is probably a

1639
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:20,980
stretch so but I don't know so I might

1640
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:25,320
rely on reading steel and be more

1641
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:28,718
efficient and or relying on the new ones

1642
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:30,719
yeah Tim Holly I think the one mistake

1643
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:33,940
the draft might currently make is

1644
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:36,550
prematurely specifying a verifier policy

1645
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:38,710
instead of saying here's a variety of

1646
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:40,480
verify our policies and here's what

1647
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:42,699
their security policies or properties

1648
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,620
are for example if you wanted something

1649
01:37:42,699 --> 01:37:46,269
that was strictly better than RSA you

1650
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:48,070
might choose a verifier property that

1651
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:51,520
says the RSA signature must

1652
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:53,380
100% be validated and then you know you

1653
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,060
get policy choices with respect to the

1654
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:57,280
additional signatures that you see and

1655
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:59,080
you may choose to you may choose to

1656
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,639
require that those if you're in a high

1657
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:03,160
security use case you may choose that

1658
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:04,750
those have to verify it as well I think

1659
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,800
the one thing that we do want to prevent

1660
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:12,010
is having people at the developer or

1661
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:14,170
protocol level having a entirely free

1662
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:17,200
and uninformed choice about what their

1663
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:19,510
verify policy is so I think it would be

1664
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:21,670
very smart to have a a list of a couple

1665
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:31,030
of good verified policies and what those

1666
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:36,010
security properties are okay I think

1667
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:37,750
we're out of time so so I think we will

1668
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:40,350
continue this discussion on the list

1669
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:40,350
thank you
