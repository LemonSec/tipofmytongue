from Boston University I'm fairly

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,710
certain I mispronounced her last name

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,380
because she's always been just on child

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,669
to me but as I turned to her I was like

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,259
oh I just realized I don't know how to

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,740
pronounce your last name but you can fix

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,459
admitted them personally but I'm sure

67
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:40,790
there are great people they have done a

68
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:44,060

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,620
working group session and we'll talk

76
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,150
about what working groups are and what

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,250
working group sessions are but you are

78
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,979
going to see this slide the sliders

79
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,329
basically it applies to all the ietf

80
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:13,819

81
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:17,449
participating in person or remotely

82
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:20,959

83
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:25,300
participants of the IETF agrees to abide

84
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,039
by the IETF policies on various topics I

85
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,800
don't expect you to read this whole

86
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:33,169
thing right now but it's important that

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,550
you read it before

88
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:39,349
any sort of participation at ITF this is

89
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,590
again the continuation of the ITF note

90
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:45,889
note well slide these are different

91
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,679
BCPs that is best contract current

92
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:52,879
practices documents which are the RFC's

93
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:57,319
and they have like details on several

94
00:04:52,879 --> 00:05:01,520
topics that ITF IETF has policies on and

95
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:05,029
that you as an ITF participant would

96
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,938
agree to abide by their is BC p4

97
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:10,550
standards processes working group

98
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:13,370
processes where the most of the work of

99
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,639
ITF happens then there are policies for

100
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,129
anti-harassment code of conduct patents

101
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,849
and copyright and then most recently

102
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:25,999
there is a BCP on privacy policy that is

103
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:28,599
about the end from that how ITF handles

104
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:32,089
all the information that you provide to

105
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:34,069
IDF so if you guys are interested in

106
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:41,899
that kind of thing you should go through

107
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:46,009
all these BCPs okay so here at IDF we

108
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:48,379
try to provide you with all the

109
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,689
necessary information and resources that

110
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:52,909
are necessary for you to get started for

111
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,589
this week and get integrated into the

112
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:57,139
community so there are a lot of

113
00:05:54,589 --> 00:06:01,759
newcomers activities that are organized

114
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:04,129
at every IETF meeting so before this

115
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,129
newcomers tutorial there were webinars

116
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:09,229
for the newcomers and today this is the

117
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:15,110
newcomers tutorial your hair it's from

118
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:17,719
12:30 to 1:30 the next newcomers event

119
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,919
is the IETF quick connections that's

120
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:23,439
also today at 4:00 p.m. it requires a

121
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,659
pre-registration

122
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,819
there's a newcomers ITF newcomers page

123
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,830
there's a link there you can go there

124
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:33,080
and register yourself it's a limited

125
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,830
space event so it's better that you

126
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,370
register early this event is basically

127
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:43,758
here you'll meet the ITF leadership so

128
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,279
you can have it's a very efficient way

129
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,129
to meet the working group chairs

130
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:56,229
directors mentors and other leaders

131
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:56,229
other weddings at the IETF and min yes

132
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:07,129
okay may be closed as I told it's a

133
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:12,079
limited space event so probably it's

134
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:24,229
full I think you can still probably go

135
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:30,559
that's fine trying to crash into it I'm

136
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:31,849
sure there is some way to get in so yeah

137
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,739
you can have short one-to-one

138
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:36,769
conversations with the experience right

139
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:39,438
here first there it will be a good start

140
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:41,749
of the week you can ask queries a few if

141
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:46,069
you are interested in certain specific

142
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:48,319
topic you can go ask them yeah it will

143
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,229
give you a good kickoff for the first

144
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,779
surviving the rest of the week um and

145
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,849
also it's not a formal event there will

146
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,860
be no speeches or presentations it's a

147
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:59,808
very laid-back and informal even there

148
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,569
will be beer there will be wine

149
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:06,759
there will be soda there will be some

150
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:09,860
snacks so I suggest you should go there

151
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,439
okay so this is in the evening today

152
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:17,569
then there is this ITF guides mentoring

153
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,489
program it it was known as ITF mentoring

154
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:23,449
program earlier but now it's in so

155
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:27,469
basically you're assigned guide I may I

156
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:29,319
know who how many people have a mentor

157
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:34,099
assigned already

158
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:35,509
okay very few people actually I would

159
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:40,129
suggest highly suggest that you should

160
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:44,000
go ask for a mentor that will help like

161
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:45,860
it's super easy to ask questions any

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,850
specific questions they will also guide

163
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,970
you and guide you through like tell you

164
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,009
all about ITF and guide you to how to

165
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,250
meet new people how to approach

166
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:59,899
different working groups working group

167
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,350
sessions how or like which working

168
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,550
groups

169
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,200
is happening when there are several

170
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,050
parallel tracks going on at the same

171
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,530
time and they can they can be very

172
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,620
useful for answering any questions so

173
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:17,120
you should have a guide assigned to

174
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:19,010
yourself then there is this newcomers

175
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,280
dinner it's not an official even it is

176
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,390
organized by a secretariat and you have

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,600
to pay

178
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,189
I guess 25 dollars for this dinner so if

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,950
you're interested you can register

180
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,050
yourself and pay for this dinner it's a

181
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,060
new comers only dinner it's also a

182
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,300
mingling even networking event you can

183
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,810
meet with IT Affairs and other newcomers

184
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,969
here then towards the end of the week

185
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,430
that is on Thursday we have an early

186
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,100
morning newcomers feedback session we

187
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,199
are really interested in knowing what

188
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,730
you feel about all these initiatives and

189
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,220
all these activities that we have

190
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,620
organized and how did it help or did not

191
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,510
help you get through the week how do you

192
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,700
feel about it and what are the other

193
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:06,590
things that you would like to include

194
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:08,450
and that would help newcomers so this is

195
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,090
really important and then as Karen

196
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:14,030
mentioned there is a survey form that we

197
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,840
would like you to fill up to get the

198
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:24,439
feedback all right so this is almost

199
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:26,330
about newcomers activities ok so now I'm

200
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,210
going to talk about the scope of this

201
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,040
tutorial like what you should and should

202
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,050
not expect from what we are going to

203
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,709
talk about today so this presentation

204
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,209
basically is focused on providing you

205
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,330
with the information and resources that

206
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,700
are immediately useful to you as you are

207
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,360
attending your first meeting it will

208
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,470
give you a kick of a start a good start

209
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,730
for the meeting for this entire week and

210
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,390
we will also talk about some of the

211
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,400
strategies to how to approach people and

212
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,420
make new connections or whether you're

213
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,209
well all of you are here in person so

214
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,829
yeah this is almost what we will talk

215
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:10,100
about in this meeting we'll also provide

216
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:13,279
some key some information about key

217
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,829
people and resources towards the two

218
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,379
the end of the presentation what this

219
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:22,189
present but this is not all about IETF

220
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:24,259
IIT F is much much broader than what we

221
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:26,089
are going to talk about today in this

222
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,490
tutorial so this presentation does not

223
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,860
really include I'm not going to talk

224
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,019
about the history of the IETF or how to

225
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,050
write standards documents and the

226
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:38,569
process of standardization and there are

227
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,209
several other things but we will but

228
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,469
there is this link to the YouTube

229
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:44,388
channel where you can find more

230
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:50,089
information about all this all these

231
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:54,920
topics ok in the next any any questions

232
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:56,899
so far ok so in this section now I'm

233
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,729
going to talk about a little bit about

234
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:06,139
what IETF is and it's related

235
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:09,499
organizations and processes so first off

236
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:11,870
what is the mission of IETF the mission

237
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:14,180
of the IETF is to make the internet work

238
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,790
better by producing high quality

239
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,209
relevant technical documents that

240
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:23,120
influence the way people design use and

241
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:25,699
manage the Internet so basically what we

242
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,870
are trying to do here is to develop and

243
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:32,449
maintain the standard technologies to

244
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,939
provide service and the internet so we

245
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,279
want to make sure we want to ensure that

246
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:41,740
the technology that we provide here at

247
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:44,329
IETF provides the necessary

248
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:49,009
functionality we also want to make sure

249
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:51,739
that the technology is easily and

250
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,480
efficiently deployable we also want this

251
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,929
technology we want to make sure that the

252
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,120
technology is scaleable at both

253
00:12:55,929 --> 00:13:01,519
deployment as well as the usage level

254
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,129
and you also want to make sure that the

255
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,769
technology that we deploy is secure in

256
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:10,670
itself as well as the at the operational

257
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:13,399
level so basically the mission of IETF

258
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,550
in a nutshell is to make the internet

259
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:20,139
work better by writing high quality

260
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,139
internet standards documents

261
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,770
so ietf it's a standards development

262
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,250
organization there are several other s

263
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:36,130
to use but ITF is different from these

264
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:37,990
as dio's in in a lot of aspects so IETF

265
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,830
is basically a voluntary based

266
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,620
organizations it organization it's us

267
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,810
it's a self selected individual

268
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,500
participation there is no formal

269
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,349
membership

270
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,840
unlike other st o--'s anybody can come

271
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:56,110
willingly and join and anybody can go

272
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:59,710
whenever they wish to another important

273
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:03,130
and very unique feature of ITF is that

274
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:06,250
to reach a consensus we do not follow a

275
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:09,370
formal voting procedure what we do

276
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,220
instead is a hum and we'll talk about it

277
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,560
later in this presentation

278
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,600
but unlike the important point here is

279
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,709
that unlike other standards organization

280
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,510
where voting is the main main a way of

281
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,920
reaching a consensus here we do not

282
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:29,620
believe in a formal voting process

283
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,000
additionally ITF does not has any formal

284
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,090
government or a government role or any

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,530
private corporations rule it's a very

286
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:43,060
individual based individual

287
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,949
participation based organization another

288
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,930
important and unique factor is that the

289
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,540
standards that we develop or write here

290
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:53,109
are not mandated we don't mandate

291
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,900
standards on people it's mostly the

292
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,090
standardization is mostly driven by

293
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:01,540
market-based adoption so if people think

294
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:04,570
that a standard technology is useful

295
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:08,099
they would read it they would deploy it

296
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,540
and see if it works and that's how a

297
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,670
specification becomes a standard when

298
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,150
people actually think that it is useful

299
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:18,370
and it is deployed so that's how it's

300
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,170
kind of a Bottoms Up approach as opposed

301
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,910
to going from standardization to

302
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,250
adoption we believe in going from

303
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:31,689
adoption to standardization so it's a

304
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:35,350
very market adoption based process at

305
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:37,330
ITF we are primarily focused on

306
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,850
improving the internet working on

307
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,740
internet technologies that is where the

308
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,570
focuses and that is where we think our

309
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,790
expertise is as opposed to other

310
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,320
organizations where where they are

311
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,280
involved with several other things like

312
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,590
other processes and parts of Internet

313
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,650
are improving the Internet but here at

314
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,210
ITF our core focuses on working on the

315
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,390
Internet technologies that provide

316
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,850
service and as I said this is a very

317
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,680
Bottoms Up approach as opposed to a

318
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:13,270
top-down approach which is really unique

319
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:15,520
compared to other stos all right so this

320
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,140
is really interesting if you're in here

321
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,150
for technology then you should

322
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,810
definitely look at these the slide and

323
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:25,780
dig deeper into all these areas so the

324
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,079
work of IETF is organized into working

325
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:32,500
groups the those are the workhorse of

326
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,500
IETF you can say and ITF groups these

327
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,070
working groups into these groups all

328
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:43,090
right so there are currently seven areas

329
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:47,050
broad areas and the working groups fall

330
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:50,620
under one of these areas these areas are

331
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,959
mostly dynamic we form one if we feel we

332
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,630
need another area and we can collapse

333
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:59,110
one if we don't need any more working

334
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,820
groups under that area so currently

335
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,190
there are these seven working groups

336
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,079
I'll not get into details of these

337
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,920
groups but the names are pretty

338
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:12,520
self-explanatory each of these areas

339
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:16,030
have one or two area directors who take

340
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,389
care of coordination between the working

341
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,220
groups that are a part of these areas

342
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,589
and see if they are performing the

343
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,050
necessary functions that are required

344
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,960
for a particular working group these

345
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,520
area directors are appointed by nan Kong

346
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,950
that is the nomination committee

347
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,760
typically for a period of two years so

348
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,860
the area directors take care of these

349
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,410
areas and then under these areas there

350
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,510
are working groups which are specific to

351
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,920
some specific problem that they are

352
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,780
trying to solve in the internet and

353
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,870
these working groups have chairs

354
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,180
who are present here in person and then

355
00:17:50,870 --> 00:18:01,459
they organized working groups at the

356
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:03,470
IETF okay so the IETF and consensus this

357
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,740
is a very very unique feature here at

358
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,860
IETF as I said IETF does not believe in

359
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,410
a majority rule philosophy so the IETF

360
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,590
mantra we reject Kings presidents and

361
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:19,340
voting we believe in rough consensus and

362
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,350
running code so how do we achieve rough

363
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,270
consensus as I said voting is one option

364
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,370
but that doesn't really resonate well

365
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,520
with the idea of at the mantra of IETF

366
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,699
and the people here so whenever on in a

367
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,220
working group session the working group

368
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,110
chair wants to know the temperature of

369
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,410
the room on a certain topic or how many

370
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,659
people agree to something or disagree

371
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,990
what they usually do is instead of a

372
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:50,260
show of hands or a voting process they

373
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:55,070
ask people in the room to hum like hmm

374
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:57,080
for or against a topic and when people

375
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,980
do that

376
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:07,240
the working group chair is responsible

377
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:10,970
for judging basically the the weight of

378
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,620
yes or no it doesn't tell anything

379
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:18,140
unequivocally like what is the real

380
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,179
decision but it just gives an idea of

381
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,130
where on the spectrum of completely

382
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,260
acceptable - completely unacceptable

383
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:29,150
people in the room are it's really

384
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:30,890
interesting so then yeah so then the

385
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,870
working group chair is responsible for

386
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,480
deciding whether we are going for or

387
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,659
against and it's not decided on this

388
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,880
part like this decision is then taking

389
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,770
this issue or topic is then taken over

390
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,930
to the mailing list and it has continued

391
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,520
there this is this is basically to

392
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:49,880
accommodate those people who could not

393
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,430
attend the who were not present there in

394
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,890
person and then the whole process not

395
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,740
the humming but the entire a discussion

396
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:02,649
is taken to the mailing list and

397
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:05,840
then we reach our judgment so that's

398
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:08,959
that's the way how we reach rough

399
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,759
consensus and there's this really

400
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,070
interesting if you're interested you

401
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,559
should go read RFC seven to eight to

402
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,779
that describes whole history of why we

403
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,149
follow and how it all started

404
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,909
the humming process another important

405
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:26,620
thing is that about rough consensus is

406
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:29,139
that everybody's voice is heard and

407
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,969
addressed but not necessarily

408
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:34,908
accommodated so not one person's

409
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:42,639
dissenting opinion can control reaching

410
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:45,049
us a judgement it's a rough consensus ok

411
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:49,100
let's talk a little bit about ITF

412
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:52,370
culture as I said it's a very it's an

413
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,649
individual voluntary based participation

414
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,408
so the people who are here are very very

415
00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:00,139
passionate and they are motivated and

416
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:02,629
self driven they're smart people they

417
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:05,240
are very vocal about their opinions so

418
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:08,269
if you hear people in the hallway

419
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,950
yelling at each other don't get scared

420
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:13,750
it's just the way they are they are

421
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:16,879
trying to reach reach a good solution

422
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,980
trying to hear each other also I should

423
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:21,139
keep in mind that these people some of

424
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,450
these people I have been coming to these

425
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,740
IITs for like last 20 years they know

426
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,659
each other really well they know how to

427
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,330
talk to each other they know their ways

428
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,889
so don't get scared of if you are if you

429
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,809
want to if you are interested in talking

430
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:36,519
to someone just go there introduce

431
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,960
yourself talk to them it'll be all fine

432
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:39,379
you'll be accommodated don't worry about

433
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,570
it

434
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:43,699
another thing is technical technical

435
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:45,500
excellence and topical knowledge is

436
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,639
highly valued so I would suggest if you

437
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,190
are attending some working group

438
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:52,758
sessions make sure that you have read

439
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:55,610
the relevant documents and if you say

440
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,110
something smart and technical people

441
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,879
would you know you you'll be

442
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:05,059
accommodated you'll be you'll be heard

443
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:08,149
and that says a lot about ITF culture we

444
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:12,980
are very it's it's it's pretty informal

445
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:15,018
like it's very friendly just like ITF

446
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,840
culture the dress code is also very

447
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:21,049
informal people mostly here like to wear

448
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,240
t-shirts well I mean a little bit of

449
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,269
formal attire here today that's not how

450
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,370
I am normally but if that's your way go

451
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:31,519
for it whatever you want to do you wanna

452
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:36,500
wear informal formal it's all acceptable

453
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:37,970
there yeah and as I said people have

454
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,919
been coming here for a very long time

455
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,870
they have close working relationships

456
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,210
with each other and people know each

457
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,559
other very well at both personal as well

458
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:54,490
as professional level so it's a very

459
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:57,860
very friendly environment okay this is

460
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:01,039
yes this is interesting so as a newcomer

461
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:04,250
here in this week you are going to get a

462
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,470
lot of acronyms I would suggest do not

463
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,269
pay attention too much attention to all

464
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,510
of them a little bit is fine if you are

465
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:13,429
working if you are interested in mostly

466
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,679
interested in the technical thing the

467
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:18,340
slide previous slide on the technical

468
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,340
areas you should dig deeper into it and

469
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:25,039
these these will will get these

470
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:27,199
different working and moving parts of

471
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,639
IETF that makes this entire organization

472
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,369
work gradually as you start attending

473
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:38,539
more meetings and getting more involved

474
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:41,769
in the administrative stuff but just to

475
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:44,840
give you an overview about different

476
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:48,440
different moving parts of IETF there are

477
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:53,080
several groups the first one here is

478
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,759
iesg internet Engineering steering group

479
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,309
this group is basically for the

480
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:03,169
technical administration of the IETF

481
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:06,830
it is also the one finally approves the

482
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:12,559
specifications to becoming the RFC

483
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:16,689
standards then there is IRT F internet

484
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,840
research task force this organization is

485
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:23,140
this group is basically focused on

486
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,870
longer term research areas research

487
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,600
topics in the internet as opposed to its

488
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,539
parallel organization ITF which is

489
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,408
focused more on the immediate

490
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:35,559
engineering and standardization

491
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:38,140
processes so I RTF is more research

492
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:40,299
long-term research focused groups for

493
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,270
instance there is CFR G group that is

494
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:45,610
the crypto forum research group that

495
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:48,158
provide guidelines on the adoption of

496
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:50,350
emerging crypto technologies then there

497
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,679
is really interesting HPRC which is the

498
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:57,658
HR PC that's human rights protocol

499
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,580
consideration group which considers how

500
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:05,820
standards and protocols that we develop

501
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:09,039
here could could enable strengthen or

502
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:11,408
weaken human rights if you are

503
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,510
interested in that kind of stuff you

504
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,789
should go attend I think the meeting is

505
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,320
on Friday it's really interesting and

506
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:21,429
apart from these there are several other

507
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,740
research groups that are not all of the

508
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:27,990
research group meetings happen every

509
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:31,919
IETF but a few of subset of them sure

510
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,490
happen at different IETF meetings

511
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,770
throughout the year

512
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,980
then there is this internet architecture

513
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:42,429
board that provides an oversight for the

514
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:46,740
technical technical requirements of the

515
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:52,980
end of the internet so they are also

516
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:55,240
involved in writing RFC's and standards

517
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,510
the internet architecture board recently

518
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,850
there was a workshop organized by I'm

519
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:08,350
not sure if it was organized by Ivy via

520
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:12,178
web packaging yes yeah so yeah there was

521
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:16,480
this packaging workshop organized by IAB

522
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:18,100
and the IETF LLC as the name suggests

523
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,380
it's mostly involved with the

524
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:25,620
administrative and management work at

525
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:28,899
ITF you can read more about it there are

526
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,040
resources available if you're interested

527
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,679
in getting

528
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:37,000
more insight into how the administration

529
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:43,060
of IETF works but for now don't get lost

530
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,320
into this alphabet soup okay so this was

531
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:51,929
the slide that I was talking about

532
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,929
basically well thank you

533
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:01,080
okay I'm gonna talk about the week that

534
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:05,100
started yesterday continuing through

535
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:10,260
today and running until Friday this is

536
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:12,899
sort of the most pragmatic advice the

537
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:16,379
agenda if you've already stirred you've

538
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,930
gotten a copy either you know links on

539
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:24,680
links online to be agenda there is also

540
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:24,680
an agenda app for Android and iPhone

541
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,840
sometimes they have little printouts and

542
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,500
fan-fold paper that are worth doing

543
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,629
they're about a hundred and thirty

544
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,480
working groups in the ITF as an Tom

545
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:39,020
mentioned they are the unit of work

546
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,460
within the ITF the people that do things

547
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,129
about eighty of them were meeting this

548
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,500
week there's also what's called birds of

549
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,330
a feather from the English or American

550
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,010
phrase birds of a feather flock together

551
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:55,290
meeting like-minded individuals and

552
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,150
these this is the step before an actual

553
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,530
working group is formed so there'll be

554
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,000
announcements and there are

555
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,830
announcements and things are in the

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,360
agenda about buffs for various topics

557
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:09,629
they may be it's called working group

558
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,939
forming meaning meaning the intent is we

559
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,410
want to end up with a working group that

560
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,540
then has to get approved by the area

561
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,770
directors or we just want to get

562
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,680
together and see if there's interest

563
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:23,400
they both might meet once or twice for

564
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:26,130
example an hour w/o the IRT F is meeting

565
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,290
also there's about fifteen sessions it's

566
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:31,050
actually you can consider it to be part

567
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:34,980
of the IETF meetings they're in the

568
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:38,700
agenda you can just go and show up there

569
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,780
a lot of the terminology and workflow is

570
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,790
very similar

571
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,590
instead of talking about a working group

572
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,040
there's a research group instead of

573
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:50,699
talking about an internet draft or an

574
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,620
RFC there's research documents as I'll

575
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,780
mention some of them are very focused on

576
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,629
sort of being the advanced R&D group of

577
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:01,560
the IETF and some are focused on being

578
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:03,120
more social oriented there's one for

579
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,120
example the largest-scale what I know of

580
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,820
is called global access to the Internet

581
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,189
for all

582
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:13,418
Gaia how do we get the Internet

583
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:16,210
everywhere there's the applied

584
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:19,389
networking research group this is an

585
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,799
eighth ACM affiliated organization it's

586
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:22,840
meeting all day tomorrow

587
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,210
I think registration is still open for

588
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,889
that it obviously conflicts with working

589
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,100
group meetings that are tomorrow like

590
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:32,549
two that I'm chairing so I can't go

591
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,110
unfortunately there is also plenary x'

592
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:37,059
two this year one right after the other

593
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,668
a technical one and the administrative

594
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:40,418
one the paper-pushing there's an invited

595
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:43,059
lunch talks

596
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:44,889
there's the tutorial program which

597
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,779
you're part of here there's a follow-on

598
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:49,750
another tutorial about how to write

599
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:52,440
security considerations about 30 minutes

600
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:55,480
after this one there's a social event

601
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,250
there's a mailing list for IETF 105

602
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,490
attendees you're probably when you

603
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:03,370
register you may have signed up or not

604
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:06,190
signed up for that list one of the most

605
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,250
common uses of the mailing list is hey

606
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,830
does anybody have a spare social ticket

607
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:14,049
especially as it gets close to the event

608
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:16,990
there's a hot RFC which is requests for

609
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:19,840
comments or rest requests for

610
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,220
conversation this is people say well I

611
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,289
don't even know if this is a working

612
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,820
group idea but here is you know some

613
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,080
research that I've been working on or

614
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,059
something I've been thinking about they

615
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,340
talk for ten minutes and see maybe

616
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:33,370
there's interest I've had a number of

617
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:36,009
people I volunteered them from the hot

618
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:39,309
RFC to come talk it's a acne or other

619
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:41,889
working groups we're trying an

620
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:44,110
experiment with this meeting the first

621
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:46,870
hour of every day is set aside for side

622
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:49,240
meetings one of those I guess is the

623
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,158
newcomers debriefing well though that's

624
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,419
before the side meeting just to get

625
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:57,970
together and talk with people that

626
00:30:52,419 --> 00:31:01,389
you've met during the week oh yes yeah

627
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:04,690
comes later there's also - Tuesday

628
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:09,639
Monday Monday morning is the IITs

629
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:11,559
sisters breakfast you can see at eight

630
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:13,570
you can see I'm sure all to sign up for

631
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:15,460
that if you want anybody who identifies

632
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,918
as female is welcome to come to that

633
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,760
it's a support organization for women

634
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,900
within the ITF

635
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,190
and there's a slide in the picture

636
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:27,230
coming up there's a lot of activities

637
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,030
not on the agenda hallway meetings barb

638
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,000
offs that's where it's like hey let's go

639
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,920
talk about network disk drive access

640
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,330
things like Dropbox and Google Drive and

641
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,790
so on and they go off to a bar and talk

642
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:40,189
right marathon editing sessions we're

643
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,930
trying to resolve some nasty issues that

644
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,760
the working group is identified we'll

645
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,020
just get together in a closed room or

646
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,240
you know if there's little breakout

647
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,420
rooms throughout and do that we have an

648
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,130
app the agenda as I mentioned working

649
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,050
group sessions of the main point that's

650
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,380
sort of the justification why most of us

651
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,030
are here not everybody about most of us

652
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:02,450
work is officially and the ITF work is

653
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,850
officially done on mailing lists the

654
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,190
meetings face to face or to talk about

655
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,780
what's happened since the last face to

656
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:12,830
face meeting what the open issues are

657
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:14,210
the quick you know the age to one of

658
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,550
those two working groups for example is

659
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,080
only about issues there's no new work

660
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:22,040
being discussed that's what their agenda

661
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,870
says the sessions are all streamed and

662
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,780
recorded this session is being streamed

663
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:30,199
and recorded as well find folks in the

664
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:32,000
back of the room so you can always it's

665
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,190
often worthwhile this usually

666
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,480
unavoidable conflicts I really wanted to

667
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,360
go to this and that but they're meeting

668
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,850
at the same time shortly after the ITF

669
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:46,070
meeting go to the IETF YouTube channel

670
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:49,550
on YouTube and watch the meeting that

671
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:52,220
you didn't see birds of a feather I

672
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,470
mentioned here is opposed to session

673
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,710
summon presenting at the reception for

674
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,480
their birds of a feather acme the

675
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,870
certificates encrypt certificate

676
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,420
protocol now does 10 million

677
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,889
certificates a year and it started you

678
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,540
know it started up and then there was a

679
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,190
buff and then it was a working group and

680
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,610
the RFC was published you know six

681
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:16,760
months ago so they can be very

682
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:19,280
successful i RTF it's officially part of

683
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,350
one of these alphabet soup organizations

684
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,550
that Chantal pointed to that's on top

685
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:28,120
sorry I'm child pointed to I get up very

686
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,120
early this way

687
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:36,910
there's a RFC primer on the difference

688
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:39,070
between the IETF and the IRT F as I said

689
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,980
they share on purpose a lot of similar

690
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:46,270
terminology and they're hosted by the

691
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:49,600
same parent organization applied

692
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,520
networking research it's a forum for you

693
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,110
know academics this is how we bring are

694
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,360
starting to bring more academic

695
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:59,909
involvement and participation tonight

696
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,459
into the IETF there is also the I

697
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:05,980
applied networking research prize it

698
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,590
includes a free trip to the ITF and I

699
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,630
think a thousand dollars for the best

700
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:13,000
engineering paper networking paper

701
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,919
presented in the past year and that will

702
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,918
be presented I guess at the plenary

703
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:23,620
plenary is a Latin word it means

704
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:25,179
everybody so this is what the plenary

705
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,668
looks like it'll be held in the great

706
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,460
pardon me held in the grand ballroom the

707
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:32,259
same one that the reception is in

708
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,570
there's a dais at the front and the

709
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,450
various leadership teams will cycle

710
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,460
through that I'm on the IAB you got any

711
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:42,730
questions with the IAB ok next I'm in

712
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,139
the iesg any questions ok next I'm the

713
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,219
executive director here's what our

714
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:50,230
budget looks like next its nitty-gritty

715
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,830
details about how the organization works

716
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,990
this year there's also a separate

717
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:58,600
co-located just before technical plenary

718
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:00,850
and I don't recall what the topic is but

719
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,069
worthwhile nothing else is scheduled

720
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:07,029
against the plenaries invited lunch talk

721
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:10,330
the sponsor in this case nbc/universal

722
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:13,270
Comcast Comcast nbc/universal whatever

723
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:18,069
their thing is they will have a speaker

724
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:20,680
I think on Thursday hackathons and code

725
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:23,140
sprints so the first time you haven't

726
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,520
missed it you sort of missed it now the

727
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:29,080
code sprint is we're on Saturdays we're

728
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,410
smaller group of people developed the

729
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,350
website that powers all of the workflow

730
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:38,140
for generating RFC's hackathons

731
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,970
our four people just want to get

732
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,920
together and discuss you know and work

733
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,319
on their implementation make sure they

734
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,040
interoperate notable successes have been

735
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,190
quick

736
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:54,009
TLS one three right now we're doing teep

737
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:55,510
and some DNS work at later on in the

738
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,760
week there'll be a hackathon happy hour

739
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,290
will they'll be a presentation from some

740
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,560
of the more successful things in the

741
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:05,910
future it's sort of freeze its separate

742
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,950
registration they provide nice lunch

743
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,930
table space and you can just sign up on

744
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:14,740
a wiki for things you are interested in

745
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:16,509
working on for the next ITF next ITF is

746
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:19,870
November and Singapore and then after

747
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:23,200
that it's I think Vancouver social

748
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:25,630
events so the picture on the left is

749
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,850
from the social in Singapore the

750
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:33,640
National Aquarium a really big tank a

751
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:35,830
very big tank and then when a picture on

752
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:41,740
the right is a picture from the sisters

753
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:45,310
breakfast from London okay so a number

754
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:50,049
of sessions ago there are also many many

755
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:53,259
informal sessions the ITF starts in the

756
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,200
morning we serve a continental breakfast

757
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,520
many people get the hotel breakfast

758
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,970
there's the side meetings and formal

759
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,890
chats

760
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,720
planning for the day skimming over the

761
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,509
dock you know the drafts that you want

762
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,549
for the meetings you want to attend all

763
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,100
the way through you know lump there's a

764
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,360
break there's lunch there's dinner

765
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,120
sometimes there's a session after dinner

766
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,700
that's often the plenary for example and

767
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,549
then you get together often not required

768
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,930
get together with friends colleagues

769
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:23,440
people you just met earlier in the day

770
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:26,319
to have after-dinner beer drink go out

771
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:31,780
and socialize or more likely go out and

772
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:34,510
work it is a long day there are lots of

773
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:38,260
things going on and which brings me to

774
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:40,120
the last bullet on this slide remember

775
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,490
sleep it's tiring by the end of the week

776
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,589
as tired as people are of seeing that

777
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,990
note well slide that on shell started

778
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,910
with you'll see it at every single

779
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:52,200
session

780
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:55,680
as a reminder don't talk about private

781
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,009
patents don't harass anybody be kind to

782
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,480
your neighbors got the note well stuff

783
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,339
they'll be even more tired just you know

784
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,990
ready to crash out on the flights or

785
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,380
driving on the way home however you get

786
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,490
home

787
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,900
a few key points about etiquette we want

788
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:14,689
to be respectful and tolerant towards

789
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:19,079
everybody the ITF started as a u.s.

790
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:21,299
contracted kind of thing it hasn't grown

791
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:23,359
to be global we are deliberately for

792
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,940
example we meet once in the US

793
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,828
Hemisphere once in Europe in March we

794
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,099
were in Prague last March and then once

795
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:34,530
in Asia so it's 1 1 1 to get global

796
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,740
participation we try to make sure that

797
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:40,049
people who can't attend in person are

798
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:45,149
able to participate such as streaming

799
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:46,980
and YouTube videos also we have

800
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,440
something called Medeco which is a great

801
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:54,299
service where people can participate

802
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,770
remotely or just listening remotely so

803
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:58,680
we've had remote presenters we will

804
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,809
present on a often on a topic they just

805
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,230
can't make it to wherever the meeting

806
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:06,089
happens to be talked and listen

807
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,690
listening is obviously more important

808
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:13,038
than talking bringing new work to the

809
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:17,480
ITF we're trying to encourage this

810
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:20,039
except maybe blockchain that's a joke

811
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,410
find the way to do it if you have an

812
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,630
idea that you think might be useful to

813
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,960
help the internet work better that's a

814
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:30,299
very broad umbrella on purpose find some

815
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,730
collaborators good ways you know well

816
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:34,470
this is kind of related working group so

817
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,940
let me go specialize that let me talk to

818
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,098
the working group chair see if they

819
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,230
think it's interesting let me put a note

820
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,819
near the schedules paper schedules that

821
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,549
are printed in the registration area

822
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:47,009
I guess down that way um just get a

823
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:49,259
bunch of people together post on the

824
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,869
IETF 105 attendees list hey I want to

825
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,779
talk about you know ways to use DNS to

826
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:57,240
find my phone whatever it's gonna be you

827
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:58,440
hold it you propose a path that's you're

828
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,790
starting to get into more formal

829
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,410
structure there is to toriel

830
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:06,970
from a couple meetings ago on how to

831
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:08,980
bring new work to the ITF the slides are

832
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:11,589
available there's also a video of that

833
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,110
presentation so just because there's

834
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,600
things used it's a good vibrant

835
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:20,620
technical community always eager to get

836
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:24,730
involved in more areas the way working

837
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:27,520
groups work so the rules will all be set

838
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,320
up like this they'll be at the table

839
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,120
will be the working group chairs their

840
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,610
primary responsibility is time

841
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,970
management for example I can tell you

842
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:39,010
right now we're gonna run long they

843
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,470
could they coordinate the speakers have

844
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:45,790
set up the agenda and all of the slides

845
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:49,359
before the meeting the speaker's stand

846
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:51,670
here in this case there's a pink X to

847
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,710
make sure that the video cameras are you

848
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,720
know can record you if you step off

849
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:59,200
camera it's uncomfortable to the people

850
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,209
remote and to the video there's a

851
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,919
microphone this is a smaller room so

852
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,060
there's one with the plenaries

853
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:12,100
there are six or eight a bigger meeting

854
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:14,140
such as TLS or DNS we'll have two mics

855
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,200
and you know the rooms will be almost

856
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,900
half again or twice this size if you

857
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,600
want to say something you say you come

858
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,100
up to the mic and there's a line and the

859
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,049
chair will say you know next the line

860
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,630
you say your name Rick Saul's

861
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:31,660
for identification you say your company

862
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:33,580
your affiliation rich Sol's Akamai and I

863
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,680
think and then you say what your point

864
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,529
is if it's directly addressing a

865
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,180
presenter you know I think that the

866
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:43,030
extension you wrote there could be

867
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,419
better improved by doing this and that's

868
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,630
it

869
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,790
there are blue sheets which will go

870
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,110
around on those done at the beginning of

871
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,300
the meeting collected at the end of the

872
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:55,270
meeting you write your name your

873
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,220
affiliation those are scanned and posted

874
00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:00,009
and put online so we have a record of

875
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,540
all the attendees again that's to ensure

876
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,210
compliance with you know make sure

877
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:06,480
there's no submarine patent work going

878
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:09,280
on we've been pretty good about that and

879
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,080
also to help plan in the future meeting

880
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,940
well you know the chairs they go well

881
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,210
I've got 75 people and want to come to

882
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,950
mind

883
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,780
meeting and we can look at the blue

884
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,520
sheets and go really you only had 20 the

885
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,430
last three so maybe we'll give you a

886
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,960
smaller room any kind of technical

887
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:25,149
comment and questions are discussed

888
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,290
while somebody is presenting someone can

889
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,970
come up to the mic and say I have a

890
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,320
clarifying question I didn't understand

891
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,589
what you just said that that and then

892
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,810
details about what your confusion was

893
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:37,440
there is a jabber we would talk about

894
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:40,630
the resources I'm cha will mention that

895
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,090
instant messaging protocol there's

896
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,730
always a jabber room available always a

897
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:48,220
jabber room open for people put in

898
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:51,490
questions and comments and also to keep

899
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:53,620
track of what the slides are with that

900
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,419
I'll turn it back over to Chantal unless

901
00:42:53,620 --> 00:43:00,569
it someone has a question on what I just

902
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,570
talked about for this week great

903
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,660
okay I'll keep going I'll try to bring

904
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,620
it on time which means I will talk even

905
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:15,020
faster there is a person associated with

906
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,319
the ITF called Eric named Eric risk or

907
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,360
allure

908
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:22,940
he's often called by his initials ecker

909
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:26,480
ekr and his speaking style is the unit

910
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:29,480
of speed for speaking so people say oh I

911
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,630
speak at half an acre or I can speak it

912
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,100
you know 0.9 of a Necker and he speaks

913
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,450
really really quickly and he's very

914
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,810
technical and it's really hard sometimes

915
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:42,200
to understand him don't worry you're not

916
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:44,029
alone but anyhow I will speak a little

917
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,060
quicker to try to get us to finish close

918
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:50,270
to time the Secretariat are the key

919
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,830
resources for this week the lovely

920
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,590
people in blue shirts I think they're

921
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,240
all women they are the ones who handle

922
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,730
the logistics when we couldn't figure

923
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,229
out how to get the slides projected here

924
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,560
right it was somebody in the blue shirt

925
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,790
who came up they handle the registration

926
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,400
they handle the paperwork the

927
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:09,440
coordination of everything they collect

928
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,110
the blue sheets scan them you know after

929
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,380
the meeting and so on lovely people we

930
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:17,960
couldn't do this week without them also

931
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,520
noticeable on Friday is we're starting

932
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,840
to take down everything or they're

933
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,910
starting to take down everything they

934
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:31,310
changed the Hawaiian shirts RFC editor

935
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:33,080
there are two tables out by the up

936
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:35,240
either in the registration area one is

937
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,009
for the ROC editor those are the people

938
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,620
who copy edit and actually do the

939
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:43,400
publishing of the documents once they've

940
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:45,109
been approved by the isg having left the

941
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,540
working group having been written by the

942
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:50,570
working group authors so that's the

943
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,340
workflow the RFC editor and then there's

944
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:55,850
I Anna the internet assigned numbers

945
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:59,150
Authority that ensures for example that

946
00:44:55,850 --> 00:45:03,080
DNS uses port 53 and nobody else does

947
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:05,180
then the HTTP uses port 443 and nobody

948
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,950
else does there's a whole bunch of

949
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,020
number spaces that have to be managed

950
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,939
and assigned some of the numbers have

951
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:13,100
names

952
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:15,710
so I Anna handles all of that

953
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,460
other notable thing about these two

954
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,810
organizations outside of their being

955
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,470
and some are paid and some are

956
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:23,869
volunteers they always have candy out so

957
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:28,069
if you need a quick pick-me-up

958
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:28,070
hi oh I love the job you're doing

959
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:36,390
poor Sherwin's danly is our interim

960
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:38,190
executive director the ITF recently went

961
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:41,730
through a slight reorganization for

962
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,260
legal purposes to form a legal entity as

963
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:46,380
opposed to being this sort of amorphous

964
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,109
thing guiding through that is Ben

965
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,670
Porsche who is the executive director

966
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:56,640
you know signs the checks keeps the

967
00:45:50,670 --> 00:46:00,720
lights on the Ombuds team the ITF has a

968
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:04,279
very strict no harassment policy nobody

969
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,140
should feel harassed bothered

970
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,290
constrained from talking constrained

971
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,509
from giving their technical opinion

972
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:14,550
similarly you should feel constrained

973
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,859
from insulting the way somebody looks or

974
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:20,070
commenting on them or saying you know I

975
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:22,770
think you're really stupid no you can

976
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:25,349
say that idea isn't good and here's why

977
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:27,300
but don't you know obviously we know how

978
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,630
to act like mature adults towards each

979
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,230
other

980
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:33,150
a hard part of this is as I'm tal

981
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:36,900
mentioned many of these people have

982
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:39,780
known each other for years or decades so

983
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,550
somebody will stand up you know Barry

984
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,670
Lebowitz tanned up and go you know

985
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,619
that's really dumb of you Mike or Mike

986
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,660
will say just a really stupid conclusion

987
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:49,980
you have to separate sometimes from the

988
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:53,250
people if they look

989
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:56,280
middle-aged us with beards they've been

990
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:59,570
around for a long time I'm not

991
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,430
middle-aged we have a team of ombudsman

992
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:05,190
there's a policy about it I'm but the

993
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,779
Ombuds team there is anti harassment

994
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,510
policy there's pictures of the people

995
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,930
involved all three of them are very long

996
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:14,490
time ITF participants if you see

997
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:19,169
anything and they have a particular

998
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:20,609
sticker on it's a green tag at the

999
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,550
bottom of there so you know neon green

1000
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:26,700
go up and and the big will handle things

1001
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:28,710
appropriately and so on on mailing lists

1002
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,540
we have a organization called the

1003
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,930
sergeant of arms who has occasionally

1004
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,270
step

1005
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,160
recently to try to make sure that this

1006
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:40,230
course is civil mature and respectful

1007
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,520
who's who working group chairs those are

1008
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,770
the people as I said who will sit at the

1009
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,890
front and handle all the things they've

1010
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,270
a blue button like that on their badge

1011
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,410
sometime the other important thing is

1012
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,599
the smiley face

1013
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,220
that's a sticker anybody can put on and

1014
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,309
it means I am willing to answer

1015
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,709
questions about the IETF obviously on

1016
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,869
trial and I are up here to help

1017
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,780
introduce you and we're willing to

1018
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:06,150
answer questions about the IETF so later

1019
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,300
this evening when there is the Welcome

1020
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:10,980
Reception for everyone as you're

1021
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,569
wandering around with you know plate of

1022
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,130
hors d'oeuvres and stacks or whatever it

1023
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:15,869
is and you see you have a question look

1024
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,480
you can look for someone or you might

1025
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:22,020
recognize a familiar face do ask

1026
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:26,069
questions we want people to come learn

1027
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,660
contribute and not leave we want to keep

1028
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:30,089
you here and it's not because we make

1029
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,980
money right and the the way you can

1030
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:33,990
participate purely by joining mailing

1031
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,000
lists and it doesn't cost anything

1032
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:39,750
except some time and you know mental

1033
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,920
work to join the mailing list some

1034
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:45,960
resources the DAO of the IETF no

1035
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,290
disrespect intended to the Buddhists it

1036
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,510
was name chosen liberally describes sort

1037
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,430
of the philosophical underpinnings of

1038
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:57,420
the organization's and shall talked

1039
00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:01,710
about we are unlike many other standards

1040
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:03,540
organizations ISO ITU has one vote per

1041
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:07,619
country and the national standards

1042
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,700
organization and CBS I I forget what you

1043
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:10,440
know and so on

1044
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,629
they pick who their representatives are

1045
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,540
gonna be anybody you can join the

1046
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:17,160
mailing list anybody gets an equal say

1047
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:19,440
there's a specific newcomers page for

1048
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,078
this IETF and they were also the

1049
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,030
tutorials are all available not just the

1050
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,530
newcomers but going back in time as we

1051
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:31,859
said how to write how to bring new work

1052
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:33,960
in how to write an RFC and so on get

1053
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:36,720
more meeting resources all of these are

1054
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,500
available in the slides which are on the

1055
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:44,399
data tracker next slide

1056
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:49,030
data tracker that IETF org or

1057
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,930
TTS org this is the website that is

1058
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:54,490
manages all of the document workflow

1059
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:57,100
everything we do goes through the data

1060
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:59,319
tracker so every working group every

1061
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,750
team which isn't quite a working group

1062
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,790
as Karen mentioned at the beginning the

1063
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:07,470
edge you team that people who do this

1064
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:10,180
there's an RFC team who handle the

1065
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,830
defining that the content not the

1066
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,649
content but defining the style and

1067
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:18,130
markup of the RFC's they all have pages

1068
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:20,859
on here the most common thing I type is

1069
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:23,020
DT that I ate EF the Doric /wg

1070
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:25,630
for a working group slash and then what

1071
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:28,480
the working groups abbreviation is the

1072
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:30,910
IETF is fond perhaps overly fond of

1073
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:35,380
having coming up with pronounceable

1074
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:39,940
English kind of pseudo words right lurk

1075
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:42,850
t DNS op no not that T a quick and so on

1076
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:48,220
so but that's a way to find and from

1077
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:49,420
there as you see on the right-hand it

1078
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:53,009
works so you see on the right hand side

1079
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:56,350
over there that is a working group page

1080
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:57,700
it shows all of the doc all of the

1081
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:00,220
drafts that are currently in progress

1082
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:02,230
what their state is sometimes they're

1083
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:05,379
waiting for the area director and the

1084
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:08,230
isg to move them forward tabs across the

1085
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:11,200
top overview the of the working group

1086
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:14,020
the documents the mailing lists from the

1087
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,689
website you can join any number of the

1088
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:19,390
all of the ITF mailing lists are on data

1089
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,980
tracker dot IETF Thor org the tools is

1090
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,839
once you start to get involved in

1091
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:26,109
writing RFC's then you may care about

1092
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,450
the tools but for now don't bother the

1093
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:33,509
data tracker is your friend or the bane

1094
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:33,509
of your existence remote participation

1095
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,320
attendance is not required

1096
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:40,000
the only time attendance is required is

1097
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,800
if you want to participate in the

1098
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,680
nominating committee or be selected for

1099
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,530
the nominating committee we support

1100
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,390
remote attendance for at all of the

1101
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:51,570
working group sessions many of the other

1102
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:55,509
sessions like I said that this tutorial

1103
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:57,310
the these side meetings are not remotely

1104
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:59,320
they'll available

1105
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:01,509
and we have a team meet echo those are

1106
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,290
the people find folks on the meet echo

1107
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:07,570
team very friendly and helpful there's

1108
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:10,240
always a video AV person in the back of

1109
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:15,700
the room handling the streaming the mics

1110
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:18,069
and so on the network if you haven't

1111
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,980
logged into the ITF network yet it is a

1112
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:23,320
thing of wonder people arrive about a

1113
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,000
week early they bring in all sorts of

1114
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:29,770
you know working with the local telecom

1115
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,220
company they bring in all sorts of extra

1116
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,500
capacity there are a number of IETF

1117
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:39,910
networks depending on whether you do you

1118
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:43,300
know ipv6 ipv4 ipv6 and for forum six

1119
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:45,370
legacy whatever it's going to be for all

1120
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:49,050
of the ones that require a name and

1121
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:52,750
password the name and password or IETF

1122
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:55,630
the purpose of that is not to be prevent

1123
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,610
people from getting access to the

1124
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,650
network it's to make sure that we can do

1125
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:01,390
encryption right you log into the

1126
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:04,060
network and then you get keys and so on

1127
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:07,210
we try to avoid you know there was a big

1128
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:09,400
RFC published shortly after Edward

1129
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:12,040
Snowden that says surveillance is a

1130
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,920
threat um that we need to mitigate so we

1131
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,480
try to move everyone towards encryption

1132
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,150
funny story when I was walking around I

1133
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,430
guess down the underground shopping

1134
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,230
center things someone goes I don't know

1135
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:26,339
what this ayat if hotel is or where it

1136
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:29,320
is but boy do they have great internet

1137
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:31,690
it really is amazing and it will run

1138
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:36,040
through Friday through the end of the

1139
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:38,170
sessions there's a quiet space there's a

1140
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,620
terminal room it doesn't have terminals

1141
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:44,470
anymore it just has wired power cords

1142
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,000
and wired Ethernet there's a printer if

1143
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:48,970
you need to print your boarding pass or

1144
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,190
a last-minute document it's now out by

1145
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:53,620
the registration area so that you can

1146
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:58,030
just there's a little sticky note on the

1147
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:59,560
printer that says how to access it the

1148
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:02,530
helpdesk is also out in the registration

1149
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:06,120
area jabber

1176
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:25,230
expand your mind week and it is

1177
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:29,069
exhausting not just because of the long

1178
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:30,960
hours but even if you're not on and

1179
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:36,140

let's do a practice hum just so you know

1202
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:51,020
what it's like here's the way it works

1203
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:53,930
the chairs will say okay here's what the

1204
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,550
question is and they will always be the

1205
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:58,100
possible it's always multiple choice the

1206
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:59,720
possible answers and then the the last

1207
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,270
part of the question is always don't

1208
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:06,290
know enough can't decide yet so the

1209
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:09,020
question is the question will be did you

1210
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:11,870
find this useful and the choices are yes

1211
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:16,520
no or can't decide so how many people

1212

found this useful please hum now how

1213
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,470

1214
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:24,620
please hum down how many people can't

1215
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:26,480
decide yet okay so that was pretty clear
