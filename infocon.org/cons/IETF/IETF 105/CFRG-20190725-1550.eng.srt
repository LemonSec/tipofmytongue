2
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:12,520
this is Jeff Dunham

3
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:13,390
I suppose all right good afternoon

4
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:19,260
everybody

5
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:21,160
I hope you are here for say FRG right

6
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,480
please take your seats

7
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,480
finish your conversations

8
00:02:34,500 --> 00:03:02,260
which I didn't ask okay so see FRG is

9
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:06,340
part of IR T f so we abide by the same

10
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,410
rules but as i TS oh not well applies I

11
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:15,520
hope that's not the first time you've

12
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:22,180
seen it this week I think we have Java

13
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:41,410
scrub we have no takers you might notice

14
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:45,160
that we have just use this one so we

15
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:48,790
have a new co-chair Nick Sullivan

16
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:52,359
sitting next to me can is absent we also

17
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:54,880
have C FRG secretary now which is tennis

18
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:00,580
valve who's going to help us waste time

19
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:04,240
keeping today very quickly document

20
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,550
status we managed to publish two

21
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,610
documents since Prague

22
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:15,730
we have rekeying still in our editors

23
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:18,670
queue our argon too is getting really

24
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:24,820
really close to being in irst review and

25
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:28,870
being approved spec to Kenny still need

26
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,849
to have a look at this in the list of

27
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,940
active documents you can see we who

28
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,740
actually cook have accepted quite a lot

29
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:42,160
of documents we have eight documents at

30
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:44,160
the moment so quite a lot of work but

31
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,070
some of them in early stages you know

32
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:56,560
luckily we're not going to publish them

33
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:58,870
all at the same time chairs rely heavily

34
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,630
on crypto review panel which was formed

35
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:06,880
in September 2016 the purpose of crypto

36
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,770
review panel is to reviewed to help

37
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,290
review documents Foshee frg whether

38
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,169
they're just beginning their lifecycle

39
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,000
or are in research group last call as

40
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:21,330
well as helping security area and an

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,610
independent stream to get reviews of of

42
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:28,750
crypto algorithms there were lots of

43
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:32,340
very good reviews done chairs will be

44
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:37,690
relying on crypto panel to calc with

45
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,520
reviewing packs admissions in order to

46
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,560
do that we just you know chairs just

47
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,049
realized that the term of existing

48
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,300
members already extended by one year

49
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,200
would have ended in September so

50
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,710
extended until the end of the year also

51
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,170
we are reopening nominations so we are

52
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,229
looking for new new candidates so if you

53
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,410
know somebody who will be good or

54
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,300
whether they have more academic

55
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,860
experience or even in industry and

56
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,000
protocol use experience we are looking

57
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:15,100
for both please submit nominations by

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,950
September 1st to see FRG chairs and self

59
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:27,150
nominations are very welcome

60
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:31,240
so don't be shy one of the main sort of

61
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,310
big tasks that we started last time a

62
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,480
spec selection process we have eight

63
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:40,090
submissions submission nominations ended

64
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:47,310
in June we got preliminary information

65
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:47,310
from all submitters the aim is to

66
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:58,740
hopefully find more than 0 but recommend

67
00:06:53,009 --> 00:07:00,649
or more packs to see FRG recommended

68
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,819
documents

69
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:08,099
Stanislav is helping out with organizing

70
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,719
the process and he will have a talk at

71
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,949
the end about the current status the

72
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:20,610
current submissions if people have

73
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:23,419
suggestions for chairs how to which kind

74
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,849
of questions to ask to help us decide

75
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:33,899
please contact us either at cfd chairs

76
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:38,430
or talk to us privately and on that I

77
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:40,229
think we are starting yes my apologies

78
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,379
we're two minutes late but we'll start

79
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,378
with the first presentation

80
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,030
this is about the hpk draft which is the

81
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,850
current slightly suboptimal name hybrid

82
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,739
public key encryption in that it is the

83
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,790
encryption that combines an asymmetric

84
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:25,010
operation public key operation with IAD

85
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:27,770
so this is now graphed IRT f c/f RG h PK

86
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,420
we submitted 0-0 just before the draft

87
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:34,250
of the main after having a successful

88
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:36,289
adoption call so let's so made a couple

89
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,030
changes between the the last individual

90
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:42,020
version in this one that we're kind of

91
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:45,319
cleanup oriented um sorry I love them

92
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,090
the monitor here is not working so the

93
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,340
main change in this draft was to kind of

94
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,140
clean up the logic we had a diagram like

95
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,830
this in the last deck and we presented

96
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,390
this in Prague that had a lot more boxes

97
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,050
and basically we've pulled all of the

98
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,760
logic into this encryption context

99
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,500
creation function which gets a bunch of

100
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,930
parameters from a setup function

101
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,060
depending on what mode you're in

102
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,949
and then generates a context and some

103
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,609
key announced that you'll use for

104
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:19,640
encryption operations based on that that

105
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:22,250
context Thanks so in the earlier draft

106
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,319
in the individual at zero zero we only

107
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,120
had the one mode where you just encrypt

108
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,410
to a public key and zero one we added

109
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,600
these other modes where you can encrypt

110
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,459
or you can encrypt to a public key and

111
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,310
also authenticate that the sender has a

112
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,250
given symmetric secret of PSK or that

113
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,949
the sender has a given private key on

114
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,900
this earth mode one of the things that

115
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,880
this consolidation gave us was that we

116
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,350
can now have a mode where the sender can

117
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,060
prove both of those things they can

118
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,070
prove both that they hold a given

119
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,959
symmetric secret at PSK and that they

120
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,580
hold a given any symmetric private key I

121
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,870
don't know how much you said is I don't

122
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,640
think there's an immediate use case for

123
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,810
that but it just seemed like for the

124
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,660
sake of completeness we have the

125
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,979
capability of why not just add the mode

126
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,449
one of the questions here I'll get to in

127
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,310
a second is whether we think that's

128
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,320
worth it so that that's the major

129
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,410
technical change in draft 0/0 of this

130
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,170
draft otherwise it's it's pretty much

131
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,689
the same as as the earlier versions

132
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,029
since the last IETF we have now two

133
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:20,360
implementations I've done one and go and

134
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:22,519
Dave Cridland has done one in Python

135
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,529
these kind of do orthogonal there are

136
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,139
good at orthogonal things so Davis is

137
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,059
really nice because the pseudo code and

138
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:31,369
it's in the spec is kind of Python

139
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,559
looking and Dave's is in pseudo code is

140
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:35,059
in Python and huge very closely to the

141
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,290
the pseudo code that's in the draft so

142
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:39,379
it's very easy to understand that way

143
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,759
I've my go implementation is a little

144
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,199
bit more completeness oriented so it

145
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,019
covers all the cipher suites that are in

146
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:45,949
the draft right now and as of yesterday

147
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,139
include psych as a kind of a

148
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:49,939
demonstration proof case that we can

149
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:51,860
integrate a post quantum count because

150
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:55,129
one of the things we did in zero zero

151
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,379
one was like it changed from a th

152
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:59,779
orientation to a camera orientation with

153
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,029
this idea that we could use post quantum

154
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,679
chemist air and you know we have at

155
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,389
least kind of empirical code based

156
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,649
validation that that's possible I've

157
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:08,179
been had this reviewed by anyone it may

158
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,670
be using it completely in securely but

159
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12,980
it at least like compiles and runs and

160
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,569
passes tests and it was actually a

161
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,459
pretty small patch like once we had the

162
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:17,988
framework for this set up it was really

163
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:20,059
just that that little bit of glue code

164
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:21,559
to get the post problem can patched in

165
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,238
so I think it's kind of a promising sign

166
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,889
for the ability of this construction to

167
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:26,889
evolve forward into a post quantum world

168
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,860
there was some discussion on the mailing

169
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:33,019
list and during the adoption hall about

170
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,089
some other things one might ask for out

171
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,610
of this this construction and I think

172
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,839
that we discussed in the list and I

173
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,910
think that we kind of got some pretty

174
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,669
good consensus on not addressing some of

175
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,799
these things right now so forward

176
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,939
secrecy is kind of not a sensible thing

177
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,259
to address here that's kind of a

178
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,699
property of the key that you are

179
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,319
encrypting to so we're going to build a

180
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,579
construction here for encrypting to a

181
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:54,679
public key and then forward secrecy

182
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,748
properties depend on how you rotate that

183
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,459
public key and things like that so it is

184
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,689
we're building up something here that

185
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:01,069
you can then embed into other systems

186
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:02,988
that provide things like forward secrecy

187
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,139
MLS for example will provide foreign

188
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:10,850
secrecy in PCs properties

189
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:12,860
k-ci resistance honestly I'm not you

190
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,779
know the I don't feel like I deeply

191
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,619
understand this but I some other folks

192
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,449
who can help be honest on this I think

193
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:22,429
the the the all of the words in this

194
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,410
this bullet here makes sense if you have

195
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:27,800
a one-round can

196
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,750
based protocol we can't resist that

197
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,279
style of attack um you need something

198
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,819
like digital signatures from from the

199
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,959
sender to make that possible and I think

200
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,729
the feeling right now is it doesn't make

201
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,709
sense to add in that extra machinery to

202
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,259
get that property again if you need that

203
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:44,540
property you can add it in higher layers

204
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,879
higher layers than this I'm finally post

205
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,319
quantum um I don't think it makes sense

206
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,730
to put that in the spec right now as I

207
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:51,620
as I said in the last slide we kind of

208
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,089
demonstrated that it works so it's good

209
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,980
to have that validation it's possible

210
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,139
but I don't think it makes sense like to

211
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,089
find cipher suites that are post partum

212
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:01,220
cams right now because we just we don't

213
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:04,100
have anything that's kind of ready for

214
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,829
to have a code point quite yet so that's

215
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,449
kind of the state of the art where the

216
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:10,310
frame a couple questions for the working

217
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:11,449
group because you know now that we've

218
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,040
got it adopted we can start thinking

219
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:19,008
about how do we get it to the state of

220
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:23,480
completion dan you have question Dan

221
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:27,529
Harkins if the sender reused his key

222
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,300
pair and then the D H K M then the

223
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:34,009
context would produce the same secret in

224
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:36,199
the same nonce right no because there's

225
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,329
an ephemeral key pair that's generated

226
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:41,359
in D H Kim case there's a ephemeral

227
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,859
keeper that's generated that is fed into

228
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,339
the context that generates the key and

229
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,899
the nonce so that each encryption fresh

230
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,269
entropy it's impossible to do static

231
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:54,860
static in the D hm

232
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,740
Chris you're not in can you better than

233
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,880
Mike maybe that's okay nodding is this

234
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:07,699
one okay yeah I don't there is no mode

235
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:09,079
where everything is static yeah yeah so

236
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,389
think about now like what do we need to

237
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,219
do to get to completion here I think the

238
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:15,100
major question in my mind here is is

239
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,110
this draft I'm trying to do too much

240
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,970
there's all these modes we talked about

241
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,529
how you authenticate the sender in these

242
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,059
various ways we've got we talked about

243
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,209
how you do multiple encryptions off with

244
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:27,529
a single context generation I think the

245
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:29,388
feeling of the authors with those that

246
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,920
those things were useful we had kind of

247
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,139
demonstrated use cases from some of the

248
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,569
prior art with Nicole and things like

249
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,450
that where people were using doing

250
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,949
making uses that have

251
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,630
same general shape so it made sense to

252
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,890
cover those in this talk but I could

253
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,510
understand if you've wanted to slim this

254
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,740
down and and have a more straightforward

255
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,560
doctor review and do analysis on so

256
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:54,670
people have lots of comments on that we

257
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,650
lengthen the jabber room Tania lang it

258
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:01,510
depends on how they define ephemeral as

259
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:05,260
one time Moshe Schwartz tongue yeah I

260
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,670
think that's I think it in the sense in

261
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,680
which we mean ephemeral here is that the

262
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,209
the key pair has generated for the

263
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,239
purpose of the single encryption so it

264
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,190
really is one-time use Adam Adam Langley

265
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,140
so if you're worried about doing too

266
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,780
much I think the example of noise might

267
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:22,030
be useful if you've seen noise to say a

268
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,579
framework for to party communication

269
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:27,459
protocols which has generated like noise

270
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:31,570
Explorer which generates like formal

271
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,860
proofs of many many of these things and

272
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,320
tells you exactly what properties you

273
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,870
get and so forth like that I think was

274
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,090
useful and demonstrated that you know

275
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,190
you could do something worthwhile with

276
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,740
an over general system so if you go

277
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,870
there I think like being general is good

278
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,130
but this is the ITF and obviously

279
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,390
they've been plenty of protocols they've

280
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,490
been over general and that hasn't

281
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,220
produced any positive effects so when

282
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,290
you say go there what do you mean I mean

283
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,450
if you start add you've got four modes

284
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:03,699
now I'm sure there were others in your

285
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:04,870
mind and and so forth so it I guess I'm

286
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,620
saying like look at some of noise

287
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,060
Explorer as as I think a high point of

288
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,370
what you can do with a more general

289
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,310
framework and if you don't want to you

290
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:20,230
don't do all that then like trim stuff

291
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:22,270
away this you mean yeah I think analysis

292
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,130
was the the other big thing we're

293
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,170
waiting on here I think the INRIA team

294
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,030
at least are looking to do like a single

295
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,449
composed analysis of this much like you

296
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:33,250
did a single compose notes on TLS from

297
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,070
which the verification modes kind of

298
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,300
falls out of special cases I think this

299
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,950
is still a slow enough target that

300
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,319
that's a reasonable thing to do

301
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,900
the logic is fairly well consolidated

302
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,070
and so I think I think if this is kind

303
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,439
of our thuggin all approaches to the

304
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,820
noise compositional approach in the

305
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,040
noisy explore approach but I think this

306
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,600
is still reasonably

307
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,130
simply composed to make that sort of

308
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,260
serving else as possible of course I

309
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,180
don't do the analysis and so I can't let

310
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,959
speak authoritative look at that yeah

311
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:05,079
yeah Riyadh Wahby if you were removing

312
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,668
things what would you remove like you

313
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,678
say are we doing too much there are four

314
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:10,510
options if you had your druthers would

315
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,549
you remove any of them I think the

316
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,569
simplest the the thing that would could

317
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,859
would be removed that would make the

318
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:19,149
most impact is the modes in which the

319
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,829
sender's are authenticated with an

320
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,579
asymmetric key because this requires

321
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,799
this authen cap off the cap thing which

322
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,399
is only like I don't know if that really

323
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,410
extends to any non d.h Kem's and we just

324
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,900
kind of define it that hoc for kemp's

325
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,250
now that I mean that is if you look for

326
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,010
if you're looking for like a feature

327
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:41,020
parity with the Box API I think that is

328
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,400
that feature exists there so there's

329
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,929
some benefits of having it there but it

330
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,850
does introduce some additional

331
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,830
complexity into the spec and you know

332
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,520
it's more more optional things to keep

333
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,199
around as one more thought would it be

334
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:59,290
reasonable to consider removing the

335
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,490
unauthenticated case there arguably

336
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:06,100
there's no reason to use it on

337
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:08,740
authenticated so I don't not sure it

338
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,659
would streamline things much that's here

339
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,179
that was what I was suspecting so yeah I

340
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:16,179
mean it might streamline things if you

341
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,850
are going to remove focusing on only the

342
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:21,309
PSK case or only the authentic a

343
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,510
symmetric case right if you were going

344
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,940
to do one of those then you could cut

345
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,830
out awesome stuff related to the

346
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,000
unauthenticated case but if you're going

347
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,770
to have both of those and you're gonna

348
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,770
have some optional stuff on both sides

349
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,600
then the the unauthenticated case kind

350
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,139
of remove it emerges as a special case

351
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,168
so yeah I'm not sure that's simplify so

352
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:46,510
I appreciate the the the instinct Thanks

353
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:48,549
yeah hi Giselle if this were a working

354
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,669
group I would say like we would really

355
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:53,650
want to take out things we didn't have a

356
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:57,960
work use case for as a research group on

357
00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:00,850
may be less inclined to that but I think

358
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,740
probably if we can trim stuff out it

359
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,820
would be better both for the amount of

360
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,559
work involved in improving it but as you

361
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,189
say some some things may just fall out

362
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,590
and it may be a non-issue but it kind of

363
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,130
helps to have glasses more yeah I

364
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,509
appreciate that I mean personally my

365
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,210
feeling is that we've got a reasonably

366
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:22,460
consolidated set of logic the thing that

367
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,750
honestly makes me question of the aspect

368
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,630
of the I question knows does the the

369
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,130
both know where we have both a PSK and

370
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,690
an asymmetric keeper because that's not

371
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,490
there's nothing in the art that does

372
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,220
that right now so it's not clear there's

373
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,110
a case well although it may be used

374
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,220
writing still writing my MLS slides

375
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,689
there might be an application for that

376
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,230
in MLS but it's not anything like the

377
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:45,289
open source software now so that that

378
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,120
thing that I'm it's least clear that

379
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:49,490
there's a use for but at the same time

380
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,989
it's basically zero cost because all the

381
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,179
machinery is there for the the other two

382
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,129
notes so so my inclination is going to

383
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,570
keep things as they are but I'm open to

384
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:58,870
arguments of people are really concerned

385
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,340
about complexity here otherwise I think

386
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,320
Karthik and company and welcome other

387
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,820
analysis or think Karthik is ready to

388
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,549
kind of proceed ahead with doing

389
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,789
verification on on the full construction

390
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:12,649
okay

391
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:14,179
last issue I had which naming came up on

392
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:15,830
list and people didn't like HP key a so

393
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,529
I figured you know I got a couple

394
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:21,080
minutes left give people a chance to sit

395
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:22,820
last chance to come up to Pine

396
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,620
alternative names this is this was the

397
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,889
best we that the authors came up with

398
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,809
and so my proposals like let's call it h

399
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:32,360
PK or let's call it cashier and let's

400
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,428
consider the question done I would

401
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,389
propose we stick with hhp ke but if

402
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:41,539
someone wants to stand up for the

403
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:43,969
alternate there be my guess yeah I love

404
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,960
cashews I don't they care for this name

405
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:51,529
let's just stick with the HP key

406
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:57,879
anything it provided me an expansion

407
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:57,879
we're on okay that's all I got

408
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,790
go down the italics

409
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,020
Stanislav smush laughs Crypt approach

410
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:36,170
and this is a very short overview about

411
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:40,580
MGM mode which has been standardized in

412
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:42,980
Russia s an ad mode in 2019 the

413
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,560
description became available two years

414
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:49,790
ago and the motivation for the

415
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:53,419
development was such that have known

416
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:56,870
security issues face gtam and GTM was

417
00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:01,670
not so widespread so it we have a chance

418
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:05,239
to make something you know but the

419
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:08,570
designers were late to see the contest

420
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,360
so it was not nominated this is only an

421
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:17,210
informative talk without any plans for

422
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,449
adoption at least now so the scheme is

423
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:24,230
on the slide basically an encryption

424
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:27,200
process is counter mode and the

425
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,770
authentication process is kinda like

426
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,510
Gmail from GCM but with a new secret

427
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:40,340
value for each new block of data and

428
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:43,490
with separate counters with separate

429
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,510
nonces and with additional operations at

430
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:50,380
the end of the process so if we consider

431
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:53,590
the function properties that are

432
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:57,490
satisfied for GCM who may say that

433
00:22:53,590 --> 00:23:02,419
except for one except for the sixth one

434
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:05,840
they are inspired for MGM mmm and with

435
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:09,520
the sixth one it is how satisfied

436
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,870
because if we have our knowns

437
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,970
beforehand then we

438
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,610
make these recommendations for austa

439
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:20,330
gated data so the difference is that for

440
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:26,389
GCM we doesn't mean we don't need a

441
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:30,949
nonce to go with the data and for MGM we

442
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:35,860
do so there are some protections against

443
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:40,480
lengthen extension next X is mixing in

444
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:42,729
thanks it end of the process and

445
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,720
protection against predictable

446
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:50,450
collisions of counters do two separate

447
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,590
initial values of counters and different

448
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:57,050
processes of increment so and if we have

449
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,800
a very brief overview of attacks on G

450
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,659
same when we see that for all these

451
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:06,710
kinds of attacks on G same let me see

452
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:10,570
that MGM have has some countermeasures

453
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,910
to protect against the encryption of

454
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:18,080
things here and there in this even

455
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:22,010
process usage of separate and distant a

456
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,449
secret values for each block during a

457
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:29,179
special operation to control fate

458
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:31,309
Saarinen like attacks we have some

459
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:35,570
security bound obtained and the present

460
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:38,210
in this paper shows this light and the

461
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:42,020
last light very shot comparison without

462
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:46,820
a ad modes it can be seen that but for

463
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:50,420
GCM it is right that none of the modes

464
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,820
is better for in for all properties so

465
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,250
there is a subset a certain subset of

466
00:24:52,820 --> 00:25:00,490
properties for which MGM can be

467
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:09,230
preferred so it can be used for some

468
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:11,840
certain applications when its properties

469
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,880
are desired that's all and there are

470
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,129
some backup lights so that you can use

471
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,130
if you want some additional operation

472
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:25,300
one very minor detail GCM also has the

473
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:29,650
interesting property that you could

474
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,820
ah floor Cisco Systems GCM also has the

475
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,650
additional property that you can

476
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,870
actually implement it so that you can

477
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,570
start encrypting before you know the age

478
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,840
of the additional data even how long the

479
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:47,800
initial data is a very minor detail but

480
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:52,600
yeah it's there so instinctive recommend

481
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:55,180
so in fact yes the same in fact has a

482
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,949
lot of good control properties and not

483
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,850
all of them are enumerated in this light

484
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:03,130
and if you'd like any comments about how

485
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:10,000
some of them are or are not satisfied

486
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:12,310
for mjm I'd be happy to comment so seems

487
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,280
like it has some real advantages over

488
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,530
GCM so why are you so which makes me

489
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,530
that it would be better well in some

490
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,540
respect to using a SGC I mean say TLS

491
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:27,460
right dislike so why are you not asking

492
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:30,610
for reduction so I'd like to announce

493
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:36,520
here that I'm not the design MGM so I

494
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:39,010
was the guy who was who conducted some

495
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,770
part of gnosis of it so I can't comment

496
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:45,610
all design ideas of it well the idea was

497
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:49,750
to take all the best from the same but

498
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:55,090
to fight its weak points but of course

499
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:56,340
you know it's slower if to talk about

500
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,199
[Music]

501
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,250
implementations without communism but if

502
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,860
you implement this in parallel you can

503
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:12,130
address each block one by one at the

504
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:14,139
same time in parallel mode hello

505
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:17,380
my question is really about the security

506
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,340
comparison to AAS GCM none of the

507
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:25,560
attacks you cited actually the

508
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:32,230
probability what many attacks you cited

509
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:34,960
break break break free speed security of

510
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,730
a mistress yet they're the the forgery

511
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,440
probability is exactly what it says on

512
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,190
the slides and looks like MGM is

513
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,610
actually slightly

514
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:45,040
works from the answer so less efficient

515
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:51,129
and there are what are the properties

516
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:53,500
you're gaining with MGM over ASG cm so

517
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:59,080
thank you very much for patient yes in

518
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:01,390
fact in addition to the control measures

519
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:06,250
against certain attacks

520
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:10,090
on GGN MGM also has better guilty bounds

521
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:12,720
if we consider synthesis they are on

522
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:17,830
this back up slide so you can see that

523
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,740
for some typical values of length and

524
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:26,100
number of blocks

525
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:30,940
I'm gem is better and also in some

526
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:35,050
positions when some forbidden actions

527
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:38,830
like non 3 use happen it has a little

528
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:41,050
less impactor security so of course the

529
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,260
comparison of the modes can be on the

530
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:48,010
back tables but if we see that in season

531
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,120
two bounds see for which cases MGM looks

532
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:54,070
better

533
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:56,739
we may see some applications when it can

534
00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:01,389
be preferred but I have nothing against

535
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:04,630
it in fact it's just an information

536
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:08,140
about modes that is slower in some sense

537
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,840
but that has some stronger security

538
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:14,610
parameters in other sense but and I

539
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:19,000
would add that for example for fidelity

540
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:22,719
MGM has a little weaker form of the

541
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,840
security maturity bounds because of the

542
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,570
fact that it has to deal with that

543
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,530
additional bit just played to counters

544
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:34,450
for encryption and for authentication so

545
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:37,030
this presentation was not about given

546
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,490
all the details of gem and I think I am

547
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,840
I don't have any time left but I'll be

548
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,840
happy to comment etcetera

549
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,100
yeah so but on your package slide it

550
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:53,040
looks like this and the backup slide you

551
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:59,639
have GCM preferring anything

552
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:02,550
so what for community betters and you

553
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:10,200
seem a little and for simplicity

554
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:13,010
MGM is much better please refer to the

555
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,010
slides

556
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:50,100
thank you so hello everyone I am so

557
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:52,860
corny so up and it is my first idea TF

558
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,419
and I'm grateful to give a presentation

559
00:30:52,860 --> 00:31:03,409
here the today I would talk about

560
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:06,600
pairing friendly curbs so first of all I

561
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:09,300
give a brief overview of this

562
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:13,379
presentation so pairing based

563
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:17,010
cryptography which I will explain later

564
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:20,180
is getting widely used and the security

565
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,620
evaluation of pairing friendly curves

566
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,740
which realize pairing web-based

567
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:31,649
cryptography has been changed due to the

568
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:34,430
attack proposed in 2016 so introducing

569
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:39,360
secure / secure pairing friendly curves

570
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:44,130
the after this attack are required so

571
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:48,110
the the - so the this program the goal

572
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:51,090
of our draft is to show the latest

573
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:54,300
security evaluation of well-known

574
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:57,179
pairing friendly curves and to show the

575
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,879
pyramid new new parameters for pairing

576
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:06,750
friend records with each security level

577
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:09,960
namely 128-bit or higher so

578
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:14,490
our draft is strongly related to the

579
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:17,070
existing existing energy items the

580
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,850
area's signature scheme is one of the

581
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:26,669
examples of pairing based cryptography

582
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:30,889
and behavior signature scheme you uses

583
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:34,170
the hashing true pairing friendly curves

584
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:38,550
specified enhancing to elliptic curves

585
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:45,390
so thankfully this drop drafts refer

586
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:48,149
referring to to our drafts so let me

587
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:51,960
explain the parent with more details

588
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:55,470
about pairing based cryptography pairing

589
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,110
based cryptography is a kind of elliptic

590
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:04,100
curve cryptography the main difference

591
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:08,580
is it utilized the special map called

592
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:12,899
pairing so and thanks to the property of

593
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:16,110
pairing the the cryptography with more

594
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:19,830
more functionality can be can be

595
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:23,300
realized and getting widely used here

596
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:25,580
are the examples of standards in

597
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:30,540
implementations of parent based

598
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:35,370
cryptography for example so so we can

599
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:41,520
see you can see you can see in CDA a

600
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:47,629
specified by TCG Fido and CC C and Intel

601
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:52,050
SGX CID for the remote remote we wrote

602
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:57,170
anonymous attestation which realizes the

603
00:33:52,050 --> 00:34:01,020
attestation in privacy-preserving manner

604
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:04,110
another example is pls signatures which

605
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:09,120
real of which enable signature

606
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:11,909
aggregation and realizes the compression

607
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:16,909
of certificates the signature of

608
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:20,219
certificate chain or the signatures of

609
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:26,790
blockchain and so on

610
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:32,759
more addition the potential potential

611
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:38,719
schemes are proposed in the research

612
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,720
paper and can be realized in the future

613
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:48,060
so like standard elliptic curves the

614
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:52,310
parent based cryptography requires

615
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:55,739
underlying elliptic curves that is the

616
00:34:52,310 --> 00:35:01,200
elliptic curve cryptography like sed sa

617
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:04,290
easy th and is EDD sa require you

618
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:09,230
require underlying elliptic curves

619
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:13,710
defined by NIST safety and CFR G

620
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:18,660
similarly parent based cryptography like

621
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:22,380
BLS signatures required pairing friendly

622
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:26,910
curves and likelike elliptic curve

623
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:30,920
cryptography the security of pairing

624
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:34,230
friendly preparing based cryptography is

625
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:39,869
estimated by the security of parenting

626
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:44,940
friendly curves so let me explain what

627
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:50,640
pairing is so so this this slide

628
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:55,250
contains the the equations but but they

629
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:58,859
appears in only tooth right so okay so

630
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:04,589
pairing a also known as the Polly near

631
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:08,819
map is a map from the group g1 and g2 on

632
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:13,950
to the group GT which satisfies this

633
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:17,970
equation in general g1 a group g1 and g2

634
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:24,899
is a subgroup of elliptic curve groups

635
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:29,160
and GT is submerged creative group of

636
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:32,470
finite field so there are various

637
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:37,180
pairing proposed

638
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:44,529
and optimal egg pairing is is considered

639
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:48,279
to be most efficient and popular to

640
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:54,250
compute pairings absently pairing

641
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:56,619
friendly curbs are introduced example of

642
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:02,170
pairing friend records include being

643
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:08,070
krob pls curve and so on so and BLS

644
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:12,460
curve varies in their embedded degrees

645
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:16,359
so and the parent render occurs varied

646
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:20,140
in their key lengths which determines

647
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:25,390
the security strengths so we called the

648
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:28,960
parent friend curves like so by their

649
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:37,259
car family and key lengths such as the

650
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:37,260
m25 4v n 2 2 2 5 6 and so on

651
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:50,800
so how how can we evaluate the security

652
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:55,089
or pairing frontier curves as shown in

653
00:37:50,800 --> 00:38:00,700
the previous slide pairing the parent

654
00:37:55,089 --> 00:38:06,400
friend records contains three groups G 1

655
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:11,640
and G 2 is chosen by the elliptic curve

656
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,839
groups they are based on a CD LP

657
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,930
elliptic curve discrete logarithm

658
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,930
problem

659
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,790
by contrast

660
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:27,368
GT is chosen by a multiplicative group

661
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:30,490
of all finite field so they are alike

662
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:40,510
they rely on finite field discrete

663
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:44,600
logarithm problem so so we have to

664
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:48,980
consider up so in in the general

665
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:52,220
standard elliptic curve cryptography we

666
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:57,140
can only consider gg1

667
00:38:52,220 --> 00:39:01,490
but in parent preparing based

668
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:06,859
cryptography we have to consider both g1

669
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:11,029
and g2 and GT and the difficult

670
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:15,820
computational the complexity of a CD LP

671
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:21,200
is known as sub exponents of

672
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:26,510
exponentiation and but the complexity of

673
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:35,509
GT is known as sub exponential so we

674
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:45,050
have to consider the difficulty of GT in

675
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:53,170
12 in 2016 the the algorithm to solve FF

676
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:59,360
DLP was proposed so so at first at first

677
00:39:53,170 --> 00:40:02,120
there okay so so due to the attack the

678
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:10,160
security level of all pairing friend

679
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:12,920
recurves has fallen so so we have to

680
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,890
consider the new security evaluation of

681
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:23,150
pairing friendly curves for example

682
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:29,600
after this algorithm being 2 5 6 6 which

683
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:36,920
regarded as 128-bit secure so far fallen

684
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:40,220
to the 100 bits of security now so so

685
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:47,060
introducing new sickness new parameter

686
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:52,970
for 1 128 security level is required

687
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:56,900
so in our draft we select the parameters

688
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,500
for each level low security in terms of

689
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,790
the

690
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:06,050
security and also the efficiency to it

691
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:11,990
since when implemented and how wide they

692
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:19,340
they are used now based based on the

693
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:26,919
this evaluation we are in our draft well

694
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:33,280
the one hand 128 bits of security and

695
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:41,560
256 bits of security are introduced so

696
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:47,540
so so my our our opinion is these two

697
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:53,870
security level sufficient so so we are

698
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:56,990
wondering what what what 192 bits of

699
00:41:53,870 --> 00:42:02,150
security parameters are should be

700
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:05,299
defined so candidate curve is BLS 24 for

701
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:09,940
family and several papers for this

702
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:14,810
security level are proposed but no

703
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:21,860
implementation are published so far so

704
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:26,509
our question is how can we treat one 192

705
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:34,190
bit parameters to answer the question

706
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:37,490
here I give one fact in you us seen NSS

707
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:40,810
which the persecutor parameters for

708
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:44,299
asymmetric cryptography are said to be

709
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:49,640
192 bits of security but on the other

710
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:54,440
hand the status statistics says that the

711
00:42:49,640 --> 00:43:07,370
theorist servers the safety in the tiara

712
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:11,210
servers supports to 250 256 bits of

713
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:15,020
security rather than one

714
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:20,869
ninety-two security so so based on them

715
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:26,920
our consideration is we we can we can

716
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:36,920
select on the 128-bit of security and to

717
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:41,150
256 security so here is the history of

718
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:52,369
our draft we after the initial

719
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:55,640
submission we gave we so many comments

720
00:43:52,369 --> 00:44:02,060
are posted in the mailing list and

721
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:07,098
revised according to them so so if you

722
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:13,849
interested in we we proceed our process

723
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:19,160
that old yeah we'll take one question

724
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:21,880
and after that yeah really quick we're

725
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,640
behind Riyadh Wahby sorry real quick um

726
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,990
so the I emailed you about this but

727
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,790
maybe it's a question for the wider

728
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,799
audience one of the major applications

729
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:33,230
of paring base crypto as was mentioned

730
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,160
the slides are for pairing based

731
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:39,349
arguments snarks BLS 12 3 D 1 is

732
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,299
designed for that purpose none of the

733
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:42,980
other pairing friendly curves being

734
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,720
proposed aren't well known but the bien

735
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,490
curves are but let's ignore those

736
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,759
they're too low security so the question

737
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:54,799
is is it worthwhile to also define 192

738
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:59,119
bit or 256 bit argument friendly pairing

739
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,099
friendly curves it may be no because

740
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,859
already the provers work in Starks is

741
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:06,500
preposterous ly bad and so like 192 or

742
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:16,520
200 pieces acure 'ti is like

743
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:25,619
unbelievably slow so it is not not my

744
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:30,160
our our go to speech by variety many

745
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:35,519
curves so so we have to consider the the

746
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:41,379
the yes the the multiple parameters are

747
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:47,008
good but so so many parameters are not

748
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:51,190
not for implement a turn implementers to

749
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:55,240
implement because they are confused

750
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:57,670
which curve to be implemented yeah

751
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,078
that's totally fair like I said I'm not

752
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,400
aware of any applications that really

753
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:02,499
need that highest security but it's

754
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,880
something to consider because you know

755
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:05,470
it may be that in two years everyone

756
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,309
wants to do it and then oh no we need to

757
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:11,470
add a curve so for example if no one as

758
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:14,019
far as I know no one is actually using

759
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,970
BLS 48 5 anyone that's just like some

760
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:17,558
curve that you know we run on our

761
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:20,140
laptops to bench market or something

762
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,079
right so I don't know maybe there's a

763
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:26,799
VLS 48 587 that is you know that would

764
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:28,240
be reasonable to use with with hearing

765
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:29,440
based arguments in which case maybe it

766
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,129
would be worthwhile to uh standardize

767
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,539
that instead of 581 I don't know I like

768
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,730
I said I don't actually know if people

769
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:38,499
are using 581 and I wouldn't suggest

770
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:42,309
that we get rid of it if they are but if

771
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:43,660
they aren't let's let's keep this on the

772
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:51,489
mailing let's move this to the mailing

773
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:54,399
list really quick ok there apparently

774
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:56,680
there is another option which is optimal

775
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,829
TNF SCO pairings on elliptic curves with

776
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,808
composite embedding degree and there's a

777
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:03,519
link to a paper I knows interested great

778
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:06,910
let's discuss that nonetheless

779
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:09,279
last question I just wanted to thank you

780
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:11,529
for bringing this work to the CFR G I

781
00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:12,999
think it's very important we have a use

782
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:15,160
case for where we're interested in

783
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:16,390
identity based cryptography and we're

784
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,950
going to need to some standardized

785
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:22,558
curves and so I'd like to see let's go

786
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:25,239
forward ok and before we move forward if

787
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,220
it's good to to see if anybody else here

788
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,109
in the room has applications of parent

789
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,299
risk cryptography that they need to so

790
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:34,680
rather than a hum if someone has an

791
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:34,680
application please raise your hand

792
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,640
okay so not many but a few

793
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,460
[Music]

794
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:51,330
the next presentation is going to be

795
00:47:47,460 --> 00:48:07,740
remote and need to be in the control of

796
00:47:51,330 --> 00:48:10,160
the slides but rightly open you want we

797
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,160
can't hear you

798
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:28,930
to present again we'll see if it works

799
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:30,530
no it's a struggle we we can smoke

800
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:37,220
presentations we'll give you another

801
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:40,070
chance later on better yes okay

802
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:47,299
good old leave the page open the page

803
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:50,450
again that's the trick great we can hear

804
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:57,100
you we can hear you and just let us know

805
00:48:50,450 --> 00:49:00,950
when to advance the slides okay let go

806
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:03,290
so thanks a lot for allowing me to

807
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,790
present my work I'm a little para I'm in

808
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:07,550
Paris right now I'm a postdoc at an area

809
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:10,580
and what I'm going to talk about is this

810
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:13,190
paper that I authored which was

811
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:16,130
published at dusk to the conference for

812
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:20,120
symmetric crypto and its consequences

813
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:21,830
regarding to RFC's so I'm going to tell

814
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,470
you what the results presented in this

815
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:26,840
paper is and why it is inconsistent with

816
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:31,970
the claims of the designers of said

817
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,770
algorithms next slide so I'm going to go

818
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,859
quickly over the general context of this

819
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,910
work well what are standards but

820
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,820
obviously I'm going to spend too much

821
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:42,680
time on that and what are s-boxes then

822
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,080
I'm going to talk specifically about the

823
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,049
sbox of these two algorithms and finally

824
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:53,810
tell you why I don't like this S box

825
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:56,780
next slide next slide so the lifetime of

826
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:59,690
an algorithm can be represented in this

827
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,880
way next slide so you have these three

828
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:05,030
faces the design the analysis and the

829
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:07,250
deployment I'm not going to remind you

830
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:11,240
what the actors are I believe you're all

831
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:13,910
familiar with them next slide so when we

832
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,910
design a new algorithm we come up with a

833
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:18,259
scope statement and we write down its

834
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:22,520
specification and much more importantly

835
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:25,520
we make choices during the design and we

836
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:29,570
justify them so we explain them and we

837
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:31,788
justify them in the specification and we

838
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:34,759
also do a first security analysis

839
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:39,229
next slide so we put this all in a

840
00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:41,119
publication and then the public so the

841
00:50:39,229 --> 00:50:44,149
general general academic community we

842
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:47,179
try and break said algorithms next slide

843
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:48,788
if we managed we put it in the trash if

844
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:51,289
not next slide

845
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:52,759
eventually the algorithm the algorithms

846
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:55,999
are trusted and they are standardized

847
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:58,039
and then they will be implemented in

848
00:50:55,999 --> 00:51:01,879
actual products until a new attack is

849
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:03,979
found hopefully not but perhaps this is

850
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,259
the ideal world and indeed it actually

851
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:09,189
happens in this way in many cases but

852
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:11,509
not always next slide

853
00:51:09,189 --> 00:51:14,538
sometimes we have an algorithm which is

854
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:16,489
designed by unknowns which is

855
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:17,989
standardized right away and we don't

856
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:19,969
have the publication with all the

857
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:22,099
explanation of all the design choices in

858
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:24,829
this context and as you can see there is

859
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:27,319
no trust anymore on these slides next

860
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:29,479
slide the problem we have in this case

861
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:32,449
is that there could be hidden defects in

862
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:34,368
the algorithm since for the analysis we

863
00:51:32,449 --> 00:51:37,189
can not leverage all this public

864
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:40,039
information all this explanation about

865
00:51:37,189 --> 00:51:41,868
the design choices etc we could overlook

866
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:44,029
some aspect of the design and miss a

867
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:45,859
flaw but the flow could be intentional

868
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:48,019
or not it could be a perfectly honest

869
00:51:45,859 --> 00:51:50,449
mistake that we still cannot see because

870
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:57,069
we don't have this information next

871
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:59,869
slide an sbox is a very popular

872
00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:02,299
component of symmetric algorithms it's

873
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:04,130
usually the only nonlinear one so an

874
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:06,109
sbox is a small nonlinear function which

875
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:08,749
is so small that you can specify it

876
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:10,788
using its lookup table so typical size

877
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:13,368
are four or eight each and they can be

878
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:17,059
designed in very different ways so this

879
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:18,349
is a survey I'm majoring my PhD there

880
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:19,659
are many different structures I'm not

881
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:25,369
going to go over them

882
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:27,380
next slide how do we justify the choice

883
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,329
of an sbox

884
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,369
we can just look at what the designers

885
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:34,279
of the alias' did so this page you can

886
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:37,159
see was taken from the document with

887
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:39,409
your URL I put in my slide it was

888
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:41,479
written by the AES designers and as you

889
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:44,059
can see they have first appeared design

890
00:52:41,479 --> 00:52:45,700
goal so they want their s box to be

891
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:49,010
invertible etc

892
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:51,140
then they explain the motivation for the

893
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,609
specific solution they chose so it

894
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,788
turned out there was a paper explaining

895
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:59,569
that the inverse was very nice so they

896
00:52:55,789 --> 00:53:01,279
went with that they also identified the

897
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:02,808
possible issue with this approach which

898
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:04,789
is that the ad break expression could be

899
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:08,000
too simple and this could be an issue so

900
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:10,640
they found a way to remedy that and then

901
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,160
finally they described the process they

902
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,410
use to choose the actual sbox of the

903
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,359
cipher the one they actually used so

904
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:19,970
this is how it should be done and how it

905
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:25,450
is often done this is not how it was

906
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:25,450
done for these two algorithms slide

907
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,319
these two algorithms

908
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:32,630
it's the hash functions three bug and

909
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,089
the block cipher quiz Nicci hash

910
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:38,750
function and the block cipher both are

911
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:42,710
standards in Russia both are RFC's

912
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:44,390
although not from the CFR G the chair's

913
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:47,210
insisted on that they are from the

914
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:49,940
independent stream they were designed by

915
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:52,099
the TC 26 along with the company and the

916
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:56,270
TC 26 is a committee which is supervised

917
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:57,980
by the FSB what matters to me for now is

918
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:01,150
that both of these algorithms use the

919
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:07,069
same a t-test box which they denoted by

920
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:09,020
slide over time so first this algorithm

921
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:10,670
these algorithms were published by the

922
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:16,009
ghost so the Russian standardizing

923
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:18,980
agency and as RFC's after that next

924
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:20,930
slide we looked at them with my then

925
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,000
colleagues from Luxembourg and we found

926
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:27,470
two decompositions of this S box so we

927
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
found two ways of writing it which was

928
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,439
very puzzling for us we found the first

929
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,329
one and then we found the second one

930
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,309
which was completely different so the

931
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:37,369
conclusion of these two papers was that

932
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:40,730
this S box was very mysterious and there

933
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:42,910
was more to it than we could find after

934
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:45,619
that next slide

935
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:49,629
it was standardized tree bug was

936
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:53,029
certified standardized by ISO after that

937
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,650
I found the final decompositions that's

938
00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:58,609
the one in the paper I mentioned on my

939
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:59,450
very first slide the this is the final

940
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:01,370
decomposition because

941
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,990
it explains the other two the first to

942
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:06,200
the competitions are just side effects

943
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:08,419
of this one and it's much simpler so at

944
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,240
that point problem solved that's how

945
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:14,360
they beat the sbox or so I thought

946
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,790
next slide the discussions are still

947
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,170
ongoing at ISO so they were supposed to

948
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,560
standardize whose net cheek but they

949
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:23,690
decided instead postpone the decision

950
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,279
for six months until they had the time

951
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:29,870
to figure out the consequences of my

952
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:32,210
work and next slide they would have to

953
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:33,950
take a decision in September so I

954
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:37,520
mentioned I saw a lot here because

955
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:43,250
actually there were like a side channel

956
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:49,460
as you will see next slide so why do I

957
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:51,740
not like said sbox slide that's what we

958
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:53,210
know about them this is all the

959
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,819
information that was provided by their

960
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:56,960
designers the lookup table it's all you

961
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,790
need if you want to implement the

962
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,770
ciphers or the Alameda cipher or the

963
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:03,520
hash function but if you want to

964
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:06,160
evaluated security it's not sufficient

965
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,170
next slide

966
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,060
however during discussions that I saw

967
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:12,920
the designers of three began whose

968
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:15,200
Nietzsche did provide them some

969
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,080
information at ISO it's behind closed

970
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,080
doors but this information was leaked so

971
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,730
I have put the URLs on my slides and in

972
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,220
these documents you can read what is on

973
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:27,470
the slide namely that the sbox PI was

974
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:30,140
obtained by so the random search no

975
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:33,830
secret structure was enforced during its

976
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:37,250
construction this is wrong what I have

977
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:39,560
proved in this paper at dusk was that Pi

978
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:44,320
was actually described by these very

979
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:47,630
simple equations so these the designers

980
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:50,150
defend themselves now saying basically

981
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:51,770
what is written on the second block at

982
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,480
the same time it is obvious that for any

983
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,310
transformation a lot of representations

984
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,380
are possible

985
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:59,870
basically what they say is that yes Pi

986
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:03,590
has the structure it is impossible to

987
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:05,650
deny you can just check it however had

988
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:08,150
they picked the next day's box in the

989
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:11,380
generation process I would have found

990
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:14,369
another structure in it this is wrong

991
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:16,229
next slide

992
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:18,180
to see why it's wrong we need to come up

993
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:22,618
with a sensible definition of simplicity

994
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:26,279
that we can still evaluate so that's

995
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:30,809
exactly what we did there are about two

996
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:32,729
to the 1684 8-bit permutations so in any

997
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:34,289
given language you're going to need at

998
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:36,180
least one thousand six hundred eighty

999
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:38,609
four bits be able to represent all of

1000
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:41,069
them and most of them will have a very

1001
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:44,549
long representation the number of those

1002
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:46,950
boxes with a short representation is at

1003
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:51,960
most the number of bit strings of this

1004
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:55,049
length next slide and this is an

1005
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,660
implementation of Pi it's C not super

1006
00:57:55,049 --> 00:58:03,799
readable C but perfectly compatible C

1007
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:06,930
and it's only 1155 bits long next slide

1008
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:09,930
in fact we invited the code golf

1009
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:11,279
community at Stack Exchange to come up

1010
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,649
with the best implementations they could

1011
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:18,059
find so the shortest and one of them

1012
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:22,589
found by one odds-on is only 624 bits

1013
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:24,299
long next slide the probability that for

1014
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:26,489
a random s box is the one that you have

1015
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:27,180
obtained by a random search is that

1016
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:28,710
simple

1017
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:32,249
meaning that it can be implemented by

1018
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:35,910
your program is short is that most two

1019
00:58:32,249 --> 00:58:39,238
to the minus 1,000 and that's assuming

1020
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:43,739
all bit strings correspond to the

1021
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:46,559
umbrella C to the amd64 bit code

1022
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:48,150
implementing a permutation it's not it's

1023
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,989
wrong it's a very it's not a tight

1024
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:53,670
estimate at all it's an upper bound and

1025
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:56,549
this upper bound on the probability is 2

1026
00:58:53,670 --> 00:59:01,769
to the minus 1,000 which I hope you will

1027
00:58:56,549 --> 00:59:08,069
agree is very low next slide so where do

1028
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:09,988
we go from here slide this statement by

1029
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:12,749
the designers that they had not enforced

1030
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:15,420
any structure in their algorithm cannot

1031
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:17,218
be reconciled with the shortness of

1032
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,529
their implementation of the

1033
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:21,569
implementation of the rest box it is not

1034
00:59:19,529 --> 00:59:25,799
possible to generate an S box at random

1035
00:59:21,569 --> 00:59:27,240
and obtain in the output something with

1036
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:29,640
this simple structure

1037
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,160
by chance the probability is so low that

1038
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:35,839
it's young negligible we're happy with

1039
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:41,790
256 bits of security here we have 1,000

1040
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:43,380
next slide I think what this means is

1041
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,770
that the designers have provided

1042
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,970
misleading information for the

1043
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:50,820
cryptographers who wanted to analyze

1044
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:53,279
their design at first they said nothing

1045
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,600
which is not the best practice and then

1046
00:59:53,280 --> 01:00:01,290
at ISO they provided wrong information

1047
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,420
next slide I don't need to tell you how

1048
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:06,480
hard it is to do the security analysis

1049
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:08,310
of an algorithm even if we have all the

1050
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,230
data in the world from the designers and

1051
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:14,279
all the goodwill from the designers if

1052
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:16,830
we have not just an absence of

1053
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,350
information but wrong information it's

1054
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:21,390
even more difficult and there is I can't

1055
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:23,670
think of any good reason to complete

1056
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:27,629
gate further the task of external

1057
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:30,030
cryptographers next slide that's why I

1058
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:32,310
think the designers of these algorithms

1059
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:34,619
cannot be trusted these algorithms

1060
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:36,630
cannot be trusted and why I believe they

1061
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,990
should be deprecated I don't think we

1062
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:43,070
want to have Arabs RFPs for those and

1063
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,069
that's it for me thank you

1064
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:58,170
okay any questions I agree we should

1065
01:00:54,569 --> 01:01:02,190
stop using them but really encourage

1066
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:06,000
people to find out how they go I assume

1067
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:08,940
that the some jiggering going on and I

1068
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,190
really be interested to see how it could

1069
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:14,339
be exploited which will be the next part

1070
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:18,540
but we don't need to see the exploit in

1071
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:19,558
order to stop using it we'll cut the

1072
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,390
line here okay

1073
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:24,270
your veneer so I guess you don't want me

1074
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:25,589
to write using this check for TLS ting

1075
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:28,829
okay

1076
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:30,690
every person is saying that either is

1077
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:32,940
standardizing it and they are making the

1078
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:35,579
decision in September suppose they do

1079
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,470
who needs to use this what does it mean

1080
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:42,180
that is the PI server is standardizing

1081
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:47,339
it I encourage you to watch a talk given

1082
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:49,799
by a tool Louis at real world crypto

1083
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:52,049
this year where he talks about the

1084
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:53,790
impact of an Isis realization in this

1085
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:56,700
case he was worried about Simon inspect

1086
01:01:53,790 --> 01:02:00,569
the ciphers from the NSA but a nice

1087
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:03,089
Western realization can have more

1088
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:04,710
consequences in the sense that it could

1089
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:06,450
be enforceable in some cases to use

1090
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:08,040
these algorithms like to force people to

1091
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:10,680
use these algorithms if I'm not mistaken

1092
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:13,170
but I thought explains it well in this

1093
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:23,940
real real world crypto presentation it's

1094
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:26,030
on YouTube I am a little concerned about

1095
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,619
the things you've raised here but I also

1096
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:34,290
feel like we've heard this story in the

1097
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:36,990
1970s when Marty Hellman said hey

1098
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:39,329
there's something funny with these des s

1099
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:41,129
boxes don't know what it is but it

1100
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:44,280
doesn't feels right there's a cemetry in

1101
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:46,020
there and then it turned out that that

1102
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,970
symmetry was put there to defeat

1103
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:50,309
differential cryptanalysis it just

1104
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:51,618
wasn't publicly known yet I don't know

1105
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:56,160
if that's what's going on here or

1106
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:57,869
something else but you don't know you

1107
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,690
just know something smells funny right

1108
01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:00,460
is that

1109
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:02,200
yes there is a big difference also as

1110
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:04,030
far as I know in the case of the des the

1111
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,230
NSA never said anything that's what they

1112
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,690
tend to do if you talk with them at

1113
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:09,670
conferences they don't say anything in

1114
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,740
this case they said something which was

1115
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:13,000
wrong I believe that a big difference I

1116
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:15,910
agree with that

1117
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:21,250
the difference was the ISO registry

1118
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:25,270
didn't exist back but as well as much

1119
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:30,010
live release many sense for your work

1120
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:33,940
I'm not a designer of software company

1121
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:35,520
in Russia that uses these algorithms in

1122
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:39,040
the software that is provided for

1123
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:41,770
government and its proponent and so I'm

1124
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:44,290
really very proud of you that you're

1125
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:48,030
spending so much time on agencies

1126
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:52,420
because really an algorithm that is used

1127
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:56,109
must be analyzed thoroughly but I have

1128
01:03:52,420 --> 01:04:00,190
to mention two issues with his lights

1129
01:03:56,109 --> 01:04:02,410
first of it's that absence of public

1130
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:05,230
information before standardization is

1131
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:10,359
not fully correct even your in your

1132
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:12,430
paper you size papers of 2014 and for

1133
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:15,520
three book moreover it was a public

1134
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:19,029
contest I agree that it was not as

1135
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:22,750
public as it could be worldwide but

1136
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:25,530
least was public with some prizes and a

1137
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:30,069
lot of people outside of Russia

1138
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:32,290
participated but in any case I totally

1139
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:36,369
agree with you that any analysis and

1140
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:39,700
currently should be done and about your

1141
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:43,599
point about the conclusion in fact I

1142
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:45,598
really want you to find your find some

1143
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:49,240
time to continue your efforts because

1144
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:52,599
any concerns and any questions about

1145
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:55,149
structures must be answered but if you

1146
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:58,329
be honest if you would find something

1147
01:04:55,150 --> 01:05:00,940
like Ferguson and zoom off in 2007 when

1148
01:04:58,329 --> 01:05:04,599
there was a statement like if the

1149
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:07,780
designer see you such disagree soon then

1150
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:10,240
as a sergeant I can be mounted then if

1151
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:12,610
you had some statements a statement then

1152
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,470
the question about it will be state

1153
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:18,160
Russia will be stating and I saw

1154
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:21,430
everywhere but if you just say that

1155
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:26,140
there are some some concerns and even

1156
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:30,279
the paper that you say a paper of silly

1157
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:33,970
old they also say it all says that there

1158
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:36,610
are quite different sins and the cosets

1159
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:38,709
is the only word that is in common so

1160
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:42,070
you say that there are some structures

1161
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:44,350
and some another structure can be used

1162
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:46,240
for exploit but they're really different

1163
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:49,630
structures it's like saying that when

1164
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:52,689
you use drbg use elliptic curves and it

1165
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:56,830
has by door and then easy to say has a

1166
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:57,400
bell - - so of course you have very good

1167
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,500
results

1168
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,710
and they want you to be to continue it

1169
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:06,220
but they don't show anything about

1170
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:08,740
attack or back door now but of course

1171
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:11,140
you should continue or can't it will

1172
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:14,830
will be very good if you will find some

1173
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:18,670
some some attack or some method we'll be

1174
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:23,100
happy to discuss it with you and maybe

1175
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:28,810
you I hope that NASA will be found and

1176
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:32,799
if not then it's just concern a question

1177
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:35,440
why such site property who are not

1178
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,380
disclosed or if it was known by

1179
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,680
designers but it's there's no reason to

1180
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:45,100
say about mega door or some attack it's

1181
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:47,169
just some properties so I never claimed

1182
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,730
I had an attack actually was always here

1183
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,840
at least the paper I hope it's clear

1184
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:52,330
that I do not have an attack that

1185
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:56,680
exploit these properties

1186
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:57,700
I do not that's that's a fact and yes

1187
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,049
there has been some external treat

1188
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,299
analysis of his algorithms especially

1189
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:03,400
streebek there was indeed a three-block

1190
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:05,050
competition but at the time the

1191
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,030
cryptographers could not also check the

1192
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:10,210
impact of the structure of the sbox they

1193
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:11,560
had the designers chose they could

1194
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:12,970
analyze the cipher from its

1195
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:16,120
specification but that's all they had to

1196
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:17,980
work with and i think it's a bad thing i

1197
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,230
teach it i think should have had all the

1198
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:22,170
information at hand from the get-go I

1199
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:25,940
shouldn't have to spend three years

1200
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:32,450
finding it by hand

1201
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:34,430
and also so yes indeed so I didn't talk

1202
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:36,160
about it in my in this talk because I

1203
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:38,330
didn't have time in because it was

1204
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:41,240
perhaps a bit too it would take me too

1205
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:44,630
far but the fact is that this sbox

1206
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:47,689
interacts in a non-trivial way with who

1207
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:49,700
sets of the subfield so it interacts

1208
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:51,980
with additive Co sets which is exactly

1209
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:54,620
what we are used so it's not completely

1210
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:56,570
different health of the pattern involves

1211
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:59,270
additive Co sets which is exactly what

1212
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:01,970
was used in the back door of cereal and

1213
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:03,880
many the other half is indeed

1214
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:08,480
multiplicative coset which is different

1215
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,280
that's also a fact at the same time the

1216
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,560
designers of three bug also did not

1217
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,990
disclose the way the linear layer was

1218
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:20,660
built and the way this linear layer is

1219
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:22,189
built is using matrices with

1220
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,680
coefficients in the finite field and

1221
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:26,108
it's the same finite field as the one

1222
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:29,300
used to design the sbox

1223
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:31,310
so the linear layer also interacts in a

1224
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:33,470
non-trivial way with the sub field and

1225
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,670
its multiplicative Co sets and that's

1226
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:36,859
something we don't understand right now

1227
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:38,840
so I cannot exploit this for an attack

1228
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:40,660
again I want to be very clear on that I

1229
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,130
do not have an attack I can't decipher

1230
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:45,649
but it's more than just finding a

1231
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:47,150
specific structure and not liking it I

1232
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:49,129
have good reasons not to like it

1233
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:52,069
and one of these roots one of these

1234
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:53,540
reasons is because again it interacts

1235
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:55,279
with the subfields in a way which we

1236
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,479
don't understand so well and we don't

1237
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,569
know how it interacts with a linear

1238
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:01,939
layer but the main reason which has

1239
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:03,649
little to do with the specifics of the

1240
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:06,620
property is indeed the fact that the

1241
01:09:03,649 --> 01:09:09,349
designers did not disclose it what I

1242
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:13,279
have established what I have proved with

1243
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:15,920
this good god thing is that it had to be

1244
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:18,290
put there by someone such a structure

1245
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,140
does not happen by chance I don't know

1246
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:26,210
who else someone is I don't know why but

1247
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:27,140
it was good there on purpose we've got

1248
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:30,260
to move on to the next presentation

1249
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:31,609
we're well behind so I mean is this

1250
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,960
going to be a very short question or

1251
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:35,470
something that can be taken to the rest

1252
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,109
most of the comments

1253
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:42,370
made by previous commanders so I have

1254
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:47,559
her just a couple of notices one is that

1255
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:51,160
I see logically in the statement then if

1256
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:55,020
something can be effectively presented

1257
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:59,230
in computational meaning it could be it

1258
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:03,430
should be not taken by chance or by any

1259
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:07,379
other things that's right I I do not see

1260
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:10,720
logic in in that another one color

1261
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:14,410
coincide it is that I would like to have

1262
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:18,510
a great thank to the presenter to their

1263
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:21,460
bringing attention to the possible

1264
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:24,340
effectively computational representation

1265
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:27,940
of the ends boxes but developers of the

1266
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:30,100
strivers are very thankful to you for

1267
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:32,320
that and for atella

1268
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:36,130
bringing the attention of code golfers

1269
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:38,559
though they're having more efficient

1270
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:41,380
computation or representations which is

1271
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,690
extremely important in constrained

1272
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:45,100
environments thank you okay thank you

1273
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:46,629
and we'll thank you for your

1274
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:53,860
presentation unless you hiked all that

1275
01:10:46,630 --> 01:11:03,460
you're okay okay good yeah let's try to

1276
01:10:53,860 --> 01:11:06,099
keep it fast so we can okay this is a

1277
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:07,480
quick update on hatch the curve one of

1278
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,250
the updates appears on this slide I'm a

1279
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:11,080
new author and so is Armando

1280
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:14,830
Rhonda's put in a ton of work so he's

1281
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:16,780
not here but thank him so in general we

1282
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:18,280
can think of hash to curve the way that

1283
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:20,200
we're describing at the document in kind

1284
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,570
of three steps the first step is hashing

1285
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,639
from an arbitrary string to an element

1286
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,870
of a finite field the second is going

1287
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,160
from the element the finite field to a

1288
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:28,720
point on the elliptic curve and then the

1289
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,580
third is clearing the cofactor for any

1290
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,620
curve that has a non unity cofactor and

1291
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:35,410
so the goal is to make all three of

1292
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:37,809
these steps constant time so in

1293
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:39,130
particular there is no hash and test or

1294
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:40,960
hunt-and-peck or ever you want to call

1295
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:41,260
it in this draft that is a conscious

1296
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,300
choice

1297
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:44,380
we don't think people should use it

1298
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,930
there are fast algorithms for

1299
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:48,190
essentially every curve so let's talk a

1300
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,120
little bit about the changes hash to

1301
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:51,669
base so

1302
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,760
we've added in this new draft explicit

1303
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:56,770
security requirements this means how you

1304
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,990
choose the hash function how many bytes

1305
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:00,790
you extract from the input string the

1306
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:02,380
goal here is to get collision resistance

1307
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:06,160
and to get uniform distribution over the

1308
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:08,350
field we've made very recently a change

1309
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,059
to build the hash to base from HK DF the

1310
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:11,740
idea there is to defend us defend

1311
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:13,900
ourselves against cases where the hash

1312
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:16,179
function underlying that is less than

1313
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:18,219
perfect one thing and this was a

1314
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:19,540
suggestion from Co tech we and Sergey

1315
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:21,700
gorbunov who are working on the pls

1316
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:23,650
signatures is what we call pre hash for

1317
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,510
free the idea here is hash to base is

1318
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:27,339
designed in such a way that no matter

1319
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:29,710
what you do you only have to pass over

1320
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:32,800
the input string once so what this means

1321
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:35,710
is that if an invoking protocol forgets

1322
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,020
to or it doesn't want to define a pre

1323
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:40,000
hash mode that's okay you can still get

1324
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,370
the efficiency of only passing over the

1325
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,640
input once and finally we've recently

1326
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:46,930
had a domain separation guidelines

1327
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,930
domain separation in general is not a

1328
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:53,410
magic bullet but it can save you and it

1329
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:55,000
can be useful in you know proving

1330
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:56,800
properties about sort of compositions of

1331
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,170
protocols so our hope is that people

1332
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,690
will use it proactively and we give some

1333
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:05,980
guidelines for how to do that as far as

1334
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:07,929
the Maps so this is sort of the the

1335
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:12,370
bread and butter of the hash to curve

1336
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:14,170
this is all the algebra is so one a few

1337
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:15,910
things that we've done in this draft one

1338
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:18,010
we specify how to choose the sine of the

1339
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:19,599
resulting point this is different than

1340
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:21,250
what was going on before and the goal

1341
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,870
here is we don't want to have to tell

1342
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:24,760
implementers this is the way you must

1343
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:25,809
compute square root because of course

1344
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,740
square root can give you two possible

1345
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:31,420
values implement it however you want we

1346
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,800
can you will still be able to

1347
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:35,170
interoperate with other people as long

1348
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,090
as you fix the sign up at the end we've

1349
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:38,590
explicitly handled all the exceptional

1350
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:40,000
cases or at least that's the intention

1351
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,800
perhaps or something we didn't that we

1352
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,220
missed but if we have please bring that

1353
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,840
to our attention we've removed the swu

1354
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:48,970
algorithm in favor of a generalized

1355
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:51,310
version the simplified SW so the

1356
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:53,530
simplified version is faster and it

1357
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:55,690
covers now all the same curves let's

1358
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:57,849
push talk about IPR to the end because

1359
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:59,500
there may be something now we've also

1360
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:01,090
unified the way that elliegator 2 is

1361
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,770
done for the Montgomery and Edwards

1362
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:04,030
curves the goal here is

1363
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,130
if somebody is implementing something

1364
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:08,320
over say curfew fare 1/9 it'll be

1365
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:09,490
possible to for you know one

1366
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,049
implementation to work on the Edwards

1367
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:13,090
curve and another implementation to work

1368
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:14,560
on the Montgomery curve and that's okay

1369
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:16,990
you can still arrive at the same answer

1370
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,730
in an efficient way and finally we've

1371
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:20,290
added it's a new map for pairing

1372
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,629
friendly and some other curves based on

1373
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:26,590
some work that Dan banana I will present

1374
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:29,230
it chess in about a month not much to

1375
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:31,150
talk about in in the clear cofactor so

1376
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:32,889
I'll jump right to the Suites so the

1377
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,839
idea of Suites is we're trying to give

1378
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,240
people sort of a menu like if you just

1379
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,010
want to you know pop into the into the

1380
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,889
document you have your curve already in

1381
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:43,450
mind here's how to do it so right now

1382
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:44,860
we're specifying sweets for then this

1383
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:46,690
curves and you can see them on the slide

1384
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:49,389
there and the goal is we're gonna

1385
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:51,429
provide for all of these sweets sort of

1386
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:52,810
constant time optimized pseudocode and

1387
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,400
of course constant time with the proviso

1388
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:56,680
that all the underlying primitives are

1389
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,150
constant time that's out of scope for

1390
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,680
the document so for example we're not

1391
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,940
going to tell you how to do constant

1392
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,880
time multiplication because you know but

1393
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:05,710
know that better than I do certainly but

1394
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,690
the assumption is as long as you have

1395
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:11,380
those the result will be constant time

1396
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:13,660
and we're gonna like I said we're gonna

1397
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:15,670
give that for all the sweets there are

1398
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:17,050
some other planned additions so one

1399
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,730
thing we need to do is cover more curves

1400
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,990
we'll certainly cover all the curves

1401
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:21,309
from appearing friendly drafts because

1402
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:23,440
that's a place where people really tend

1403
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:25,420
to be attached a curve and another thing

1404
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,629
that we're considering is sort of a way

1405
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:30,160
of helping people to sort of choose the

1406
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:31,300
this week that we would have chosen if

1407
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,590
we were thinking about the curve that

1408
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:35,080
you're thinking about but we didn't

1409
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:36,490
think about for some reason so that

1410
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,190
brings us to the kind of open questions

1411
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:40,540
a couple that I have are are there any

1412
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:43,599
curves that people want to see covered

1413
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:44,740
aren't currently specific question are

1414
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,350
there any super singular curves that

1415
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:50,320
people care about we could imagine

1416
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:53,560
putting some in just for funds perhaps

1417
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,790
like seaside related curves but as far

1418
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,440
as we can tell there isn't much going on

1419
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:58,230
that actually has a lot of use of this

1420
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,690
so not obvious that we should be

1421
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:03,849
incorporating it I PR concerns this is

1422
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:06,160
going to become a big thing I'm sure so

1423
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,350
it appears that the e cart algorithm is

1424
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:10,139
covered by look I'm not a patent lawyer

1425
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:12,130
so this is only I'm reporting what

1426
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:14,380
jornatha has talked about on the list

1427
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:16,599
thank him by the way for good work there

1428
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:20,230
so ecard appears to be calm

1429
01:16:16,599 --> 01:16:21,820
covered by a patent simplified SW also

1430
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:24,159
appears to be mentioned in a patent but

1431
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,829
in a much narrower way again with the

1432
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:29,500
proviso that I'm nothing like a lawyer

1433
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:32,049
so we need some fallback solution one

1434
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:33,909
possibility is to bring back SW u and

1435
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:36,099
we've talked about this on the list I

1436
01:16:33,909 --> 01:16:37,629
have an alternative proposal which is to

1437
01:16:36,099 --> 01:16:40,270
use the sort of the shallow end of

1438
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:43,810
boosting map which is what underlies

1439
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:44,949
that's the SMW and SW u so sorry to cool

1440
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:47,469
us we're not trying to kick you out the

1441
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:50,500
idea is it's possible actually to get an

1442
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:52,179
even more general map than SW u with

1443
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,159
essentially the same performance and

1444
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:56,980
actually a simpler interface

1445
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:58,150
so whereas SW you kind of breaks the

1446
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:00,549
abstraction that we're trying to build

1447
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:03,219
for map to curve shallow and bundle

1448
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:05,469
esteem me you know works with the same

1449
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:07,360
interface so from our perspective it's

1450
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:09,520
strictly better but of course we want to

1451
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,598
hear your feedback on that so at this

1452
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,639
point I'd love to hear any feedback

1453
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:15,070
anything that we're not covering right

1454
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:16,840
now any bugs in the document actually

1455
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:18,190
thank you Dan Harkins who has already

1456
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:23,980
pointed out some bugs in the document

1457
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:25,299
it's getting better thank you okay all

1458
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:29,949
right thanks for the thanks Scott and

1459
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:32,800
let's move on to the pake yeah just

1460
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:35,348
physical questions so are you thinking

1461
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:38,139
it's one more revision a couple of

1462
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:39,310
revisions before last call or it

1463
01:17:38,139 --> 01:17:41,380
certainly depends on how we count

1464
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:45,099
revisions and hey we can do we could

1465
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:47,139
probably crush it all into one just yeah

1466
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:48,849
in principle it's pretty close basically

1467
01:17:47,139 --> 01:17:50,560
it seems like it's pretty close there's

1468
01:17:48,849 --> 01:17:52,540
organizational concerns and clarity

1469
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,250
concerns that we're learning about and

1470
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,840
we have to cover a few more curves but I

1471
01:17:54,250 --> 01:18:01,530
don't think there are huge changes

1472
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,530
coming thank you so

1473
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:21,440
so these dozen Flav again

1474
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,570
now that's every secretary so we have

1475
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,178
this ongoing process of that selection

1476
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:30,199
process and I'd like to give an overview

1477
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:33,260
of our current status so it all started

1478
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:36,619
at ATF 103 when there was a decision to

1479
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:38,749
start the process to involve review

1480
01:18:36,619 --> 01:18:42,499
panel to come up with recommendations

1481
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:46,190
and when does it was a decision to try

1482
01:18:42,499 --> 01:18:48,920
to select zero more one or more packs to

1483
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:51,228
recommend to the community so we have

1484
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:56,349
the following timeline on stage 2 stage

1485
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:59,179
1 we had our call for candidates and

1486
01:18:56,349 --> 01:19:01,940
first-round discussions of the list of

1487
01:18:59,179 --> 01:19:05,479
questions to be asked and stage 2 we

1488
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:07,940
have collected we collected responses

1489
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:11,530
from the designers of the protocols for

1490
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:14,839
all positions of RFC

1491
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:17,150
8125 with the requirements for packs and

1492
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:22,550
all additional questions that we

1493
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:27,228
collected at stage 1 now we have four

1494
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:30,289
stages in the future and the stages are

1495
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:32,840
about reviewing first of all we will

1496
01:19:30,289 --> 01:19:35,150
have call for viewers for the enumerated

1497
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:39,199
questions because some of them are not

1498
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:41,299
about security assessment and so they

1499
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:43,669
are better to be done not by panel

1500
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:46,699
members but and by independent people

1501
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:49,070
who know a lot of particular stuff

1502
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:51,169
related to these questions then the

1503
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:54,429
reviewers make this rare analysis and

1504
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:57,949
then review panel members provide

1505
01:19:54,429 --> 01:20:01,639
overall reviews for each candidate and

1506
01:19:57,949 --> 01:20:03,558
in the end say for the chairs discuss

1507
01:20:01,639 --> 01:20:05,959
reviews and try to make some

1508
01:20:03,559 --> 01:20:08,959
recommendations and if they're ready to

1509
01:20:05,959 --> 01:20:13,280
make some recommendations then at ATF

1510
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:15,829
106 some acts are selected and a

1511
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:19,159
production of document like

1512
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:21,880
recommendations for a sophisticated key

1513
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:24,438
agreement in ATF protocols are

1514
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,210
established with reflection of the

1515
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:28,640
results of the selection

1516
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:30,770
some important recommendations for

1517
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:32,900
publications and at the same time

1518
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:36,440
documents in the usage of the specs in

1519
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:40,879
the protocols can be developed so what

1520
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:43,250
we have now we have very good list of

1521
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,790
nominations we have eight nominations

1522
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:49,130
for four balanced for for augmented and

1523
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:51,350
this are really strong candidates I

1524
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:55,010
think we are very in a good position now

1525
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:57,920
here on stage one we are also collected

1526
01:20:55,010 --> 01:21:00,080
a number of questions to be asked they

1527
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,050
are about shoot requirements about wit

1528
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,240
agility about applications of PAC about

1529
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:07,520
performance about security assessment

1530
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:10,040
about security proof and about

1531
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:13,220
recommendations for security rates usage

1532
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:16,310
the last one is very important because a

1533
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:19,250
lot of packs can be broken in because of

1534
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:23,180
very small problems with implementation

1535
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:27,290
so this kind of questions is really

1536
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:29,330
important on stage to get elected their

1537
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:32,620
sponsors from all the authors and many

1538
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:36,200
thanks to all all source to provide in

1539
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:38,590
providing their responses in time and

1540
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:42,380
their words are sponsors for

1541
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:44,150
requirements of RFC 8125 and the

1542
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:48,710
opinions and the equations collected at

1543
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:52,309
stage 1 so there's pauses for all eight

1544
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:55,360
protocols what's next so now we have

1545
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:59,240
starting to do the reviews and the

1546
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:02,330
current stage which may be the most

1547
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:06,139
important one is about call for

1548
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:09,440
independent reviewers for specific

1549
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:12,500
questions that we have first of all two

1550
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,960
questions that in my opinion are the

1551
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:19,250
most complicated ones are about

1552
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:23,330
integration of each candidate into TLS

1553
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:26,840
1.3 can shake and into equity to about

1554
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:29,990
the less 1.3 we heard a lot of drugs

1555
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:33,200
documents and discussions and earlier at

1556
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:36,629
IETF 104 I made a presentation in

1557
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:40,858
progress overview of existing documents

1558
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:44,999
and we must take all this into account

1559
01:22:40,859 --> 01:22:48,090
and you really need people who really

1560
01:22:44,999 --> 01:22:50,789
know to illness and can prepare their

1561
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:53,459
reviews and spend some time off for

1562
01:22:50,789 --> 01:22:58,050
reviewing each packs considering

1563
01:22:53,459 --> 01:22:59,639
regarding the usage mysterious and the

1564
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,709
same thing quiz I quit too

1565
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:03,649
I know that there are some experimental

1566
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:08,340
draft about usage

1567
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:10,169
RFC about usage of packs in equity but I

1568
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:13,050
think that a lot of patients will be

1569
01:23:10,169 --> 01:23:16,949
raised and also there are questions

1570
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:19,289
about usage in IOT so when we have at

1571
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:21,719
least some limitations on hardware and

1572
01:23:19,289 --> 01:23:24,959
maybe additional limitations on around

1573
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:26,969
efficiency and about privacy at least

1574
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:30,389
about recommendations to prevent user

1575
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:33,359
numeration in some protocols for example

1576
01:23:30,389 --> 01:23:37,050
our space and in opec we have explicit

1577
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:41,429
recommendations about this and this is a

1578
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:43,649
question that also has to be verified so

1579
01:23:41,429 --> 01:23:48,019
in fact the main purpose of the slides

1580
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:50,909
was not only to give the overview but to

1581
01:23:48,019 --> 01:23:54,780
announce a call for viewers I think will

1582
01:23:50,909 --> 01:23:56,629
repeat this on the list and we really

1583
01:23:54,780 --> 01:24:00,030
need as a reviewers for such questions

1584
01:23:56,629 --> 01:24:02,389
because I believe that capture panel

1585
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:04,499
members will provide really good

1586
01:24:02,389 --> 01:24:06,959
security assessment the liquid

1587
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:10,260
verification of all security proofs but

1588
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:13,709
it will be really good if people who

1589
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:17,070
know each piece of TLS and speeches a

1590
01:24:13,709 --> 01:24:21,479
piece of ike we too could assess each

1591
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:24,329
pack regarding their convenience to use

1592
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:27,149
it for usage with these protocols so the

1593
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:29,989
soul please questions and please really

1594
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:29,989
need help here

1595
01:24:39,349 --> 01:24:45,360
hello maybe one formal remark or for the

1596
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:49,309
process of a finding independent

1597
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:53,809
reviewers many questions belong to

1598
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:57,210
interpret bility live TLS and IPSec

1599
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:59,099
based on my experience in ITU in that

1600
01:24:57,210 --> 01:25:02,369
case you used some kind of liaison

1601
01:24:59,099 --> 01:25:06,540
statements to request people from these

1602
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:11,009
groups I hope that the people from TLS

1603
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:15,659
and IP Shekhar here but it can be not

1604
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:22,010
the case on earth such as so much people

1605
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:24,329
so many of them here I propose to ask

1606
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:27,449
corresponding working groups important

1607
01:25:24,329 --> 01:25:31,340
group chairs the assistant find it can

1608
01:25:27,449 --> 01:25:39,150
dependent reviewers from where people

1609
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:43,020
working kill these groups efficient miss

1610
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:45,949
opening have people who experts in TLS

1611
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:48,599
in this room staring at some of them

1612
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:50,339
yeah

1613
01:25:48,599 --> 01:25:52,260
and we did announce in the in the TLS

1614
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:54,090
working group at least that this

1615
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:59,270
competition was going on and we needed

1616
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:59,270
reviewer reviewers relaying through Java

1617
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:04,230
jour

1618
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:07,348
Jorn I said could you post the place

1619
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:10,530
where to find the replies regarding VT b

1620
01:26:07,349 --> 01:26:20,510
PE ke i did not find out the mailing

1621
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:26,690
list could you post replies recording

1622
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:30,179
i'm knowing them try VT b PE k of course

1623
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:32,460
there was a replies for about VT VT key

1624
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:35,250
and it was collated and it wasn't a

1625
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:38,010
slice so yes for all protocols including

1626
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:41,849
is this VT b PK

1627
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:44,670
we have their responses and yes we've

1628
01:26:41,849 --> 01:26:46,330
collected them so no problem here are

1629
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:49,120
they published somewhere

1630
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:50,860
they were sent some of they were sent in

1631
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:55,240
the least time Jose would say directly

1632
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:58,150
to the chairs so I think that on stage 3

1633
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:59,889
or stage 4 we we just published all the

1634
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:01,960
stuff that I collected because some

1635
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:04,840
answers was not in the single message

1636
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:08,530
some were in the PDF so to try to

1637
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:11,830
organize this in some case in some sense

1638
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:16,630
and publish it for viewers in a

1639
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:20,940
convenient way we are collecting all the

1640
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:24,610
responses in one place but as responses

1641
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:27,910
even was obtained after the deadline if

1642
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:30,370
be honest some responses so we'll grate

1643
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:35,740
them into eight groups and have this

1644
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:38,650
ready for the reviews sorry Ivan is

1645
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:46,179
typing here waiting to see if anything

1646
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:48,070
comes up so nothing ok ok so and if you

1647
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:49,960
have any other considerations about the

1648
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:53,530
process and any other questions to be

1649
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:56,470
asked please at least the chairs because

1650
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:58,960
I think that all new questions can also

1651
01:27:56,470 --> 01:28:01,710
be considered by the review panel

1652
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:04,600
reviewers like Alexis said in the

1653
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:10,210
beginning in the chair slides so only

1654
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:12,760
questions are still welcome I think ok

1655
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:16,480
thank you and a reminder to the group

1656
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:19,900
that we are soliciting more participants

1657
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:23,349
for the quickly review panel we expect

1658
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:25,420
this review of picks for the reviewers

1659
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:27,850
to review multiple pegs rather than one

1660
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:31,060
so that we have a consistent comparable

1661
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:34,480
review we may gather them in respect to

1662
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:36,700
augmented all for augmented well we have

1663
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:39,339
four of each so it may be four per

1664
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:43,330
reviewer so this is quite a large

1665
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:45,210
requests and so we would hope that's we

1666
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:48,220
have some dedicated people that have

1667
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:51,130
have the energy and time to put into

1668
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:57,600
this so we'd appreciate a mailing see

1669
