1
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,570
nice picture this room

2
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,880
so we almost ready to start the

3
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:34,419
etiquette having some lost instruction

4
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:38,280
on how to round the laptop okay so this

5
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:44,919
is the mpls working group meeting in

6
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:47,729
Montreal we had do top schedules when we

7
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:52,210
started that we actually found out that

8
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:55,840
we could make it through hours so from

9
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,580
having lost the room to actually have an

10
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,619
awful discussion we actually went to

11
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:04,510
pretty squeezed agenda but during the

12
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,610
second session growth session for only

13
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,580
15 minutes even make sense

14
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:20,320
so one session the next session is

15
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:25,169
cancelled so we have a number of changes

16
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,900
since lost time first of all I want to

17
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,810
actually join me and welcoming your

18
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,090
troller back to the MPLS workgroup

19
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:42,900
designer the last time you were here of

20
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:49,239
slum and wasn't it yeah we have one

21
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:53,469
chair Nick he's back in Yemen a vacation

22
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:59,139
I know that that was allowed but landed

23
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:01,830
this we have a new share peroxide please

24
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,830
welcome Tara

25
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:16,600
and since very Flavius poster secretary

26
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:19,960
we also have a new secretary action with

27
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:24,700
that I think we're ready to start you

28
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:28,390
have the note well on the screen I say

29
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,219
as Chris said morning meeting I'm not

30
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,520
going to read through all this but it's

31
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,420
important that you do so please read the

32
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,310
note well and understand what it means

33
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,960
basically it says whatever you do here

34
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:49,840
it's a contribution diet gap okay and

35
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:51,789
next slide so the administrative things

36
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:58,030
around here we have all your streaming

37
00:06:51,790 --> 00:07:00,310
so when you talk to the meeting you

38
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,859
stand in front of the microphone them to

39
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,310
pretty close because they are set draw

40
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:09,550
the load if you are presenting that is

41
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:13,240
they in crossover are use the chip stand

42
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,260
on that or if he slips do it and when

43
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:22,800
you start speaking

44
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:25,320
state your name on that we have it I

45
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,970
don't think we have any meet that go

46
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:32,590
presentations so that should be but I

47
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:35,260
mean they do meet echoes the etherpad is

48
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:39,190
up and running so if you want to add

49
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:45,370
anything to it you can do that at the

50
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:50,260
meeting going on you find the online

51
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:53,740
again then slice at that URL next like

52
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,610
this so again the bashing this is that

53
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:02,650
draft we intend to this is a status

54
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:07,120
report and the that we attempt to

55
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:10,030
discuss I think that the preeminent slot

56
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,689
at the end is no doubt enteric will

57
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:17,729
discuss

58
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:25,339
the gang model graphs during the status

59
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:29,308
report any comment okay let's go on

60
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:33,120
there are blue sheets circulating fill

61
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:40,379
them in and they turn them not to be

62
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:45,769
shares but to Mack over here next like

63
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:50,069
this so we have killer artists that be

64
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:53,639
been fixing this time both of them are

65
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:59,430
fairly uncomplicated the first one was

66
00:08:53,639 --> 00:09:02,339
to use the zero instead of a o or if it

67
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,189
was the other way around I don't know

68
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:09,600
so this is verified its editorial

69
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:11,730
waiting for an update and visible I'm

70
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:18,779
the data tracker until that object

71
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:22,319
happens the next one this is sometimes

72
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,480
you actually make work for yourself so

73
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:28,920
what happened here was that then we are

74
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:32,699
Sierra to publish the draft they forgot

75
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,680
to put the paragraphing so we made in

76
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:37,800
the dark but to put the paragraph back

77
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:42,449
in and that's now they're also listed as

78
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:45,120
an editorial in author and also

79
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:51,029
available or visible in the data

80
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:53,790
correctly the Aesop's we have had two

81
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:59,579
outgoing in new incoming that's actually

82
00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:06,050
the opposite to what usually it is the

83
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:11,399
ones are that the two nations are fairly

84
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:14,519
easy one is say together with other

85
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,699
working group react to responded on any

86
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:22,410
relation from I think heat that it was

87
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:24,430
15 on a work done for of TNT

88
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,130
standardization work

89
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:31,050
and the other one was also question from

90
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:35,590
the stereo 15 on a clarification on

91
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:40,920
ambulance sharing protection fairly

92
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:43,390
straightforward next document status

93
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,360
there had been a couple of metres of

94
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,760
hidden talent in new grads this time you

95
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,090
suddenly have free drafts our sorry our

96
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,930
deceased where we haven't had any new

97
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:59,940
RHCs

98
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:59,939
this time we had three new RFC's so

99
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:08,260
thank you everyone that is involved in

100
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:11,710
authoring reviewing pushing on these

101
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:19,410
documents so that you got published we

102
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:24,130
have documents in the policy and askew

103
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:26,530
the first one was blocked because of a

104
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:31,560
Miss from the mr. F is gone

105
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:34,420
it's a wrong and big cluster that the

106
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:40,329
RCA doesn't work in previous now and

107
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:43,000
they say that somewhere before Singapore

108
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:47,770
all those drove all those documents we

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,960
do in to author 48 so when that happens

110
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:55,420
to be prepared and actually respond

111
00:11:49,960 --> 00:12:01,510
quickly there we have documents with the

112
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:04,240
is key they are progressing around the

113
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:09,340
well I don't think there is any draw the

114
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:13,030
real big gaps though we are waiting for

115
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:15,460
a revised ID for the biggest protection

116
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:21,600
framework I haven't seen that yet but it

117
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:25,840
should be progressing we have one you

118
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:31,500
there wouldn't do document and that's

119
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:36,190
the special purpose labels terminology

120
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,960
short draft should be very easy what the

121
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,270
author that was a

122
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,930
if you don't have any further comments

123
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,230
hungry

124
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:53,859
we request what group does called

125
00:12:44,230 --> 00:13:01,140
try it to me Singapore actually all of

126
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:04,360
the documents we have until working you

127
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:13,990
part of the data tracker it has been

128
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:18,550
updated the are doing something to our

129
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:23,500
doubts even though I kind of push hard

130
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:26,170
on some of the others and we have two

131
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,890
recently expired drafts both of them all

132
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:33,040
on the agenda and that part is Buganda

133
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:35,949
will be miss off iris about myself and

134
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,650
swap still working to explain what what

135
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:42,160
the issue is

136
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:47,890
next thing we have new individuals rafts

137
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:54,610
all of them or on on the agenda and that

138
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:57,699
we have updated individual graphs I have

139
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:01,000
a can't find any surprises here there is

140
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:05,320
one error though because I've been

141
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,720
working this afternoon drop Shang MP

142
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,640
lisanna or Ahmad multicart is no longer

143
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:17,650
in the video graph to see what you've

144
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:20,980
done I accepted it just after noon and

145
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:24,910
then we have an issue that was brought

146
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,450
in yeah I have waited a bit to see what

147
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:32,560
responses we got that there is a

148
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:37,690
mismatch between 30 to 36 but the 33rd

149
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:44,109
estate was widely implemented and 50 36

150
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:48,910
and some some implementations go through

151
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:51,329
as 50 36 and some at 30 36 and that's a

152
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:55,319
label for month and

153
00:14:51,329 --> 00:15:00,329
if certain if they cannot explicit where

154
00:14:55,319 --> 00:15:04,660
the unirrigated should be put in that

155
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:07,449
that feel so it's we have assumed that

156
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:13,029
it is say on the least significant bits

157
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:15,128
but we will actually start a poll to

158
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,930
some of the key implementers and ask

159
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:22,660
what we have done and see if we have

160
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:26,589
everyone doing the same thing and once

161
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:28,029
we actually understand the situation out

162
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:35,759
there we will actually write some text

163
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:35,759
around it around what what should happen

164
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:50,790
so if some of the reports on this is

165
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:54,490
actually reports from at least

166
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:58,300
ultimately from the the author's so if

167
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:04,870
we picked up a little bit here and there

168
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:07,540
if actually reminding working group

169
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:11,170
document author that directly supposed

170
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,060
to give us a short update you send you a

171
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,779
mail before every meeting that you need

172
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:23,529
to respond to that and tell you tell us

173
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:29,860
what the situation is on this page that

174
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:34,569
second draft it's also wrong it's

175
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:37,029
actually not waiting for the Shepherd

176
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:45,130
right after review it's actually I have

177
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:47,439
that I have a sensory request for

178
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,500
publication for this up today so should

179
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:53,290
probably be somewhere else in the list

180
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,990
and this actually affect the or more

181
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:59,110
extent LED or or more extension and it

182
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,610
should or perfect air drafts in spring

183
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:06,349
and

184
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:09,380
each subject they have or moderate salsa

185
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:18,679
so they should be possible to progress

186
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:21,250
huh okay ah go back the first one be at

187
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,230
the directly we try to set up a meeting

188
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:28,130
discussing this draft among all that

189
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,830
some people that have been contributing

190
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,800
to discussion on the list one of the key

191
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,470
people Carlos is not fear so we are

192
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:44,899
moving the discussion to the working

193
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:50,420
group mailing list okay next the MDP

194
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:53,930
made is a long-term draft still there

195
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:59,900
for a long time we actually just waiting

196
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:01,490
for the MIT doctor to find the word to

197
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,510
close the working group dark hole and

198
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:12,440
then go ahead and request publication

199
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:22,940
and we have close to encrypt loss called

200
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:26,300
for the summary fRRR z de and again on

201
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:29,060
the special-purpose latest terminology

202
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:33,379
draft we think is ready to for working

203
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:36,260
group last call but we will wait in a

204
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,540
couple of weeks for four comments so if

205
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,750
you have ideas and comments please send

206
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,750
them in

207
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:50,690
ingress protection framework has one

208
00:18:47,200 --> 00:19:01,730
disgusts left and I totally mean today

209
00:18:50,690 --> 00:19:09,010
he will help fix up the horas que 287

210
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:14,900
length clarification anticipated a and

211
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:23,420
the RI RSVP FRR we have comment that we

212
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:28,130
need to address sr over IP I think this

213
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:29,720
is the text here was correct so probably

214
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,710
when we wrote it but just now it's

215
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:39,429
actually in the are s 'edit askew so we

216
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,429
need Shanta so then you have yang models

217
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:47,750
so hello but we wanted to give a quick

218
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,650
update on the modeling that's happening

219
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:56,720
in MPLS for p group we have a couple of

220
00:19:50,650 --> 00:20:00,800
crafts to begin with LDP modeling ml d p

221
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,290
and l vp for unicast and multicast the

222
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,840
first one there is a working group last

223
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,270
call the requests coming in from offers

224
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,559
and we will initiate this working group

225
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:16,160
last call for the second one it has

226
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,610
undergone a yang doctor review cycle and

227
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,780
they received comments the authors

228
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:26,030
should be addressing the comments now

229
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:30,139
and get back circle back to us there are

230
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:34,970
two other drafts for modeling in yang as

231
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:37,220
well one for MPLS face both are in the

232
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:41,000
yang doctors review one we got some

233
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,580
feedback today and we will be here the

234
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,910
authors will be addressing via the

235
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,189
comments from the yang doctors and we

236
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:53,000
will proceed for asking Bertie group

237
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,330
last call once we have all the comments

238
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,419
address

239
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:03,908
yeah so on the ml DP gang actually you

240
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,059
would do the working group club sport

241
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:13,600
because I'm a dork or that traffic oh

242
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:14,168
sure definitely yeah beauties back to

243
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,689
you

244
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:19,179
Sleeping Beauty's I think this is the

245
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:21,820
third meeting we have this list I

246
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:24,330
actually put it on the mpls wiki you can

247
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:28,090
find it through that URL

248
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:31,918
those are drafts that was sent to the

249
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:37,209
working group but never progress and

250
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,009
it's fairly unclear or most of them if

251
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:45,009
people want to throw them at progress

252
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:47,470
I'm an art so I asked you to look at the

253
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:51,700
list see if you have anything there if

254
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:54,419
you have feeling the information that

255
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,850
tell us what your your glance or if it's

256
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:01,210
just you don't you won't progress it

257
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:04,559
it's fine but we won't have a you away

258
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,559
your dirty clothes in the town

259
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:19,230
oh good evening my name is sha da we're

260
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:24,280
going to talk about the EP ofx

261
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:26,470
presenting on behalf of my quarters so

262
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,290
we on the agenda we have background and

263
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,750
problem statement and this was presented

264
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:36,610
in bangkok and we have updates from

265
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:42,580
previous version in next steps so that's

266
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:44,949
the background so we have EPE CID the

267
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,199
peer nodes that peer sets it and add Sid

268
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,620
that are getting advertised from let's

269
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,920
say SBR one to the controller and then

270
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,260
this EPE Sid is getting used in building

271
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,910
SR enter and SR path across multiple

272
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:05,230
ASIS or it's getting used as a bottom

273
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:09,430
label for a for a SR path up to the SBR

274
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:11,710
- so what we want to do so in this

275
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:14,620
example let's say there's a switch

276
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:20,920
between a str1 and str2 and and the link

277
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:23,199
shown here is is broken so in this case

278
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,240
we would want to do an MPLS ping and

279
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,680
traceroute and be able to detect the

280
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,920
broken link and the way to do it is the

281
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,120
controller that sets up the LSP knows

282
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:39,130
what the EP meaning of the EP said is

283
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,429
whether it's a node set and what are the

284
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,130
associated links whether it's a year set

285
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:48,940
seed and what are the associated links

286
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:54,010
so the controller includes that

287
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:56,520
information and you know the headend can

288
00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:01,270
do MPLS ping and traceroute with those

289
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:04,690
facts and then the facts validation will

290
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:06,850
happen on ESB r1 so there are three

291
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,950
kinds of information that we need to

292
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:12,129
validate first thing is the control

293
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:16,380
information that bgp LS has advertised

294
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:19,290
any PE cid and it says certain

295
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:22,380
information and that information has to

296
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:24,990
get validated when the packet comes in

297
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,790
the OM packet comes in that information

298
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,650
has to match with what what has been

299
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,990
advertised the second thing is the

300
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,840
forwarding state has to match so spr 1

301
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:38,850
says it is sending traffic on let's say

302
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,399
1 link the top link between asbr 1 and 2

303
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,560
and then when the packet really arrives

304
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,170
on ESP r2 it needs to validate whether

305
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,770
the incoming interface is matching with

306
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:52,920
what ESP r1 said so the way this gets

307
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:55,379
advertised from ESD r1 is downstream

308
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,140
detailed mapping TLV this is from RFC 8

309
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,050
0 to 9 and there is no change from that

310
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:05,760
so what we are doing here is we are just

311
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:08,190
defining the facts for the epe suits for

312
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:13,440
peer nodes it sets it and adjacency said

313
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:16,080
a so updates from last revision so we

314
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,300
the last revision had peer note said

315
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,270
with a single set of local and remote

316
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:24,210
interfaces so we changed the definition

317
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,460
and to include multiple sets of local

318
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,140
and remote interfaces that's because the

319
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,170
peer node state could have been

320
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,260
advertised for a multi hop ebgp

321
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,690
session and there may be multiple

322
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,220
underlying links so both the links

323
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,030
though all the multiple links have to be

324
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,150
included as part of the factor

325
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:47,820
definition so the definition has been

326
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,930
updated for this and there was a comment

327
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:53,820
from last presentation to optimize the

328
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,280
peer set seed that has been incorporated

329
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,830
and the security consideration section

330
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:04,110
has been updated so that's the

331
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:07,770
definition for the peer nodes it so we

332
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:10,080
have the local a s number remote es

333
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,690
number local BGP route ready and remote

334
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:18,000
BGP route riding we also have the number

335
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:21,030
of interface pairs pairs of local and

336
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,210
multiple set multiple pairs of local and

337
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,070
remote interface addresses and there is

338
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,960
an address family bit to indicate

339
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,960
whether it be 4 or v6

340
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:40,918
so Pierre said said so that is local and

341
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,738
yes number in router ID and there are

342
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:48,149
multiple sets of this remote node

343
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:50,759
information and along with there are so

344
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:53,340
from based on because the Pierre sets it

345
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:56,489
can correspond to multiple node sets

346
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,559
peer node set so the changes that were

347
00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:00,330
done for peer nodes that have also been

348
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,609
incorporated in the set side where there

349
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:08,759
are multiple number of interface pairs

350
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:11,849
along with the address one so that was

351
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:14,460
there is another draft with with which

352
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:16,168
is very similar similar approach there

353
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,099
are some minor differences in the

354
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:24,450
definition and so we are talking to the

355
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:25,739
authors so beyond saying hi we have the

356
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,379
same draft we haven't made much progress

357
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:31,019
so we thought whatever update we have we

358
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:33,539
could present it this time and it

359
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:39,239
probably will talk to them tomorrow and

360
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:41,460
then see how we can progress and one

361
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:44,220
more thing before I take questions I

362
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,399
wasn't too sure this is supposed to go

363
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,179
in MPLS or spring I think I forgot what

364
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:50,178
the decision was

365
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,670
Sonique news in the media tonight

366
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:19,370
you know you're correct

367
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:21,050
one of the con orange spring cochair so

368
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,979
yes indeed there is another draft which

369
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,629
is similar

370
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,060
last time it was present in the in the

371
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,990
spring there was kind of an agreement to

372
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:33,070
tomorrow so it probably needs to be

373
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:36,740
sorted out before bringing spring or

374
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:39,409
MPLS to improve it in him

375
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,990
well the definition of the effect would

376
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,840
be good to be discussing spring because

377
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,300
this is where art is a designer and

378
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,720
discuss now if you choose a good point

379
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,050
in MPs opera and fine with two

380
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,930
means of drafting and please this is

381
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:59,389
again the same situation we have the

382
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,190
local draft we need to produce in

383
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,900
somewhere that you make sure I need to

384
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,810
make sure that the other working group

385
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:11,720
actually are aware of and part of the

386
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:13,429
discussion but you feel to the sort of

387
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,310
to be nebulous one because there is a

388
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,870
good point so it's okay for me but so

389
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,210
definitions effect really needs to be

390
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,939
discussed in spring because it could

391
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:33,500
really be rigidity so every update I

392
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:35,290
post about the so here's how I see one

393
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,810
working group is progressing we make

394
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:42,920
reports to be three meeting in that

395
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:47,210
personal but discussions on technical

396
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:49,940
issues goes to the quality yes going

397
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:55,550
said image necessary you make

398
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:59,150
presentations in both but my point my

399
00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,440
point is to to reminder that for

400
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,710
everything which is about definition of

401
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,740
the fact we need to discuss the change

402
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:09,560
in in spring because it's easy to say

403
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,940
today but maybe in one year from air we

404
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:17,200
will have older for that

405
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,200
that's except to Suzy witches

406
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:27,940
Sam Waldron from Google which go to the

407
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:31,820
picture I have one question so here

408
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,820
let's take if the path between switch

409
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,790
and the SBR too is broken the packet is

410
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,070
processed on the switch correct

411
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,720
how does it get back to the source so

412
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:45,080
the switch is not visible right it's a

413
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,990
layer 3 connection between from ASPR one

414
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,449
to SBR 2 and we have advertiser SID

415
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:53,000
which which says it's sending traffic on

416
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,480
those two links so let's say that one is

417
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,110
broken

418
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,790
so on a SBR one when the packet comes in

419
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,699
it it looks at the forwarding plane it

420
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:03,740
has two links so in the downstream

421
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,350
mapping it says I have two links and

422
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,340
then the ecmp tracing happens for in

423
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,059
case of tree stump

424
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:14,620
no i'm talking about the via corresponds

425
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:19,070
ok how does it get back to the source

426
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:20,750
yeah so I think we have another so my

427
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,899
question is yeah say you are knitting

428
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:27,820
the the next draft to be part of the

429
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:30,320
solution so this draft is basically

430
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,379
talks only about the fact effin ition

431
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,570
but if you see end-to-end solution you

432
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,000
would need some way of sending the

433
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,590
packet back so I think that we have a

434
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:47,210
next presentation that talks about how

435
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:49,250
that can be done okay hi this is the for

436
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:52,870
Francisco can you go back to that effect

437
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,950
definition so I have two comments

438
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:59,750
comment number one is that when you have

439
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:02,660
pair set you cannot this is where your

440
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:06,679
node you know I the next one you can go

441
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:12,290
to next so in the peer said you cannot

442
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:14,270
identify the interface on which the fact

443
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,178
needs to go so we are listing all of

444
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:19,580
them and in the peer node as well

445
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:21,530
there's a lot of information from a user

446
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,928
interface and and this is the problem

447
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:26,840
with with the fact because the fact

448
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:28,669
definitely has started from MPLS when we

449
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,559
have like LTP and rsvp-te

450
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:34,220
now we signal routing

451
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,639
every time the defining an incident we

452
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,529
are finding need for new FAC which is a

453
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:41,090
problem because if you look at it even

454
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:45,519
the information needed here

455
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:49,340
how much parameter user gonna input is

456
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,919
way too much so I am concerned about the

457
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,740
complexity there is involve in a

458
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,350
solution and we need to step back from

459
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,980
chasing defining effect for every sip

460
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:03,080
type to define effect that can cover all

461
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,769
sake type segmenting is all about

462
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,250
simplification so this is my major

463
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:11,899
comment I have a follow-up presentation

464
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,859
to that effect but that's my major

465
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:18,230
comment

466
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:21,078
yeah so it's not necessary that the user

467
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,899
has to input the local interface and

468
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,819
remote interface in all of this because

469
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,918
this has to get advertised by a BGP

470
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:29,750
unless from the router to the controller

471
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,690
and then there is one entity which

472
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:35,530
understands what does it means and that

473
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:41,359
entity can somehow get that information

474
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:43,790
you know in a encoded in effect so yeah

475
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,009
it's all about you know how you get

476
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:49,869
there a solution to work but I think the

477
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,869
problem is that you rely on controls I

478
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:58,099
kind of lost the the picture here

479
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,290
because I think I mean it in text and

480
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,030
use the pattern right your question in

481
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,750
an email send it to the list

482
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:08,690
yeah you okay fine thank you yeah but I

483
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,599
just one comment you relying on control

484
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:19,760
pain to verify control free so that is

485
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:23,060
the problem Greg necessity I'm looking

486
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:28,250
at this capture and doesn't look at

487
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:32,569
there is a typo that you probably will

488
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:38,660
have either four octaves or for ipv6 you

489
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:41,420
will have sixteen not six okay sixteen

490
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:44,029
yeah yeah okay then okay I just double

491
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,940
check reading it right yeah

492
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:49,340
it's wrong in the draft what I would

493
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,620
suggest you is that it's probably likely

494
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,520
that local and remote address will be

495
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:59,240
the same family so somehow highlighted

496
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,150
that it's must be one family it cannot

497
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,240
be were called us before and remote with

498
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:08,090
six yeah sure okay yeah so make it more

499
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,209
strict and if we can go to the other

500
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:14,740
side I think that in answering Sam's

501
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:18,860
question you said that there is some

502
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:21,859
trace route takes place is it trace

503
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,710
route from SBR or trace route from the

504
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,410
head end it's trace route from the head

505
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:31,520
end when there is an SRT is our path

506
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:33,560
constructed using those EPS it's okay in

507
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,210
my experience trace route and the CMP is

508
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:41,630
a black magic so will be very useful if

509
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:45,020
you can describe how you guarantee that

510
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:48,770
you explore all available paths because

511
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:51,370
I understand that's one of their key

512
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,370
technologies

513
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:21,500
okay hi good evening everyone I'm Mukul

514
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:24,290
from juniper networks and I will be

515
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:29,000
presenting in terrorists om for Assad

516
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:31,400
networks on behalf of others so the

517
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,170
agenda of my presentation will be first

518
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,099
I will talk about the problem statement

519
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:38,990
and a few RFC's previous work which we

520
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:41,270
have found which is related to this

521
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,328
problem and we will discuss what is the

522
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,009
issues with it you know with that and

523
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:49,910
our proposal how we are trying to solve

524
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:58,310
it and we have a working example to

525
00:37:49,910 --> 00:38:00,980
explain our proposal so Intel som

526
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:03,849
problem is a well known problem we have

527
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:08,119
I think it has been worked in the past

528
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:10,550
but here we are trying to this problem I

529
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:16,760
am trying to state is is applicable more

530
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:20,750
for the Assad Network so we have 2a s s

531
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:24,109
s 1 and s 2 and we have a and both the

532
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:26,839
sides we have s our path setup there is

533
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:29,509
a controller which gets the BGP LS feed

534
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:33,049
from is we are from both the s and

535
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:36,290
that's how he knows the topology of both

536
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:40,880
days and and and it can push that

537
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:44,800
information to the ingress r1 and also

538
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,050
set up LSP across yes so in this example

539
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,680
let's say we have I mean with the help

540
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:55,720
of controller there is a LSP setup from

541
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,660
R 1 R 2 SB r 1 s p r3 r3 and r4

542
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:04,310
now when you now this a LSP is a cross s

543
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:08,480
and if you try to do a om mechanism the

544
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:11,180
crosses then the router on the s2 might

545
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,170
not have the will not have the return

546
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:20,169
path and hence the problem is the ping

547
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:20,170
and traceroute will not work across yes

548
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,080
so these are the two previous work which

549
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,000
we have found there might be some drafts

550
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:33,000
but at least these two RFC is the first

551
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,990
one it talks about pings and traced out

552
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,720
from a PSM and this is not related to

553
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:45,180
interests but the problem with this

554
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,580
draft is it is it tries to set up a

555
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,640
return path from each node using GRE

556
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:53,420
tunnels which is which is not very

557
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:58,560
scalable and it is operationally

558
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:02,660
extensive the second draft 77043 it

559
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:07,200
talks about for the MPLS LS fees

560
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:10,680
interest M and it there they have

561
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,910
defined a new TLV eco relay node relay

562
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,850
address stack TL v which essentially

563
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:21,060
puts the IP address of the router which

564
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:24,600
does the relay but the problem with this

565
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:28,020
is the packet for each hop has to go up

566
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:30,180
to the control plane so basically each

567
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:35,420
hop we are taking the packet up to the

568
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:37,830
control plane which is again not good so

569
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:42,450
the proposal which we are trying to do

570
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:45,740
is for the SR Network we define a

571
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:50,700
reverse path using a stack of cid labels

572
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:54,740
so so we define a new stack TLV reverse

573
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:57,540
path label stack TL v which is a set of

574
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,870
label stack of labels which the ingress

575
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:04,350
router can put when the eco request is

576
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:07,410
generated and how it knows is it could

577
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:10,140
be yr the controller or it is pre known

578
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:12,799
by at the head end but that is not part

579
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:16,730
of this RFC but it is possible that the

580
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,590
head end knows about the return path and

581
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,750
that it can be put into reverse path

582
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:25,430
label stack TL v and the eco request

583
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:28,110
reaches up to the end point this were

584
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:31,410
reverse path stack TL we will

585
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,360
essentially contain a list of SIDS which

586
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,828
could be perfect said decency state

587
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,769
binding sites

588
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:43,259
and essentially when the router at the

589
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:46,198
second is when he receives the echo

590
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:49,619
request while responding back all it has

591
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:52,289
to do is copy those labels from the a

592
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:56,039
request to construct the echo reply so

593
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:58,199
is so this solves a problem that the

594
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,630
packet does not go to control plane at

595
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:05,609
each and every hop so it's all data

596
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:08,910
plane forwarding across says this is the

597
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:12,058
packet format for the reverse path label

598
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:14,910
stack TLB essentially the key thing over

599
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:17,009
here is the number of labels which tells

600
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:20,598
you the or it is order set of labels in

601
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:24,869
the reverse path starting from the

602
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:33,359
receiving router and then it is a set of

603
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:37,349
labels so this is a working example we

604
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,859
do have a small prototype for this thing

605
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:43,319
but if you take the same LSP which we

606
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:46,019
had in the first slide let's say we have

607
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:50,038
set up LSP is starting from r1 and

608
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:54,419
ending at R for the echo request we'll

609
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:56,219
go with this set of sets which have the

610
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:01,319
terminologies these are the notes it for

611
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:06,329
our to sbr one is we are three and node

612
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:09,299
set of p4 are for change and for this

613
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:11,459
echo request the reverse path will will

614
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:14,759
be the set of labels starting from our

615
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:16,410
four back to r1 so in this example the

616
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:18,900
reverse path year we will contain this

617
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:21,420
set of labels notes it for s are for

618
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:26,880
let's say if it if it has to come where

619
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:31,019
the sbr for then EP set for SBR for is

620
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:35,459
we are between ASPR 4 and 1 and then

621
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:37,589
notes it for r1 so so r1 will just

622
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:39,868
essentially take these labels and put

623
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:47,130
that while responding back to the echo

624
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:48,330
request so that's all I think this is my

625
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,880
last life

626
00:43:48,330 --> 00:44:08,340
sister adopt it as a MPLS working

627
00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:11,550
document I think there was a male but

628
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:15,240
wheelchair okay yeah again Greg murski

629
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:18,260
City I would have to say that this is

630
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,259
not no idea

631
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:27,600
so ro mentioned their Stowe discussion

632
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:30,330
of BD directed and BFD directed used to

633
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,610
have portion of this proposal but now

634
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:37,380
it's a part of individual draft in

635
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:41,010
spring working group on draft near Skid

636
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:44,700
Spring BFD which proposes to use

637
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:48,000
explicit list of SIDS for controlling

638
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:52,040
the return for PFD so what you're

639
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,310
proposing is already being proposed okay

640
00:44:52,040 --> 00:45:04,050
so I appreciate your looking into this

641
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:06,810
draft and welcome your comments my name

642
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:15,060
is Shonda so your proposal you also use

643
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:17,490
an pls thing in NPOs is OSB thing is

644
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,790
used to bootstrap D of this session but

645
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:23,790
part of the proposal is that it can

646
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:27,029
communicate the list of SIDS to be used

647
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:29,550
to direct PFD but at the same time it

648
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:34,110
mentions that the same can be used to

649
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:36,750
direct response for are there spring out

650
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:48,510
ping is itself so it's already there

651
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:51,180
okay so we look into that yeah Sam

652
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:54,000
Waldron from Google I won't actually go

653
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:57,870
back to the working scenario I'm I'm

654
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:02,720
okay but when things fail right let's

655
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:05,470
take in the topology diagram if the

656
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,689
the ping request fails for whatever

657
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:10,819
whatever reason between ASB r1 and ASB

658
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,880
are two or three Oh in that case is

659
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:16,849
about three right right so how what

660
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,890
exactly the return path label stack is

661
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:22,369
going to use because you're populating

662
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:24,410
with in this case whatever that cyd

663
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:26,329
you're saying that this is what you're

664
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:28,910
going to use right but it means nothing

665
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:30,619
on that intermediate no but that all

666
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,750
you're talking about the pink so pink if

667
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:35,210
so that use case will be for the

668
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,660
traceroute not for the ping the ping

669
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,900
fails that once it is there is some

670
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:43,339
breakage in that link we do not do a

671
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:47,210
ping does not try to find out where the

672
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:51,049
problem is that is traced off and the

673
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:53,839
ping packet when it when the LSP is

674
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:56,779
broken right it is going to be handled

675
00:46:53,839 --> 00:47:11,480
on that the device where it gets popped

676
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:13,670
is it right because it is generating the

677
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,859
ping I don't it is broken

678
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:18,859
it is not expecting any response from

679
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:20,480
the node at the intermediate node from

680
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:28,400
where it might be broken

681
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:30,440
okay I think there is a fundamental yeah

682
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,140
I just want to comment on Greg a comment

683
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,299
is it's two different things is here the

684
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,879
return leave a stack is used for onm

685
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:39,829
purpose it has no problem but using for

686
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,759
B a B is a problem because you have SPF

687
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:46,490
D so I it's a completely different thing

688
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:53,799
I think if confusing recommend a very

689
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:53,799
confusing it thank you thank you

00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,880
direct from juniper I had your drop and

811
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,090

reading cooked mature if you saw them

813
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:20,580
but basically to general comments there

814
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,470
is a year another way that the working

815
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,720
group is working on is called synonymous

816
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:28,470
flow labels that can achieve this

817
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,680
working yeah I'm not sure if it they can

818
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:35,100
a look at it or this approach you think

819
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,690
is better than or gives an advantage the

820
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,330
other of this approach will introduce

821
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:41,220
two labels in your stack if flow

822
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:43,770
identifier labeled is special illegal

823
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,779
yeah and then the flow ID and that one

824
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:48,120
doesn't mean those so I encourage you to

825
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,670
take a look at that and see if it fits

826
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,230
your need or not second comment if you

827
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:56,370
go back a couple of slides to where you

828
00:55:52,230 --> 00:56:00,060
have the encoding of the floor ID in

829
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:04,009
this time yeah yeah yeah so basically

830
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:07,080
your read of redefining the label and

831
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:09,650
the encoding of label and what bits to

832
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:13,200
mean different things you're setting

833
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:17,250
certain bits to be for measurement of

834
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:20,009
loss and delay in other things this is

835
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:22,890
not usual that you encode certain bits

836
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:29,880
in the label to mean certain things name

837
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:32,549
pls haven't seen that so

838
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:35,180
well it is part of the legal stack right

839
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:39,600
yeah

840
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:41,759
hi yuge what I'm saying is that it's not

841
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:46,819
the label but this part of the labels

842
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:49,280
directly we have some discopath result

843
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:53,280
[Music]

844
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,530
we are late so very quick coming don't

845
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,160
want to steal time from yourself you

846
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:59,040
myself

847
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,649
yeah it's very good comment Rocky's from

848
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,800
Cisco have you looked at the IOM data

849
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:07,350
fields because there could be one option

850
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:14,790
of using IOM data field that allows you

851
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:18,870
to do some of these things already sorry

852
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,410
because these graph I'm not that often

853
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:32,069
in the draft

854
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:34,890
maybe yeah also a kind situation not to

855
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:36,900
say take it offline meet after the

856
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:39,240
meeting and actually discuss it and see

857
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,530
if you can reach a common view and

858
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,529
report to the list

859
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:09,109
good afternoon everyone my name is lacus

860
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:14,539
Gandhi and I'm presenting the draft on

861
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:18,470
Iowa m4 SR SR mpls on behalf of all the

862
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:20,539
authors and contributors so the agenda

863
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:25,459
is look at the requirements and scope

864
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:28,039
the procedures and the next steps so

865
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,859
requirements is to transport the IOM

866
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:33,259
data fields reaches our MPLS and cap

867
00:58:30,859 --> 00:58:36,259
so basically carrying the way i'm

868
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:39,470
information like time stamps by the data

869
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:42,619
traffic to the scope is using the data

870
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:47,959
fields already defined by i ppm working

871
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:50,240
group and n2n I am we can look at the

872
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:54,490
hop-by-hop as well in future if there is

873
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,868
interest so the end cap looks like

874
00:58:54,490 --> 00:59:01,038
basically there is an IOM indicator

875
00:58:56,869 --> 00:59:06,769
label and and the IOM data feels that's

876
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:08,869
defined in the draft for my ppm so the

877
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:13,098
end cap node will insert the indicator

878
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:17,210
label and data field and the d cap node

879
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:19,880
will take a copy of the data packet and

880
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:21,920
forward the data packet so the copy will

881
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:27,829
be processed for there for the way I am

882
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:29,569
and it will also remove the end cap so

883
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:33,410
there are few methods that can be used

884
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:35,808
for indicator label allocation and we

885
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:39,078
can use some feedback from the working

886
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:42,680
group so one approach could be that we

887
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:46,809
use an extended special purpose label so

888
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:49,430
we are located label maybe say 1819

889
00:59:46,809 --> 00:59:51,289
there can be a network programming label

890
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:53,328
that's allocated by a controller for

891
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:55,369
this and controller would go and

892
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:58,640
provision all the end cap and d-cap

893
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:01,789
notes or there is signaling where the

894
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:04,390
cap node would signal it to them to the

895
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:04,390
end cap node

896
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:10,170
now there is some implication on passing

897
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:18,070
here does it night does it make mean

898
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:24,910
that you can't have a network without

899
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:27,100
the centralized controller either a

900
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:33,310
controller provision seat or is done by

901
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:35,500
a CLI for example yeah so there is some

902
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:41,140
implication on housing because we are

903
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:44,040
changing the MPLS header and that there

904
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:47,140
are some transit nodes that may use the

905
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:50,290
MPLS header all the labels for guessing

906
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,060
so now it may include IOM label there

907
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:54,250
are some notes that may look for the

908
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:56,560
well-known protocol type or IP hashing

909
01:00:54,250 --> 01:01:00,430
so now there is some implication there

910
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:02,470
as well so there is definitely some more

911
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:16,750
work and discuss and required on the

912
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:20,109
hashing part for this draft so next so

913
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:22,660
next steps as mentioned there is some

914
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:27,280
work required for a cmp hashing we can

915
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:29,859
definitely get good feedback from the

916
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,550
working group some feedback on the

917
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:35,860
hop-by-hop i ôm as well we welcome your

918
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:37,540
comments and suggestions and we are

919
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:39,390
seeking working of adoption for

920
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:48,750
destructor

921
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:51,790
thanks if you go 3 slide back one more

922
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:55,980
so and the second approach is it global

923
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,980
label in the whole network yeah yeah

924
01:01:56,070 --> 01:02:01,960
ingress and egress that's significant

925
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:06,310
yeah it will be easier to just have one

926
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:09,400
label let's say label you know 500 or so

927
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:11,470
that means this this this purpose and

928
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:16,620
everybody understands what 500 means in

929
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:16,620
the network then it becomes a special

930
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:26,559
miss kitty there might be a problem that

931
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:31,569
characteristic to MPLS and the Saran POS

932
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,339
is that you don't know where this came

933
01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:35,799
from

934
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:38,828
so how you differentiate the source how

935
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:42,519
you attribute if you especially if you

936
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:46,089
use the same label advertised by the

937
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:49,149
egress for all the possible encapsulate

938
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:50,650
errs how do you know where the source of

939
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:55,569
this and where the statistics that

940
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:59,400
repeater Soha it knows today right with

941
01:02:55,569 --> 01:02:59,400
the second let's take it to the list

942
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:07,619
Thanks

943
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:24,099
okay I'm presenting on behalf of my

944
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:30,240
colleague and I'm one of the coffers of

945
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:33,309
this draft so path segments Sid has been

946
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:39,520
adopted recently as a working group

947
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:42,549
document and this draft raises and will

948
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:46,650
start discussion and proposed solution

949
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:49,509
for using the path segments as

950
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:55,630
interworking between a certain POS and M

951
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:58,780
POS domains so the path segment is

952
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:00,280
defined in this segment draft which is a

953
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:04,720
working group draft for the spring

954
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:13,869
working group and it identifies the path

955
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:19,000
and allocated by their egress not only

956
01:04:13,869 --> 01:04:22,869
identify this for the purpose of OM and

957
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,020
performance monitoring but also it may

958
01:04:22,869 --> 01:04:29,859
be used for correlating for inter domain

959
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:35,920
and in bi-directional in the domain path

960
01:04:29,859 --> 01:04:40,299
correlation so in one of the possible

961
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:44,140
scenarios that we have multiple domains

962
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:49,450
from their access to the core network

963
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:53,020
and need to do and to end om and with

964
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:54,848
their incremental deployment for example

965
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:58,538
of Sorrento LS we might have a

966
01:04:54,849 --> 01:05:04,119
combination of a Sorrento s domains and

967
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:08,109
IP MPLS domains and then we considering

968
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:12,220
their scenarios how this can be

969
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:18,779
organized whether we're considering two

970
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:18,779
models one is a stitching and then its

971
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:28,980
encapsulation so basically they're

972
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:32,369
tunnel for the domain in case of

973
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:32,369
stitching then

974
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:43,680
we have for each domain path SID which

975
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:48,510
we refer as an iPad and then they can be

976
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:51,210
by the border node correlated from one

977
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:55,500
domain to another domain and then thus

978
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:59,910
providing end and correlation for the

979
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:03,869
nesting or tunneling model there exist

980
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:08,930
and end path and then each node might

981
01:06:03,869 --> 01:06:12,660
have and what's called as an S path and

982
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:17,299
for their nesting domain or the main

983
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:20,970
which tunnels from s are MPLS it's

984
01:06:17,299 --> 01:06:23,519
absolutely a path so the end-to-end path

985
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:27,379
identifier is transparent so it's only

986
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:32,640
ingress and egress are dealing with it

987
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:37,410
so this is a start of this work the

988
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:40,470
reward of be worked on and there will be

989
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:45,710
new updates we appreciate comments and

990
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:53,038
your interest and working together I

991
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:55,500
hope I save some time already in the

992
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:58,970
spring draft right it talks about path

993
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:03,599
segments for stitching the multiple

994
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:08,808
domains and stuff King can you send the

995
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:12,240
reference to this draft because well

996
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:15,150
again in my understanding of this draft

997
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:22,109
it does not go into the detail specifics

998
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:28,170
it goes that it's possible so let's take

999
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:30,420
it of one who are we one question by

1000
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:34,710
using path segment for stitching instead

1001
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:36,930
of using binding signal okay this is

1002
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:39,109
good question I'll I'll have to think

1003
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:43,609
about it but thank you

1004
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:45,380
for question yeah I think the brackets

1005
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:47,509
against a path segment is the the

1006
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:49,369
traffic that's coming in and binding CD

1007
01:07:47,509 --> 01:07:51,410
is the traffic that's gonna leave so you

1008
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:56,720
need to stitch the bindings path

1009
01:07:51,410 --> 01:08:00,230
segmented binding City but both of them

1010
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:04,118
are used to torque from juniper so the

1011
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:07,190
path segment is go to stitch

1012
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:09,380
well the path segment basically there

1013
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:11,660
needs to be a correlation from one five

1014
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:13,430
seven again it's in the stitching model

1015
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:16,399
there need to be correlation between

1016
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:18,080
path segment in one segment to the pass

1017
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:25,759
segment in the neighbor down stream

1018
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:29,170
segment by the boundary nodes yes only

1019
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,170
by the boundary nodes

1020
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:56,669
so low Anderson I'm going to talk about

1021
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:59,098
a set of registers actually a subset of

1022
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:02,239
the register under the heading LS

1023
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:06,690
beeping traceroute register in the Ayana

1024
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:11,778
and it's basically all the TLD and

1025
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:17,939
subtly reduces plus the message type and

1026
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:19,739
return codes and one more I have had as

1027
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:21,658
long as I've been averaging being shared

1028
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:24,558
I have had a problem here by

1029
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:26,879
understanding the rationale between

1030
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:31,019
behind how it was done

1031
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:37,529
so let me try to explain so they have a

1032
01:09:31,019 --> 01:09:43,019
background it started out at 43 79 a43

1033
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:47,130
17 I defined the structure 1829 updated

1034
01:09:43,019 --> 01:09:52,259
43 79 and changed some of the registers

1035
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:58,440
but not all and all the changes that was

1036
01:09:52,259 --> 01:10:00,389
in 80 29 did not get into the actually I

1037
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:03,419
Anna radius I said there is a disc

1038
01:10:00,389 --> 01:10:06,769
appearances between what the current RFC

1039
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:15,719
says and what actually in the radiuses

1040
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:25,110
80 time to wake up I'm some other

1041
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:30,449
continent somewhere the the 8126 it's

1042
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:32,820
more or less contemporary with the 80 29

1043
01:10:30,449 --> 01:10:35,369
but it's rather different there are

1044
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:39,349
subtle difference that actually affect

1045
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:44,848
the registers and when we did the last

1046
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:48,809
working group RC 81-66 we actually took

1047
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:52,230
what is in 80 29 and actually put that

1048
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:57,210
into the register to get the model to

1049
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:58,949
work from there are two groups of radius

1050
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:00,040
they are taking the simpler one to

1051
01:10:58,949 --> 01:11:05,950
actually show much

1052
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:08,410
my points 43 79

1053
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:12,910
it's a very technical solid document and

1054
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:20,260
it says for the Ayana registers that it

1055
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:24,340
needs to values from the specific

1056
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:27,360
pacification required procedure needs to

1057
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:31,300
be done by an experimental error see

1058
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:33,849
this is kind of an oxymoron it's not

1059
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:39,370
wrong but it's kind of complicating

1060
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:48,400
things more than necessary so this is

1061
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:51,640
what it looks like ah okay so updating

1062
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:58,629
things - uploading things to the ITF

1063
01:11:51,640 --> 01:12:03,370
actually got rid of mine my my building

1064
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:06,910
so if you look at a registry for example

1065
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:09,400
message type there is one part the

1066
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:11,620
standard action no problem at all it

1067
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,559
works just fine there is another one

1068
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:18,599
that says specification required and

1069
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:24,070
says that it's only experimental RSC's

1070
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:26,980
so a specification required is almost

1071
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:29,309
any document with you with any stretch

1072
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:35,070
of your mind can call a specification

1073
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:39,100
and it actually brings in the

1074
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:42,190
requirement for designated experts to

1075
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:45,580
support Ayana to allocate them if we

1076
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:47,530
look at the experimental or a C's but

1077
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:51,610
there are only four types of documents

1078
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:55,719
it sirtf IAB iesg

1079
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:58,179
an independent no other document so why

1080
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:00,250
use something that says we can take

1081
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:03,450
documents an entire world to actually

1082
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:12,070
describe what we're doing for type of

1083
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:14,050
ITF documents so 80 29 changes the

1084
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:22,929
experimental RSC

1085
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:26,530
in 44 43 79 to RC but basically this

1086
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:32,200
didn't ever get into the IANA registry

1087
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:36,820
but basically it it has the same problem

1088
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:42,940
we have a lot of any we can do any IT

1089
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:44,620
FRC but it's the same problem it's much

1090
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:48,190
fewer documents but no one actually

1091
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:55,090
indicated in the specification required

1092
01:13:48,190 --> 01:14:00,009
sorry about the animations so we have

1093
01:13:55,090 --> 01:14:03,670
one more thing here saying specification

1094
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:08,590
requirement RC needed in note is

1095
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:13,530
actually saying the same thing as using

1096
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:18,270
the registration policy the RC required

1097
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:22,690
Stuart give it to Korea to he came late

1098
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:27,160
so we can without any problem changes to

1099
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:36,330
a RAC required saying the same thing as

1100
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:39,130
a t29 says here are the list of possible

1101
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:41,140
registration procedures and I actually

1102
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:44,970
come to the conclusion we should use

1103
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:50,290
them we should not try to invent our own

1104
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:54,190
so I proposed going from specification

1105
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:56,380
required to RC required an alternative

1106
01:14:54,190 --> 01:15:00,370
would be to get high def review that was

1107
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:01,690
actually exclude the quite number of

1108
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:08,710
documents but I don't think it's

1109
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:13,230
necessary so the update we have made is

1110
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:16,980
actually aligned the concept with 8126

1111
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:20,709
we added code point for experimental use

1112
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:24,669
actually I've heard from people that

1113
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:26,980
actually were part of co-authoring a43

1114
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:33,590
79 but when

1115
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:38,030
use the experimental orosi needed you

1116
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:40,820
allocate a experimental code point but

1117
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:42,590
that's not true you act you it's a

1118
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:45,230
general code point that anyone can use

1119
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:50,450
it's just it's specified by an

1120
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:54,740
experimental RSC and then we are listing

1121
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:57,980
all the registration procedures even if

1122
01:15:54,740 --> 01:16:01,840
they don't result in any allocations

1123
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:04,759
even if they prohibit allocations so

1124
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:09,530
this is what the register would look

1125
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:11,810
like with what I've been talking about

1126
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:14,360
so we have the standard standards

1127
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:16,850
actions we have the RFC required

1128
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:20,179
we have experimental use and we have

1129
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:22,490
private use the last one is properly

1130
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:26,210
then the private use I don't feel team

1131
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:27,469
member hood yeah I think that's all no

1132
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:29,990
okay yeah

1133
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:32,360
we request for a working group to review

1134
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:34,940
this and actually comment on it I think

1135
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:42,080
you should just last call it now I'm

1136
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:43,759
kidding I you can't you can't do it

1137
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,410
working group adoption Paul if you want

1138
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,450
but you can't do a last call

1139
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:55,160
fortunately I didn't say my name so it's

1140
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:57,440
okay so QED compiler I was probably on

1141
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,990
something when I put experimental RC

1142
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:03,559
required you're completely right there

1143
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:04,760
should be RFC specify so I mean in so

1144
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,920
specification required

1145
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,420
it should be an RFC which is what I

1146
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,780
wanted I don't know why's that

1147
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:13,760
experimental so I received a part is I

1148
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:16,639
think the right thing and then the

1149
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,130
others are other is right I mean they

1150
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,650
haven't changed I think for the private

1151
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:23,090
use usually back in the day the when I

1152
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:25,820
was actually thinking about these things

1153
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:30,320
I would say that you need a vendor code

1154
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:32,450
pint before you actually but but yeah

1155
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:35,630
yeah but here I don't know if there's

1156
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:38,420
space for that but no go to the way you

1157
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:39,869
have the final listing of the I think

1158
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,929
yeah yeah

1159
01:17:39,869 --> 01:17:48,809
for this one so I think this is what you

1160
01:17:42,929 --> 01:17:50,880
should be doing so thank you so you know

1161
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:53,010
to say that the Keerthi was actually one

1162
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:59,869
of the cores about one of the leading

1163
01:17:53,010 --> 01:18:05,580
authors of a43 79 so yeah for offer

1164
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:09,659
consideration in some occasions and it's

1165
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:13,460
been kind of popular to make 0 and 255

1166
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:16,049
as a reserved value so not use them ah

1167
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,500
but no now we're talking about something

1168
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,900
else

1169
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:23,880
those saw the registration procedures

1170
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:29,848
when the list the assignments then we

1171
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:36,060
list 0 as resorbed so that's another

1172
01:18:29,849 --> 01:18:40,969
part of the table and if further

1173
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,969
questions okay thank you

1174
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:08,150
so I can study direction my name is off

1175
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:12,980
early I'm going to present the draft on

1176
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:16,400
behalf of my co-authors basically the

1177
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:20,780
draft is asking question for us we have

1178
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:24,049
in s our various segments and every time

1179
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:27,380
we define a new segment type we have to

1180
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:38,170
come back to onn and define a new frack

1181
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:41,780
type for validating their segments so

1182
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:44,900
this is the desktop here but it actually

1183
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:48,190
requires software upgrade for the nodes

1184
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:50,960
that are deploying the network and

1185
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:54,740
rather than one end being working in

1186
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:57,200
lockstep with any forwarding definition

1187
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:58,849
that is deployed it started like behind

1188
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,970
like epe

1189
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:04,580
for example is deployed but there's no

1190
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:07,340
fax there's no NN and it causes a lot of

1191
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:11,390
problems and when we when a new fact

1192
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:14,210
type is is is defined and it requires

1193
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:17,480
the software upgrade it also had

1194
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:19,250
implication on the usability from the

1195
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,919
user point of view and now explore a bit

1196
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:23,690
more I had that question when sure they

1197
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:27,080
were presenting the draft and is some

1198
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:30,620
scalability on you so this is some of

1199
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:34,070
the fact that are in the discussion and

1200
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:36,680
you can the main point here is just

1201
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:40,790
sheer amount of information that is

1202
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:44,960
required by the user or by the system to

1203
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:50,300
input in order for us to do a ping to

1204
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:52,820
remote said to have that thing set up

1205
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,740
and it's a lot of information and same

1206
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:57,740
thing is is that I mean let's say we

1207
01:20:54,740 --> 01:21:00,230
define prefix said fact for prefix it

1208
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:04,070
but it doesn't work for flex algo so it

1209
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:07,250
makes a stink one step back and then say

1210
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:09,230
that can we simplify this what is that

1211
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:12,500
we are trying to achieve what is the

1212
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:15,218
data model or for anis our data plane

1213
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,860
and can we make it consistent

1214
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:21,940
definition consistent with the data

1215
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:24,610
model of the SR data plane so that it

1216
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:28,058
works once for all for all the fact that

1217
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:30,759
exist today and they're coming future so

1218
01:21:28,059 --> 01:21:33,219
that's the problem statement to simplify

1219
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,630
the process the second routing is all

1220
01:21:33,219 --> 01:21:37,239
about simplification of network

1221
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:39,429
operation and we have a problem here we

1222
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:43,659
cannot hide that problem the other thing

1223
01:21:39,429 --> 01:21:47,469
is also that if you look at enforce I

1224
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:50,739
can remove that that when you have clear

1225
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:53,499
node said you do not know the target

1226
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:59,669
ahead of time because let's say if you

1227
01:21:53,499 --> 01:22:05,260
go between the node 2 and then 4 and

1228
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:07,800
node 3 are peers said here notes said so

1229
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:10,840
they share the said the decision whether

1230
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:14,559
the message will end up with more number

1231
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:18,099
4 or no number 3 depends on load balance

1232
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:21,639
again node 2 and node number 1 who's the

1233
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:23,289
node asking for ping does not know that

1234
01:22:21,639 --> 01:22:26,229
decision so it cannot fill in the

1235
01:22:23,289 --> 01:22:29,079
information about the egress we're

1236
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:32,110
supposed to receive the packet all it

1237
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:34,929
knows where this it is cities a row ties

1238
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:37,539
by note to the seat value is X but I

1239
01:22:34,929 --> 01:22:40,570
don't know how node 2 is going to load

1240
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:42,249
balance that said and where my target is

1241
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:45,280
going to end up for this thing it will

1242
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:47,800
all depends on mu 2 behavior not what I

1243
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,320
can control same thing when I have a

1244
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:54,670
pair Regency between node 2 and node 3

1245
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:57,699
at node 1 when Isis and I'm pinging a

1246
01:22:54,670 --> 01:23:01,269
Jensen said I don't know which link

1247
01:22:57,699 --> 01:23:05,110
would be selected so I cannot select

1248
01:23:01,269 --> 01:23:07,840
that and we have in our LC we have

1249
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:11,589
method that okay for pereira Jensi just

1250
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:15,099
put 0 so I mean we have X to get around

1251
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:16,659
it but we don't have a solution in the

1252
01:23:15,099 --> 01:23:19,719
other drug the shader presented we said

1253
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:24,070
let's send all the possible there could

1254
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:26,380
be many many and then and then hope one

1255
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:28,099
of them would be there is it increased

1256
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:31,780
complexity

1257
01:23:28,099 --> 01:23:36,709
and it makes when I'm really like behind

1258
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:40,159
so solution is really look at the SR get

1259
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:42,050
a plane the SR data plane simple you

1260
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:45,169
have a segment idea and that segment

1261
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:47,629
idealized by somebody this is the common

1262
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:50,119
denominator it did it doesn't depend on

1263
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:53,719
the seat type what's the type is in all

1264
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:56,659
it does not depend on say step back and

1265
01:23:53,719 --> 01:24:00,320
then simplify the facts definition that

1266
01:23:56,659 --> 01:24:03,648
works for all sit type now and that may

1267
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:06,079
come in future as well since this is

1268
01:24:03,649 --> 01:24:11,479
build on the data model this will work

1269
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:15,530
for sure now here's the definition of

1270
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:17,599
the sit again yes our CID and the C

1271
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:20,148
designer for some simplification for

1272
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:22,609
some use cases like bindings it we also

1273
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:25,550
include optional LSP endpoint which is

1274
01:24:22,609 --> 01:24:31,039
if I know who should be responding I can

1275
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:33,829
put it that information but I'm not

1276
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:36,409
going to go this busy slide but there is

1277
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:39,648
an exercise that is done whether this

1278
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:41,780
definition works for all sit types that

1279
01:24:39,649 --> 01:24:44,269
we have defined or we have to define

1280
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:46,219
future or it doesn't work the answer is

1281
01:24:44,269 --> 01:24:49,519
yes I mean you can review it I can come

1282
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:55,119
back to it if there are more if there

1283
01:24:49,519 --> 01:24:59,510
are more time remaining but I'll go and

1284
01:24:55,119 --> 01:25:01,639
illustrate a few example first so in

1285
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:06,469
this example we have prefix SID

1286
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:11,869
now here the prefix said which is for

1287
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:14,469
flux I'll go 0 and flexible 128 current

1288
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:19,629
definition of prefix said does not work

1289
01:25:14,469 --> 01:25:24,169
for any alga the flex will go 0 and

1290
01:25:19,629 --> 01:25:25,820
there they will attempt to modify the

1291
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:28,280
fact but it goes through the same

1292
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:31,789
problem so how it will be done is

1293
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:36,940
basically mode 1 was just simply say I

1294
01:25:31,789 --> 01:25:40,420
want to ping a label

1295
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:44,440
Edward ties binode r8 this is the only

1296
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:46,600
information that is carried now we pick

1297
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,849
here agency said because agency it is

1298
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:51,700
difficult it is for prefix F so when it

1299
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:55,300
comes to no date no let will say yes I

1300
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:57,610
am the assignor for this said and yes

1301
01:25:55,300 --> 01:26:00,610
this level match my table and then

1302
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:03,460
response goes back to the originator now

1303
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:05,589
we take this example and try to address

1304
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:07,480
the PAL region see which is not

1305
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:14,260
addressed by the RLC today the better

1306
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:17,500
agency case cannot be verified if in

1307
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:20,470
today because it saves agency is zero

1308
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:22,570
zero so here we have ninety seven

1309
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:24,490
seventy eight which is a pair of agency

1310
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:29,920
between link 1 and Link two between node

1311
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:32,590
7 and mode 8 in in this example the fact

1312
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:36,310
would be choosen again this is agency

1313
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:41,320
they advertise by note 7 ok and this

1314
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:42,820
agency value is 93 78 so this is what is

1315
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:45,700
the bare minimum information that is

1316
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:49,740
required when the packet goes to note

1317
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:52,000
eighth note 8 and it can optionally

1318
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:54,880
contain the end point but end point is

1319
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,620
not mandatory but packet comes to note

1320
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:03,880
eighth note 8 can then verify that this

1321
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:06,700
is not a local this is a rise by 7 so

1322
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:08,980
see this 7 is my 3 neighbor and it

1323
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:11,050
verifies that it is this matching on the

1324
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:13,360
interface I receive this packet on with

1325
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:17,050
the pair region see there is a row ties

1326
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:19,540
by that node so in this case 93 78 so it

1327
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:23,320
can easily verify from his low local

1328
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:25,930
table that information so it works for

1329
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:31,059
parallel see it will work for the EPE

1330
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:33,970
cases as well and all now this is peer

1331
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:37,780
note said it works the same way because

1332
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:42,900
the common denominator is node 7 is eric

1333
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:45,550
izing and i jen Z which is 93 78 now

1334
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:47,469
packet comes to node 7 and it can either

1335
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:49,979
go to node 8 or 88

1336
01:27:47,469 --> 01:27:54,789
either way the receiver will say that

1337
01:27:49,979 --> 01:27:57,309
the arrow tiser is not me it is let me

1338
01:27:54,789 --> 01:27:59,499
check if it maelstrom labor does it

1339
01:27:57,309 --> 01:28:02,019
allocated this agency did I receive

1340
01:27:59,499 --> 01:28:03,820
packet on the right interface or not and

1341
01:28:02,019 --> 01:28:06,039
then it will respond so it doesn't

1342
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:08,079
matter how seven is doing is load

1343
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:10,539
balancing the packet may end up at node

1344
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:12,369
eight and it would respond if it right

1345
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:14,739
interface choosen packet may end up no

1346
01:28:12,369 --> 01:28:16,869
deity yet it will respond if his right

1347
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:18,699
interface is choose him and if his end

1348
01:28:16,869 --> 01:28:21,400
of the wrong interface wrong neighbor

1349
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:23,320
then it the response will be negative as

1350
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:29,709
well so all the validation would be done

1351
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:32,799
and it works so in a nutshell we are

1352
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:37,119
trying to simplify the segment routing

1353
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:39,699
FAQ by defining fact which is goes back

1354
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:43,989
to the common denominator of the data

1355
01:28:39,699 --> 01:28:46,360
model in segment outing it will do it's

1356
01:28:43,989 --> 01:28:48,759
done for ease of operation because then

1357
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:51,699
user don't have to input all different

1358
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:56,729
parameters needed and we saw the

1359
01:28:51,699 --> 01:28:58,808
complexity of all the FAQ and it is

1360
01:28:56,729 --> 01:29:01,599
defined such a way that I mean it would

1361
01:28:58,809 --> 01:29:06,189
be consistent with any future segments

1362
01:29:01,599 --> 01:29:07,719
that would be defined and 4-iron

1363
01:29:06,189 --> 01:29:09,550
registry I will skip this this was a

1364
01:29:07,719 --> 01:29:11,829
question lower from you on the mailing

1365
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:15,489
list it's consistent with with whatever

1366
01:29:11,829 --> 01:29:17,949
you decide but it is really an effect

1367
01:29:15,489 --> 01:29:22,388
type of the TLB one sixteen or twenty

1368
01:29:17,949 --> 01:29:24,478
one we already discussed this i'm karis

1369
01:29:22,389 --> 01:29:28,059
a spring working group in the other

1370
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:30,070
discussion that will discuss also in

1371
01:29:28,059 --> 01:29:32,860
amperes in spring but the fact

1372
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:34,509
definition in more especially spring but

1373
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:37,329
we'll let chair decide how they would

1374
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:39,849
like to proceed with that they would

1375
01:29:37,329 --> 01:29:41,259
like to ask for feedback there is some

1376
01:29:39,849 --> 01:29:44,110
discussion that going on with sure

1377
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:46,389
though we try to connect and pass the

1378
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:47,799
prophets but well not able to and then

1379
01:29:46,389 --> 01:29:53,999
we have meeting tomorrow that we will

1380
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:56,769
discuss more on this one observation is

1381
01:29:53,999 --> 01:29:58,809
here as a matter of simple and

1382
01:29:56,769 --> 01:30:01,179
simplifying things i think we are trying

1383
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:04,960
to pack lot of information

1384
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:08,610
in one thing which I do not agree and I

1385
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:11,409
will tell you the example so for example

1386
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:17,650
can you go back to the slide where you

1387
01:30:11,409 --> 01:30:20,290
have note 1 2 & 3 so this one no the

1388
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:23,650
biggest one the very big me yeah don't

1389
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:27,190
go back at the very beginning when you

1390
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:29,860
had parallel sits enough yeah this one

1391
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:32,769
so so you here you claim that note 1

1392
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:36,639
will not know which interface chorus so

1393
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:40,659
I am talking more let's say BGP egrets

1394
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:41,980
adjacency seeds so today in BGP addition

1395
01:30:40,659 --> 01:30:45,879
since it when it is advertised in the

1396
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:48,129
BBC pls update we along with our label

1397
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:50,080
we also advertise the if' index of the

1398
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:52,989
router 2 from where the packet will go

1399
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:54,940
out and there is always also if already

1400
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:57,909
a field which tells out where what is

1401
01:30:54,940 --> 01:31:00,669
the if' index on which node 3 will

1402
01:30:57,909 --> 01:31:02,860
receive the packet so that way note 1 or

1403
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:05,409
knows by a controller or something it

1404
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:07,000
can know given a level what is the if'

1405
01:31:05,409 --> 01:31:10,420
index from which the packet will go out

1406
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,550
from 2 and what interface 3 will receive

1407
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:15,699
and there is already other droughts

1408
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:18,340
which is which are there to add all the

1409
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:20,678
information listed represented regarding

1410
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:22,360
given a node all the like if you talk

1411
01:31:20,679 --> 01:31:25,480
about the set set what are the

1412
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:28,710
interfaces local road as well as remote

1413
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:32,400
node which will be known to the node 1

1414
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:35,880
can answer then yeah what I said is that

1415
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:39,280
node 1 does not know how node 2 would

1416
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:41,080
load balanced any given pink packet

1417
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:43,139
based on the hashing that is putting in

1418
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:47,500
the pink packet whether it will land on

1419
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:51,550
node 4 or node 3 it would not know okay

1420
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:56,350
so the only way to do is to pack the

1421
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:59,980
entire list of possible peer node in

1422
01:31:56,350 --> 01:32:04,060
fact and this is bringing complexity for

1423
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:06,419
both ingress and egress how you expect

1424
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:09,670
the operator to input this data I mean

1425
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:12,639
it's just going out of proportion and

1426
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:13,910
it's too complex for user to use it be

1427
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:17,230
world will

1428
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:18,470
for simplicity we are asking not more

1429
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:22,400
complexity

1430
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:23,810
I mean think of it I mean ICMP you don't

1431
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,639
need any of this I mean people are

1432
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:28,460
operating I could be six network for it

1433
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:44,030
for ages and and you don't get into

1434
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:47,000
these delicious comment I had was Greg

1435
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:48,590
norske a city and I would like to use

1436
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,580
this example that what you mentioned

1437
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:53,480
ecmp

1438
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:56,510
yes it simply is challenging but I don't

1439
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:59,349
see how you can guarantee that with your

1440
01:32:56,510 --> 01:33:03,260
method york's for all possible

1441
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:05,690
downstream from two paths that they

1442
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:08,090
simple because when the message is

1443
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:11,839
received by receive note let's see if

1444
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:14,780
i'm not for I'm gonna check who's the

1445
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,640
advertiser of this said if not me okay

1446
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:20,570
that means the room it's a remove it is

1447
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:23,300
an agency see that's type okay it's the

1448
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:27,469
guy with a tie thing is my upstream

1449
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:31,010
neighbor yes what is the value if you

1450
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:33,530
did he wrote I this value for this sit

1451
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:35,450
on the interfere I receive the packet on

1452
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:41,000
and that's all I have to verify it will

1453
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:45,320
work regardless how you explore or downs

1454
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:49,970
all paths from to so how you can reach

1455
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:52,960
from two to four and all explore all

1456
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:57,170
three links from two to three because

1457
01:33:52,960 --> 01:34:02,510
that's what important and in LSP thing

1458
01:33:57,170 --> 01:34:04,580
if you look at this map so two will be

1459
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:07,970
your responder and to where we listen

1460
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:09,920
list you what is downstream and then you

1461
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:13,250
can use this information to reach

1462
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:16,190
explicitly of each possible path so I

1463
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:19,850
think that yes there might be some value

1464
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:23,179
on doing downstream responding on behalf

1465
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:26,990
of advertising but it must be

1466
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:27,740
complemented by advertiser responding

1467
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:30,800
and very

1468
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:32,450
buying the back yeah but when to respond

1469
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,670
it exactly know how is glued load

1470
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:37,519
balance so to knows information so we

1471
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:41,540
are not talking they will end to a wrong

1472
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:44,870
guy and we cannot do you need to explain

1473
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:48,620
in your proposal is how you guarantee

1474
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:50,809
that their head and the one can control

1475
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:56,380
the information in the packet that you

1476
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:59,180
construct so it reaches all possible

1477
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:00,890
edges that that's that's an alternate

1478
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:02,180
problem that's not the problem we're

1479
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:05,090
trying to solve that's the problem

1480
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:08,180
exporting the tree ok and then you can

1481
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:09,710
change the load balance a parameter and

1482
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:12,140
you can achieve this but but the point

1483
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:15,590
your problem the point is that when to

1484
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:18,620
respond back to the tie with the da snap

1485
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:20,360
DD map it can include the exert

1486
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:25,700
interface information because it knows

1487
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:28,339
how it's going to do the load so the

1488
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:30,800
comment that I have is the problem that

1489
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:33,400
you talked about in the beginning of

1490
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:36,020
your slides that we have these EPS it's

1491
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:38,599
implemented but we don't have om facts

1492
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:40,250
implemented for those that's a real

1493
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,350
problem but there is different way for

1494
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:44,660
solving it right so when we define a new

1495
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:46,640
set we also define the fact for it we

1496
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:48,920
make it mandatory right so that that's

1497
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,570
another way of solving that problem so

1498
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:52,460
that those all those upgrade problems

1499
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:54,830
and other things you talked about that

1500
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:57,860
won't wouldn't exist if we had done it

1501
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:59,840
this way but we didn't do it that way

1502
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,910
and we are in the situation now at least

1503
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,430
going forward we can make sure you know

1504
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:07,040
any a new cell that comes in comes along

1505
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:08,630
with no effect for that it's not only

1506
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,870
one in fact but it's also the

1507
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:13,460
information that is needed this one

1508
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:15,470
think about this information and there

1509
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:20,990
are operators sitting here they can say

1510
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:28,250
that a case like human come online and

1511
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:31,280
out of my order characters not possible

1512
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:34,130
but that's not necessary you know this

1513
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,599
information is it has been advertised in

1514
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:37,760
the network and there's one guy who

1515
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,100
knows this information one node in the

1516
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,510
network who has all this information and

1517
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,640
that should be capable of

1518
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:45,950
preparing the FAQ which is totally

1519
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:48,020
incrementation right well to achieve

1520
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:50,360
what to achieve what so you can verify

1521
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:52,010
control plane and you get data from the

1522
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,989
control plane to verify the control

1523
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:56,270
plane so what do we achieve by putting

1524
01:36:53,989 --> 01:36:58,870
all this complexity in the system we do

1525
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:58,870
not achieve anything

1526
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:06,440
synchronization verification and and

1527
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:08,180
with this from what with what you're

1528
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:13,129
proposing you're completely taking away

1529
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:15,290
the control you cannot get it unless you

1530
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:17,030
get the information from the user and

1531
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:18,800
from a source which is not control you

1532
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:20,900
cannot verify something by getting

1533
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:25,540
information from the very source very

1534
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:25,540
source that you are trying to verify ok

1535
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:33,560
if you see MPLS ping and traceroute the

1536
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:35,390
RSVP or LDP the Heron prepares the fact

1537
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,890
and it sends it and head and how does it

1538
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:39,560
learn it it's a control plane learning

1539
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:45,739
right so that that's what we are trying

1540
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:47,630
to propose I'm pinging this tunnel and

1541
01:37:45,739 --> 01:37:50,030
it knows what is the fact of that tunnel

1542
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:52,010
it doesn't ask a PCE or some other

1543
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:54,410
control entity it is the one that has

1544
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:56,150
installed that tunnel it is the one that

1545
01:37:54,410 --> 01:38:02,989
installed the tunnel ID is the one that

1546
01:37:56,150 --> 01:38:05,239
selected in effect setting of the tunnel

1547
01:38:02,989 --> 01:38:06,200
so whoever sets of the tunnel right will

1548
01:38:05,239 --> 01:38:08,089
have that information

1549
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:10,700
in case of our sweep it was the head end

1550
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:12,680
in case of SR it's the controller so

1551
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:13,820
Weller sets up the tunnel should have

1552
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,680
all the information

1553
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:17,599
yeah but whatever information that has

1554
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:19,550
there learnt through bgp LS and this is

1555
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:26,330
a control identity you you take that as

1556
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:28,190
a master but you get it from control

1557
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:30,620
plane you're trying to verify it I mean

1558
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:37,910
that's an N and n the complexity here as

1559
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:40,820
well I mean there is a new something

1560
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:42,530
called as nil FAQ in RFC 8 0 to 9 which

1561
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:44,330
is pretty much doing the same thing what

1562
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:46,309
you're proposing a little differently

1563
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:48,690
yeah but there is no validation in nil

1564
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:50,520
FAC this brings validation

1565
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:53,160
at least there is a that can be a

1566
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:56,460
forwarding to invalidation you could

1567
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:59,460
send a video and then you verify the DD

1568
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:07,050
empty in your next router you know yeah

1569
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:10,020
but if you want to use some generic om

1570
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:12,330
variation I feel that already exists and

1571
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:13,949
maybe you can take it off one we can

1572
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:16,590
take it offline but I mean there is no

1573
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:33,949
validation that in fact does it is there

1574
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:37,260
in the RFC Mukul from juniper networks

1575
01:39:33,949 --> 01:39:39,660
one comment for B for BGP ep6

1576
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:42,090
those seats are special in the way that

1577
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:44,610
if you talk about three routers one two

1578
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:49,530
and three those labels are allocated at

1579
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:52,139
node 2 node 4 node 3 and node 3 has no

1580
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:53,460
knowledge about that label ok so the

1581
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:56,070
flow chart which you have right that

1582
01:39:53,460 --> 01:40:02,489
will fail I know you do not can you go

1583
01:39:56,070 --> 01:40:05,070
and dig it offline the EP nodes is level

1584
01:40:02,489 --> 01:40:07,919
is allocated at node 2 and the LSP ends

1585
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:09,540
right at node 2 so node 3 has no

1586
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:12,540
knowledge of that level so when you do a

1587
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:15,719
ping from the Headlee that LSP has to

1588
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:20,969
terminate at 2 if it is if it's a prefix

1589
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:23,100
it yes it would right so it will end

1590
01:40:20,969 --> 01:40:25,320
EPC it's a little bit different and here

1591
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,850
the validation has to be done or for the

1592
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:28,650
outgoing interface not the incoming

1593
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:30,780
interface most of thing what you have

1594
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:33,269
talked about labeled corresponding to

1595
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:34,139
the incoming interface but if it's that

1596
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:38,699
if you were different

1597
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:40,530
we can take it offline bit words all

1598
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,460
right from Jennifer I did review your

1599
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:43,769
draft

1600
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:45,660
gave you comments on the list yeah in

1601
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:48,030
general I you know I'm okay with

1602
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:50,760
generalizing the effect but not dropping

1603
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:53,219
information that this allow us to do

1604
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:54,900
control table data play validation so

1605
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:57,270
I'm ok with abstraction but with

1606
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:58,589
abstraction you lose data that you need

1607
01:40:57,270 --> 01:41:02,070
to validate

1608
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:02,530
so if you don't if you can find a sweet

1609
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:03,820
spot

1610
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:06,540
in the middle but do you have the

1611
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:08,710
information and you're generalizing a

1612
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:19,510
monkey but there is a couple of other

1613
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:23,560
comments also that I gave yesterday that

1614
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:25,120
comment look if my main thing is that

1615
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:27,340
this is too much information for any

1616
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,809
user to give if you use control plane we

1617
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:31,780
are fooling ourselves so why bring that

1618
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:37,570
complexity okay that's my comment we can

1619
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:39,820
take it off fly on a controller to tell

1620
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:41,380
me the information that is the packet

1621
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:45,400
coming on the right missus so it is

1622
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:48,190
complex your approaches know if I have

1623
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:51,219
an IEP I have local database that I see

1624
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:53,169
this guy I wrote I this this said yes if

1625
01:41:51,220 --> 01:42:01,720
I receive on the right interface yes and

1626
01:41:53,170 --> 01:42:04,660
in anyway yeah so let's take it offline

1627
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:06,970
but but I disagree we yeah I think it

1628
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:08,860
works any it being benefit of the

1629
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:10,750
industry will bring simplification we

1630
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:13,389
would not have to keep chasing this

1631
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:25,570
stack after fact after fact it is a

1632
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:27,790
problem thank you I prefer that we

1633
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:30,719
actually let people talk to point before

1634
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:34,330
they actually respond and not

1635
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:37,420
interrupting talking actually about

1636
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:42,370
those Safari Sandra they do the same

1637
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:44,710
thing this time it was useful but think

1638
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:47,410
about in the future we let people talk

1639
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:50,490
the people make that point before you

1640
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:50,490
try to correct them

1641
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:10,099
so tarik has done us a service he

1642
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:14,200
actually introduced a font that actually

1643
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:18,310
disappears when we put it up on the IDF

1644
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:23,320
so if I remember correctly as it said

1645
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:26,660
the synonymous flow label drafts and

1646
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:29,000
it's gone there

1647
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:32,360
now I'll go back and I'm not going to

1648
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:40,190
use that slide we have three different

1649
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:43,490
drafts that the main author Stewart told

1650
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:46,070
me are stuck and I try to figure out how

1651
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:49,969
and I try to write down what was the

1652
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:55,610
problem and Stewart says you got it

1653
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:58,880
almost right so I kind of stepping back

1654
01:43:55,610 --> 01:44:02,660
and let Stewart try to explain what the

1655
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:04,640
issue is and where we should go from

1656
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:06,860
here

1657
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:15,170
I would prefer if we get a simple

1658
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:20,089
solution right let me explain where this

1659
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:21,770
is that's in pretty good shape I need to

1660
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:25,370
read it through again but it doesn't

1661
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:30,170
need much work it could go through to to

1662
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:32,930
last call the solution draft pretty good

1663
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:36,470
shape I need to read it through it could

1664
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:38,840
go to to last call except for one thing

1665
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:40,100
by the way they do I forgot to refresh

1666
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:42,350
them I'll refresh them when I get back

1667
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:47,690
to my office at home next week and I can

1668
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:50,480
got the sources again so which is a tank

1669
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:54,530
filled which is you as was requested by

1670
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:56,450
a group of implementers in order to

1671
01:44:54,530 --> 01:45:00,469
simplify the internals of their

1672
01:44:56,450 --> 01:45:06,590
operating system that is that is caught

1673
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:08,660
up by the control draft now several

1674
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:09,860
corporate lives that go I stood at the

1675
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:11,840
front of one of these meetings and

1676
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:15,380
introduced this control graft

1677
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:17,449
very simple scheme that largely George

1678
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:21,469
and I put together a lot of work from

1679
01:45:17,449 --> 01:45:24,559
George and it doesn't require us to

1680
01:45:21,469 --> 01:45:26,690
touch any of the other control planes so

1681
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:29,630
when I stood up here people said no no

1682
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:31,848
no Stuart we need an rsvp-te solution we

1683
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:35,420
need an LDP solution presumably we nee

1684
01:45:31,849 --> 01:45:39,409
now need a solution for the iGPS

1685
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:42,920
and I have not had time or the funding

1686
01:45:39,409 --> 01:45:45,530
or anything to do this and I've been

1687
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:50,239
requesting other people help me here so

1688
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:53,300
I can do one of two things three things

1689
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:56,089
I suppose we could feel the tank filled

1690
01:45:53,300 --> 01:46:00,790
in here as reserved and take a risk that

1691
01:45:56,090 --> 01:46:05,300
we got the size right or we could

1692
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:08,920
control plane that I originally proposed

1693
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:15,860
and if people want another control plane

1694
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:18,139
eventually they can write it or until

1695
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:22,159
someone with enough time and bandwidth

1696
01:46:18,139 --> 01:46:24,020
to write the the control plane document

1697
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:25,848
that describes all of the mpls control

1698
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:30,280
planes but though they come forward and

1699
01:46:25,849 --> 01:46:30,280
they write it but it's stalled because

1700
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:36,259
this working group said we want

1701
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:43,040
something much more complicated and I

1702
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:45,560
haven't got the time to write it we had

1703
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:49,250
a controller with would that replace the

1704
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:52,040
one in the middle as the one doing

1705
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:54,770
allocations for anonymous all right so

1706
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:56,690
so so this is the this design here

1707
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:58,610
actually has a lot of Merit right

1708
01:46:56,690 --> 01:47:00,348
because it doesn't require you to touch

1709
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:03,250
the real control planes it sits

1710
01:47:00,349 --> 01:47:07,670
underneath the real control planes and

1711
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:10,909
yes if the OEM system says it wants to

1712
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:14,570
do this operation then a label is

1713
01:47:10,909 --> 01:47:16,848
transfer is sort of silently inserted to

1714
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:19,639
replace it so that actually has a lot of

1715
01:47:16,849 --> 01:47:20,869
Merit as a system and no one I don't and

1716
01:47:19,639 --> 01:47:22,190
then people I don't think we don't know

1717
01:47:20,869 --> 01:47:24,589
look at the minutes people didn't object

1718
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:24,860
to that they just said we want a lot

1719
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:25,590
more

1720
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:28,369
we want our

1721
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:31,469
sleepy and we won ODB and etc and

1722
01:47:28,369 --> 01:47:33,799
someone wants to write them I would be

1723
01:47:31,469 --> 01:47:33,800
happy

1724
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:41,040
I've been struggling with this for some

1725
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:46,610
time and what I'm trying to understand

1726
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:50,099
is it that way of going forward with

1727
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:52,889
something very similar to what you have

1728
01:47:50,099 --> 01:47:56,790
here simple solution but actually

1729
01:47:52,889 --> 01:48:00,300
putting the hooks in to actually allow

1730
01:47:56,790 --> 01:48:03,090
anyone that wants to do very much more

1731
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:06,719
than want to do that and how the battle

1732
01:48:03,090 --> 01:48:10,139
so remember there's one thing the the

1733
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:12,150
tag field that I put in is in the data

1734
01:48:10,139 --> 01:48:14,810
plane it's transmitted with every packet

1735
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:17,219
and so I'm always very nervous about

1736
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:19,949
doing anything in the data plane unless

1737
01:48:17,219 --> 01:48:27,599
it's perfect because it's very expensive

1738
01:48:19,949 --> 01:48:29,580
to change its agent Farrell I have two

1739
01:48:27,599 --> 01:48:32,940
questions but I reserve the right for a

1740
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:34,650
third question the first question is

1741
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:36,900
just to check that I'm not miss reading

1742
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:40,320
something all three of these drafts are

1743
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:42,659
currently expired yes yes certain my

1744
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:46,280
mistake I will refresh them no that's

1745
01:48:42,659 --> 01:48:51,210
fine that's what I wondered by from fun

1746
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:54,080
second question is to the specific point

1747
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:58,190
of the control plane why don't we just

1748
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:58,190
document what people have implemented

1749
01:49:00,949 --> 01:49:05,699
I'm not sure that it I think whether

1750
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:08,280
anyone's actually implemented it either

1751
01:49:05,699 --> 01:49:10,230
right and that and then I will exercise

1752
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:14,429
my right to the third question why are

1753
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:18,570
we debating last column documents that

1754
01:49:14,429 --> 01:49:21,480
people haven't implemented because

1755
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:25,159
people tell me they want an RFC but I'm

1756
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:25,159
fine with whatever we decide to do

1757
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:38,450
so that left us with another question

1758
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:40,820
but I actually okay actually we have

1759
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:42,349
been taking these two documents through

1760
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:44,929
the working group and people say

1761
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:49,250
wouldn't obsess they want to progress on

1762
01:49:44,930 --> 01:49:52,850
so that's why I'm pushing for a solution

1763
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:57,230
that we actually make them RFC's if

1764
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:58,850
there are suggestions that while this is

1765
01:49:57,230 --> 01:50:01,160
not implemented it will never be

1766
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:05,900
implemented so why should we bother if

1767
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:08,300
that's the but I do hear people who say

1768
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:14,570
I would like to have the RF seeker and I

1769
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:16,250
would like to build it sorry Ryan

1770
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:19,070
Hoffman from Telus I haven't been

1771
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:20,780
following your work but it would seem an

1772
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:23,420
applicable action to this would be a

1773
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:26,150
mirroring SID that on hop-by-hop way I

1774
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:28,430
gave a secondary action to produce a

1775
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:30,440
copy of that frame for diagnostic

1776
01:50:28,430 --> 01:50:33,110
purposes that's kind of what it does

1777
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:37,099
yeah I would think operators would be

1778
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:38,269
quite interested so I am find this you

1779
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:40,070
know what there's on a package of work

1780
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:43,220
we wanted it when I worked several

1781
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:48,200
employees ago several people have said

1782
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:50,030
they want it it's just they want a more

1783
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:51,650
sophisticated control plane or finding

1784
01:50:50,030 --> 01:51:01,509
someone to write it I misunderstood you

1785
01:50:51,650 --> 01:51:04,250
sorry anyone but it's smarter than I am

1786
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:07,550
anyone have an idea what you should do

1787
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:11,000
my take is that we should actually go

1788
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:14,630
with the simple solution we have but

1789
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:20,510
make sure that it has a possibility to

1790
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:22,370
be extended you if you want it all right

1791
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:23,960
I'll take a look at the bits that are

1792
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:25,970
embedded in the control plane and make

1793
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:27,950
sure that in the data plane and make

1794
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:30,110
sure that they're either probably

1795
01:51:27,950 --> 01:51:34,220
adequate or we can change them if we

1796
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:36,790
need to without mass destruction George

1797
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:39,770
you know say something about this yes I

1798
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:43,140
haven't looked at the draft in several

1799
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:47,850
years indeed I am retired

1800
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:52,890
anomaly anyway so uh do we have a

1801
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:57,000
requesting process ID in the initial

1802
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:59,250
exchange because if we did then you know

1803
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:05,160
somebody who wants it to be requested

1804
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:08,490
through RSVP or LDP or BGP could make

1805
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:12,410
build an implication that says okay ours

1806
01:52:08,490 --> 01:52:20,190
he's going to request this thing and

1807
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:22,740
then the request comes back to RSVP it's

1808
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:24,299
just this just yeah population maybe I

1809
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:32,160
should talk to you offline and take you

1810
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:34,280
out a retirement for a few minutes just

1811
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:52,470
tell me what you want me to do that

1812
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:58,380
which was for the minutes okay that

1813
01:52:52,470 --> 01:53:02,660
sounds like it would work for me so this

1814
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:06,920
is the end of the meeting in Montcoal

1815
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:06,920
next time is Singapore

1816
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:16,440
couple of months out so have a good week

1817
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:18,060

1818
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:22,710

01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:31,610
