00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,879
many people in here have read this

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,280
thoroughly but if not I will leave it up

9

15
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,309
TN Ren my co-chair here we are the

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,129
chairs for the ops area working group

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,640
session we will kick this off and we

18
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,789
have a fairly packed agenda though not

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,320
as packed as some in in the past the

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,930
good news is we've seen a lot of mailing

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,779
list activity this time around we've got

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,420
some new adopted documents as well so

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,549
we'll cover those after the ops area

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,619
working group portion we will hand it

25
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:28,979
over to our area directors to do the ops

26
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:32,009
area portion of the meeting before we go

27
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,979
any further may I ask for a jabber

28
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,990
scribe a jabber scribe only and I'm kind

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,060
of looking at Joel yeagley over here in

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,699
the corner of my eye Joel has agreed to

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,609
do it that's fantastic in terms of

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,789
minutes we do have an ether pad you see

33
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:50,100
the link up there I'm currently in it

34
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:52,619
but what I did last time was I just

35
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,869
transcribed this off the YouTube thing

36
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,170
and that worked pretty well so I'm gonna

37
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,299
say we'll do that again however we would

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,299
appreciate that if anyone wants to note

39
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,549
something down in one of these sessions

40
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,729
and one of the presentations please join

41
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,590
the ether pad and Mark that in there so

42
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,409
we can capture it officially in the

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,060
minutes that would be fantastic

44
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:17,079
you see the link to the slides there the

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,940
slides are posted in our

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,910
Genda are sorry in our material section

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,490
for this meeting and they are in the

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,280
order that they will be presented we

49
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,070
have four remote presentations this time

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,290
but the most I've ever had is zero

51
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,350
remote presentations so this is

52
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,160
substantially more we'll see how that

53
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,200
goes

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,380
they've all been notified we work with

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,299
meet echo so we will will attempt to do

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,000
the remote presentations when they come

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,560
up have people sign the blue sheets I

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
think they just came back up to the

59
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,290
front if we need some blue sheet action

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,390
Jian Ren will go and deliver that please

61
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,579
make sure you sign so that we can always

62
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:05,010
right size the room for future meetings

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:08,800
any questions anything with the agenda

64
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,929
what we are going to do is cover these

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,090
documents where the status of our

66
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:18,600
adopted documents are and then go into

67
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:21,930
the end of the presentations okay so

68
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,299
where we're at right now we have four

69
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,060
one just got adopted recently for

70
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,480
working group documents the TAC acts

71
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,959
draft is gone through a round of iesg

72
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,619
review the authors have replied to most

73
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,830
of the discusses we are awaiting a

74
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,350
updated revision of the tac-x draft I'm

75
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,450
told I contacted the author's they

76
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,700
weren't able to do one prior to this

77
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,980
meeting however they expect an update to

78
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,010
address the discusses as have gone out

79
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,350
on the mailing list in the next two

80
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,799
weeks so we will expect to see an update

81
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,620
then we recently adapted the network

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,540
telemetry framework on draft that has

83
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,420
become a working group document that's

84
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,510
been presented here a couple of times

85
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,570
the secure device initialization that

86
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:18,339
Warren and others have written that was

87
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:20,290
recently adopted that has got some good

88
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,080
initial feedback and it might be in a

89
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,180
fairly stable state so we would

90
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,219
encourage all of you to read all of

91
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,419
these drafts and comment on the mailing

92
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:35,100
list and finally just last night I think

93
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:39,099
the tac-x a yang module draft became a

94
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:42,699
was switched over and this is a

95
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:45,160
complement to the radius portion of the

96
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,490
ITF system module to be able to

97
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,889
configure tax server parameters and that

98
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,259
will be presented the updates of that

99
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,300
and some open issues and and requests

100
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,650
for feedback from the working group will

101
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:07,300
be presented this morning questions on

102
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:09,758
that so as I mentioned we've got ten I

103
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,009
believe ten maybe only nine

104
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,479
presentations nine presentations Thank

105
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:17,500
You tanner um that will be going through

106
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:24,150
today if there are no agenda bashers we

107
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,150
will kick things off all right bow

108
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:54,810
I'm here to give some updates about

109
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:58,590
draft ITF tacos yeah so this is as the

110
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:02,220
chair said it's just a zero working

111
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:06,929
group trapped and they love their

112
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:10,050
changed right now is right now the

113
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:18,240
TECO's young draft is only contains the

114
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:20,880
tacos Tess oh here it's a yeah just a

115
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,569
little closer so people can hear okay

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:30,780
so right now the tacos plus only

117
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:35,039
contains TECO's client parameters here

118
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:38,210
is the tree structure of the tacos class

119
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:44,219
young right now for this version and

120
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:51,109
this version we address the comments

121
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:55,469
from the Middle East and now like the

122
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:59,400
like the sauce interface and vrf

123
00:06:55,469 --> 00:07:05,550
interface right now this is the edit

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:08,849
since last meeting for now there's still

125
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:13,289
some issues here the first one is the

126
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:17,069
down Rev TECO's protocol it's now as the

127
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:20,389
chair said is under the ISD and but it

128
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:25,050
the tacos truck prodigal right now is

129
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:26,729
information mock draft and will be

130
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,270
published as information I've received

131
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:37,830
so our job is too dependent on this

132
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:40,859
protocol so we see the comment from the

133
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:45,349
melon is that it from idiot he proposed

134
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,169
to discuss it in the working group so he

135
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:50,740
he he

136
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:54,789
said that we should be that the ad knows

137
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:59,650
that and should approve this it's okay

138
00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:04,659
then the next one okay can I just real

139
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:07,688
quick on on this Ignace one do you see

140
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:10,120
any issues in insofar as this draft

141
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:14,110
configures the server parameters for tax

142
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,279
if this is a down ref as all yang

143
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,560
modules that I have seen have been

144
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,939
standard documents or standards track

145
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:25,089
documents so would this be a an issue it

146
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,839
knows what Vilnius probably not the fact

147
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,999
is that most of the modules are defined

148
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,828
for the standards tax protocols and the

149
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:36,940
tactics is informational so that is the

150
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:48,099
source of this okay I wouldn't see a

151
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:52,240
problem as such the next the next issue

152
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,459
is the also from Elliot that since the

153
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:00,060
working group may have the plan to

154
00:08:54,459 --> 00:09:04,689
define the takos plus plus like TRS

155
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:08,589
extension so maybe that extension will

156
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:15,310
affair affected that a whole the TECO's

157
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:19,899
young model structure so here we think

158
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:23,859
there could be two options here because

159
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:27,010
one is that from the chair that Joe

160
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,100
proposed to will be do another

161
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:35,860
augmentation or next release of this

162
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:41,010
draft to address the TRS extension later

163
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:43,870
and the other choice is the we can leave

164
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:48,399
transfer choice for flexibility in a

165
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:52,089
young model so like to hear what the

166
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:55,019
working group think about this feedback

167
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,019
on on this item

168
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:05,930
Ignazio Donna's right now the document

169
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:09,199
that is being in energy relations about

170
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:12,520
tactics the work on what is beyond the

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,670
tax with different transports and

172
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,730
extensions that's obviously it's not

173
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,959
chatter it or is not happening that was

174
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,870
an agreement that the working group

175
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,630
first pushes the tactics tactics flow

176
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:31,150
and only then the new work over the new

177
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:34,490
item starts and now are you certain that

178
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:36,920
the way how you model the the TLS

179
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,450
extensions were that will be what the

180
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,400
working group wants to see from a

181
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,800
transfer perspective for the new attacks

182
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,680
or for extended tactics this seems a

183
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,229
little bit kind of timing wise premature

184
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,459
okay

185
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:53,870
I'm not saying that this is the wrong

186
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:56,510
way to do things but in my view the work

187
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,030
on the follow-up of attack tactics

188
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:03,650
protocol should happen first and then

189
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:06,650
the Halloween okay I speaking is just a

190
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:09,079
contributor I agree I think the it's it

191
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,930
is the seems premature I would I would

192
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,900
just say when that work happens as that

193
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:25,400
work evolved that might lead to an

194
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:28,900
augmentation okay the the other issue is

195
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:33,740
also from admin he haven't actually

196
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:36,530
proposed this comment at their first the

197
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:40,250
beginning of this draft young because I

198
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:44,500
think right now the system model already

199
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:47,300
defined the the like how to use the

200
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:51,440
local authentication and together with

201
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:56,000
radius and tech Hawks no not include

202
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,990
TECO's but we propose that echoes tech

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,380
ax plus young model so this should be

204
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:07,730
also be considered to be integrated into

205
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:11,449
system young model so right now although

206
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,799
we already defined Atticus client but

207
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:20,089
we still need to define the system

208
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:24,579
authentication extension to include the

209
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:29,839
Texas authentication methods in it so

210
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:34,040
for now we we don't have the think out

211
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:38,029
solution to address that I think it

212
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:43,459
needs to be a dropped to address this

213
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:47,299
like a systems and triple a draft to do

214
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:49,959
another augmentation because I think

215
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:54,339
there's also a comment from radius

216
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:58,488
extension working group they they don't

217
00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:04,730
like the system Triple A just include

218
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:08,559
the tax plus of authentication they want

219
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:13,489
to have whole if if it's a triple a

220
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:16,339
system triple a draft but I also think

221
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:19,999
maybe we can add a section to give

222
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:24,290
example for like what will the system

223
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:29,929
authentication would be like if the

224
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:33,829
tentacles plus would be added into it so

225
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:38,419
right now I I don't have answer for that

226
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:47,899
so I think it's belongs to Opera's area

227
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:50,179
so I'd like to hear the eighties gospel

228
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:53,559
donors what am I thinking for this is a

229
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:56,350
sort of a simple change do it here and

230
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,410
well as you call it an example section

231
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,959
going a net mode way and publishing a

232
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,939
draft which changes one line there as

233
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,638
think it will take free by DT of cycles

234
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:09,799
and that will result in probably over

235
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:14,029
engineer system this is something like a

236
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:15,889
point fix especially given the

237
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,759
discussions about the versioning and

238
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:21,139
changes of the models themselves

239
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,910
possibly taking them out at some point

240
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:25,160
of time away from an RFC publishing

241
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,319
process this seems to be a more

242
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,300
technical way so do it here in from that

243
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:34,699
pot okay they own the system document

244
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,079
but it seems to be more practical that

245
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:40,910
this assault here it will simply be

246
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:47,329
faster okay so I would choose that the

247
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:51,920
second one okay I also had the comment

248
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:56,660
from the John Hursley he his he said

249
00:14:51,920 --> 00:15:00,349
that the current TECO's counter include

250
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,620
the not include that connection opens

251
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,269
count but for like single connection

252
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:11,300
case then the TECO's connection may be

253
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:15,889
more than one session so maybe we can

254
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,508
add sessions count so I also like to

255
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:24,680
hear more comments from the working

256
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:27,319
group so can someone oh I think it's a

257
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,819
like detail one I will yeah just

258
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,979
speaking as a contributor I think that

259
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:32,959
makes sense

260
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,089
yeah sessions counter makes sense to me

261
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:42,649
at least okay I will add this one to the

262
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:46,189
update dropped so that's all this issue

263
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,680
is related to this drop right now so I

264
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:51,829
will resolve the comments from because

265
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,008
John has me propose a more editorial and

266
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:58,160
also some technical drafts comments from

267
00:15:55,009 --> 00:16:02,410
so I will next up I will resolve these

268
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:07,189
comments and together with this issued

269
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:09,439
proposed so I like to hear more comments

270
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:12,399
and suggestion from the working group so

271
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:16,550
that's all furthest thanks I would say

272
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,110
we'd all like to hear more comments as

273
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,649
well but it sounds like you have another

274
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:24,050
action to at least handle the initial

275
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:28,430
authentication piece as an augmentation

276
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,680
here we're whether or not another draft

277
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:34,430
about a more fleshed out Triple A

278
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,079
happens that could be proposed but seems

279
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,870
like that's another piece before we can

280
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:44,839
we can keep progressing this okay I will

281
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:48,530
good mile on that Oh

282
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:59,000
any other questions on tack x+ yang

283
00:16:48,530 --> 00:17:01,400
module module okay do we have any time

284
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,869
so Ignis has asked do we have any time

285
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,869
line win I just - you the primary editor

286
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:11,599
slash author what do you think your ETA

287
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:14,479
is on the changes that you want to make

288
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,159
oh I will within the two weeks and we

289
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,760
will update a new one so that's in two

290
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:25,130
is I think after that it feels like it's

291
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,020
it's getting - it seems like a fairly

292
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,610
straightforward yang module reads that

293
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,090
way to me we've taken out some of the

294
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,010
triple-a stuff I think we would be ready

295
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,870
to move to last call unless there are

296
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,379
any blocking issues that come up on the

297
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,239
list

298
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,890
I think as well no in fact that was my

299
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,360
question it's not about when to publish

300
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,150
the next version but when you believe

301
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,100
that you have addressed the community

302
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,290
comments and socialized that with the

303
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,600
user base and you will think that this

304
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,960
will be done so in a sense when this

305
00:17:50,600 --> 00:18:00,199
model can be considered stable and

306
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:05,990
shipping I think right now our product

307
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:12,170
already support this in our so I think

308
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:16,520
it's and also we take in count of other

309
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:19,870
vendors comments like from Cisco and I

310
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,870
think it's quite stable

311
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:37,649
another yep I think so this draft is

312
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:42,700
about sd1 service delivering model and

313
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:46,929
right now it's a the first version of in

314
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,840
the video one and so I just give a brief

315
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:56,049
in description of what it's Estevan

316
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:58,240
service model is so it's this SQL

317
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:02,470
service is a connected connection

318
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,590
service will be offered between one two

319
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:09,669
or more sites across this is all

320
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:13,658
customer sites and could be use a one or

321
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:17,500
more underlay networks and what this

322
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:20,760
model for we think the it's just a

323
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:25,330
further service crud service provider

324
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:28,750
scenario and that this model is used for

325
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,570
service providers service box traitor to

326
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,490
dynamically create modified the as

327
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:38,279
divine service components the components

328
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:40,870
could be like at a new site or an a new

329
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,710
VPN connection between the sites and

330
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:51,520
also at some applications ala C

331
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:56,529
component so things last IETF meeting we

332
00:19:51,520 --> 00:20:02,580
have such changes and first we have a

333
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:07,210
new co-author chose a co-chair is

334
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:11,970
chairing the muf application community

335
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:17,950
and sd1 project is under his lead so

336
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:21,929
he's very familiar with SQL service

337
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:27,720
staff manager so we with his help we

338
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:31,740
make the the sp1 and EF as to UM project

339
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:37,059
alignment with this draft we added the

340
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,940
mouth related references now enough has

341
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:42,030
already published its

342
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:45,210
dropped specification about SQL service

343
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,610
attributes and we also add the

344
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,380
terminology comparison because in that

345
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:56,719
way our draft is more will be more

346
00:20:52,380 --> 00:21:02,100
easily to n standard by the ITF

347
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:07,050
traditions so this is a main changes and

348
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,990
we also made the whole editorial change

349
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:13,760
the entire trapped to be better aligned

350
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:17,610
with math project and readability and

351
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,820
besides all this we also highlight this

352
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:25,409
ice as divine application based policy

353
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:28,200
service sayings as Devon it's quite

354
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:31,590
different with a traditional hu huiqian

355
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,940
and our European it has application

356
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:37,830
based multi pass selection feature so

357
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,950
there's a lot of policy related this

358
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:46,159
this multi pass selection policy so this

359
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:49,620
is the main changes and they also add a

360
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,280
section to - hi

361
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,699
elaborate what's of difference with the

362
00:21:52,280 --> 00:22:00,090
OSE draft

363
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:04,950
it's proposed being RTG WG so that's a

364
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:09,600
them the elbow changes and for the OSI

365
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:13,340
model difference here is the major

366
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,439
difference the major difference is our

367
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:19,290
SD one service model which is a quite

368
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:24,210
high high level interface to the

369
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:27,110
customer we its upon the users or

370
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:31,220
request service will do some

371
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:34,020
infrastructure service like sites

372
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:38,190
connection and also application policy

373
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:41,280
this is it's a very high level one for

374
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:46,080
the for this model it will not be aware

375
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:50,280
any like real underlay resources here

376
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,980
but for OSE model the assumption is

377
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,399
quite different they the field

378
00:22:52,980 --> 00:23:00,450
Estevan infrastructure service is just a

379
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,630
within their wonder domain as d1

380
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:07,559
managers a scope so they don't want to

381
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:10,590
touch anything about the sideway peon

382
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:13,918
part they just want to do the OS e

383
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:17,129
gateway service between the two domains

384
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,700
so right now they have the OS e gateway

385
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:25,350
service model and they also but they

386
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:29,100
also have a past service very symbol of

387
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:33,840
is as d1 our model is application policy

388
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,928
but they just touched the application SL

389
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,320
a based a policy that's because the

390
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:44,669
because across domains inter domains

391
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,010
there the need to make the different

392
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:50,660
domains have the consistent policy in

393
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:55,290
that way the SOA can be guaranteed

394
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,980
across the domains so this is a major

395
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:01,500
difference

396
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:06,179
it's the OSE dropped so now I think I

397
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:09,720
changed to both of you Aquarius the

398
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:13,260
difference the two models the Aquarius

399
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:17,400
difference yes I am part of the other

400
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:22,169
drafts ah sir so we hope that the

401
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:27,200
disrupter has two components so it can

402
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:27,200
easy be understandable okay thank you

403
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:34,549
and for right now I think they're the

404
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:39,360
drugs open this issue may be the first

405
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:42,270
we think whether because right now

406
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,699
Chow's it's already the co-author of

407
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:47,450
this draft so we would like to hear

408
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,809
whether the working groups think this is

409
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:56,090
enough for the math working project

410
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:58,889
alignment so we like to hear whether

411
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,399
because in that way we can update the

412
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,159
draft

413
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,490
so Charles can propose a changes to the

414
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,990
math community to ask the comment so I

415
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:11,770
think

416
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:16,260
in this way we can make the a better

417
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:19,690
alignment with the two standard edition

418
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,550
yeah Charles cycle so um you know I have

419
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,590
been working with within meth they're

420
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,290
aware of this work that's going on the

421
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,970
one thing that makes it a little bit

422
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,889
tricky is you know meth is more of a

423
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,020
closed membership-based organization

424
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:35,650
right so a lot of things that happen in

425
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:38,139
meth are by default private to the

426
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,630
members and it's you can make effort to

427
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,630
share things like not just to be a

428
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,460
liaison but there's other mechanisms to

429
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,890
so but the you know so doing the work

430
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,350
within IETF and then coordinating back

431
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,750
to meth just makes things easier because

432
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:56,800
in IGF everything's you know open kind

433
00:25:52,750 --> 00:26:00,040
of by default so in terms of layers on

434
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,659
though are working with meth are we

435
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,570
comfortable with just sort of this

436
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,430
informal you know I'm working in both I

437
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,800
think there there's other people who

438
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,690
would be working on you know in both

439
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,000
communities or do we need something more

440
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,530
formal you know that's kind of the

441
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,320
question here Donna's a sexually

442
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,750
question channels to you draft board is

443
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,760
coming from my own oxide how much of the

444
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:29,160
coordination is happening between no

445
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,160
noggin meth on their requirements side

446
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:37,030
so I'd say you know that that's that's

447
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,379
evolving I'm not active in Oneg but my

448
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,690
understanding of the history is that

449
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,280
meth anona I kept not been able to work

450
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:48,310
together very well them both coming into

451
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:56,830
IETF with drafts has kind of helped

452
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:58,600
force some interworking it's not a done

453
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,210
deal but one of the things that looks

454
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,520
quite likely now is that both will be

455
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,260
worked on within meth because if you

456
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,750
look at the overall meth architecture

457
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,300
there's a lot of the first draft that

458
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,400
we're doing now is from a subscriber to

459
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,139
a service provider but there's also

460
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,110
within math service provider of a

461
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:19,210
service provider interfaces which is

462
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,010
very similar to what a vendor to another

463
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,530
vendor

464
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,690
would look like which is what the OSE

465
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,370
draft is doing so meth just hasn't

466
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,650
gotten to that yet it's not that they

467
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,780
don't plan on doing that so it would fit

468
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,120
very nicely into the Islamic

469
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,010
architecture and I think methanoic

470
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,020
seemed to be they're still discussing

471
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,080
but it seems more promising that they

472
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:43,470
will work together on that and perhaps

473
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:55,320
by both being in that to be determined

474
00:27:43,470 --> 00:28:00,240
but so I think for the OS e estimate

475
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,040
dropped I think in later Oh in the

476
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,230
future we we should align the

477
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,440
terminology of the two drops I will

478
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:11,340
relieve the working groups comments to

479
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:15,960
to Steve because he's not here at this

480
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:19,010
time at IGF so and I also propose using

481
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,830
like grouping statement on the component

482
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:26,129
model component to allow reuse like the

483
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:30,330
site VPN application policy grouping so

484
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:32,549
in that way maybe this two dropped will

485
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:39,928
not have too much overlap with the

486
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:47,720
modeling so that's so I like to hear

487
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:52,410
they're working groups and thoughts on

488
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:55,110
on this I before or if anyone is going

489
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,799
to come to my question maybe you know

490
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,490
maybe you don't

491
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:03,929
what is the routing working groups

492
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:05,220
thoughts on this on this on their ground

493
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:09,929
is that is that going to be progressing

494
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:17,490
forward what is their intent with that

495
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:21,870
work I think from the medallist Karen

496
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,290
asked this question Steve but Steve's

497
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:29,908
think there's because they think they

498
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:32,580
rely on the routing areas expertise on

499
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:34,110
the like inter-domain like different

500
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:38,230
options

501
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:44,168
configuration so he prefers to RT gwg

502
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:48,039
but I I I don't tell him further about

503
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:52,749
what's our like this our SD one motto is

504
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:57,419
if it's will be doing work here so I

505
00:29:52,749 --> 00:30:00,730
like to here maybe we can like a

506
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:03,940
presentation doing some presentation or

507
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:10,059
getting comments from both working group

508
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:13,720
and to work together yeah I I would like

509
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:16,389
to see personally see as a chair more

510
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,359
the discussion where where does it make

511
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:21,609
most sense for this work to happen where

512
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,949
do we have the expertise because it

513
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:28,080
sounds like the coordination with the

514
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:30,940
other stos is useful especially bringing

515
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,340
parties together here at the ITF but

516
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:38,429
where do we have the most likely chance

517
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:42,039
of making this work successful yeah okay

518
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:44,350
actually for OSC Yamamoto chapter

519
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:46,840
actually what is the progressing right

520
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,619
now we didn't do too much updated

521
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,389
besides the terminology alignment so

522
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:54,908
from also point of view we don't we

523
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:58,149
don't have a strong opinion for this

524
00:30:54,909 --> 00:31:00,369
charter where we which working will be

525
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:09,189
right place the duties reveal this to

526
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:12,129
the chair you to decide this business

527
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,379
book donors as divine itself is not a

528
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:18,129
technology component it's it's a mix of

529
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:19,959
of separate technologies bundled into

530
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:23,678
something like a product an idea doesn't

531
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,989
work on that idea works on on specific

532
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,389
sub components of this based on a

533
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:33,480
guidance coming from oh not from a from

534
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:33,479
from some other entities in the industry

535
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:40,749
therefore with this for me personally

536
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:42,999
it's a question whether we understand

537
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:45,909
the requirements of what need what needs

538
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:49,749
to go into the modeling here

539
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:51,429
the other important aspect is that even

540
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:53,979
if we are talking here about a service

541
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:56,349
model the service model eventually has

542
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:59,049
interfaces to the technology specific

543
00:31:56,349 --> 00:32:01,629
models and that is where the biggest

544
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:04,629
gaps I at this time if we are looking

545
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:08,349
into the security side the situation of

546
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:10,238
the modeling various is quite a sad if

547
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:12,218
we're looking into route inside that

548
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:14,499
situation is quite good but again in

549
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:16,389
order to practically be able to use this

550
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:20,049
divine as a service those components

551
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:22,689
need to combine therefore and I'm just

552
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:25,899
now thinking aloud you know the service

553
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,029
modeling probably would have more

554
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:33,369
experience if that is done outside of

555
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:36,039
the idea Annika math probably and IETF

556
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:37,509
here in this case is an owner of the

557
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,729
youngers and modeling language and the

558
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:41,529
guidance of how that should be done the

559
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:43,659
technology specific components which are

560
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:45,549
not in scope of those drafts which are

561
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:49,690
happening there are some documents

562
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:54,539
elsewhere probably are within the scope

563
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:56,709
of IETF and not an OPS a WG but in the

564
00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:00,789
specific working groups focusing on a

565
00:32:56,709 --> 00:33:05,139
technology routing tunneling IP second

566
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:06,609
things like that yeah and this question

567
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:11,309
is raised from a practicality

568
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:13,749
perspective yes as Devon is fashionable

569
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:16,359
buzzword these days and therefore it

570
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:20,759
attracts attention an idea the question

571
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:23,619
is what ITF has sufficient words to say

572
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,809
for the community of the users that

573
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:28,988
let's look realistically as the run is

574
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:30,759
not being standardized in IETF and

575
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:33,119
another thing as divine is not something

576
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:36,700
to standardize this is a collection of

577
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:40,658
technology components and that work is

578
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:43,509
done outside of idea I think this is a

579
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:46,269
requirement from math and math has

580
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:52,239
already defined the service and the we

581
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:56,049
just IDF we just help math to design

582
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:58,269
that they can data model and that is

583
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:59,559
perfectly fine if this is done in the

584
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:03,429
context that I

585
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:05,799
is source of guidance on how to design

586
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:07,749
the thing if we if we are certain that

587
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,179
we have enough of a requirements and

588
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:12,520
that model will eventually match what

589
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,490
they expect and will be usable yes fine

590
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,270
let's do that otherwise if this is a

591
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:20,918
situation that the IDF is trying to tell

592
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,780
the operations community on how this

593
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:29,109
should be done on a parade that probably

594
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:35,250
it's not the right way of doing so so I

595
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:41,619
think the answer is we are not going to

596
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:44,980
describe the requirement or define the

597
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:55,419
requirement in IDF we just use the

598
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:59,140
requirement from math right so Charles

599
00:34:55,418 --> 00:35:01,118
are called Neph 70 the dock that's

600
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,779
already referenced here that that is the

601
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,240
requirements for sd-1 now that's a

602
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,770
Memphis decided that if you made it

603
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,839
publicly known that they're doing a

604
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,170
phased approach there's already a phase

605
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:16,569
2 which is going to add more

606
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,480
capabilities kind of more details into

607
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:22,480
the requirements and the specification

608
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,030
of the service there's almost certainly

609
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,770
going to be a phase 3 rather than wait

610
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,720
and try to get everything MF wanted to

611
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,339
bring this to you know to mark it and

612
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,259
make it public as soon as possible so

613
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:34,960
they've decided to take a phased

614
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,550
approach so these requirements are going

615
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,530
to continue to expand I guess so what

616
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,619
our current approach was yeah let's just

617
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:47,200
reference the publicly available

618
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:50,619
specifications and make it an IETF draft

619
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,930
otherwise we could do the yang modeling

620
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:56,710
work within meth but then we would just

621
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:58,390
really rely on IETF expertise to not

622
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,280
only review and comment on it that'd

623
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:03,069
help us maintain alignment so that

624
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,740
people that try to use the meth service

625
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:07,839
models and tie it to you know the

626
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,910
technology and the underlays that are

627
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,520
actually used that that that could be a

628
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,060
straightforward type of thing so you

629
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,170
know method

630
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,299
need help with that because what I've

631
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,860
seen with meth models in the past is

632
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,510
they kind of sit out on their own and

633
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,150
it's hard to figure out how to make use

634
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:24,970
of any ITF models in combination with

635
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:30,160
them yeah yeah I see this is a good

636
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:32,919
cooperation between math and ITF so what

637
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,779
else again that needs to happen but how

638
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,370
best to do that whether to do the yang

639
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:39,040
models here or in that fight

640
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:41,200
I honestly don't know I just want to try

641
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,180
to give the two groups to cooperate more

642
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,720
and and the one thing that makes me

643
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:49,029
think ITF is better is that working on

644
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,810
these things in the open in ietf again

645
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,270
is the default

646
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:54,610
whereas in meth I've been trying to make

647
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:57,070
meth more open and put out early

648
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,690
versions of things and it's possible to

649
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:02,350
do that it just it's a little bit more

650
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,240
painful and there will be some lag in

651
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:07,779
between when the working group within

652
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,689
meth there don't kind of bless iterate

653
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,640
like periodic versions of the document

654
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:16,350
to share probably yeah yes I understand

655
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:19,270
I just try to adjust eagerness question

656
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,009
as well Dawn's and well this is one of

657
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,250
the worrying aspects from eyesight

658
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,680
Charles you say periodically does this

659
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:29,500
mean that this this set of drafts right

660
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,770
now or focuses on phase one and nothing

661
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,210
more and once they have the required if

662
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,640
you are working on the requirements for

663
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:40,180
phase two that will be a set separate

664
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,040
model and not just iterative the endless

665
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,040
work on this model here

666
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:56,259
yes so as I mentioned there is already a

667
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:58,959
phase to document it's going to be MEF

668
00:37:56,259 --> 00:38:01,929
71 it's already started and they're

669
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:04,269
almost certainly BMF 72 that's just the

670
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:06,669
way meth rather than du bist versions

671
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:09,038
that's the way math does it only this

672
00:38:06,669 --> 00:38:11,259
time they intentionally said specify

673
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,869
just you know I can MVP type of thing

674
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:15,699
for SD land that's enough 70 knowing up

675
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:16,929
front that they would immediately start

676
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,549
am f 70.1

677
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:22,529
and that's the way they're working on

678
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:25,119
this so it'll continue to add additional

679
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:27,609
SD when related you know service

680
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,140
functionality into it not only that but

681
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:31,328
to start to work on other interfaces

682
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,489
just this is just one interface as image

683
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:35,949
and this is the interface between a

684
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:39,130
customer and of subscriber right there

685
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:40,569
are gonna be sorry a customer and the

686
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,489
service provider though will be

687
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:45,209
interfaces for service provider the

688
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:47,859
service provider and then also

689
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:49,598
north/south interfaces within a service

690
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:53,288
provider where hopefully we'll be able

691
00:38:49,599 --> 00:39:04,479
to leverage a lot of ITF existing yang

692
00:38:53,289 --> 00:39:06,249
models yep you allow a chance to add to

693
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:09,098
something here actually I think that the

694
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:11,229
collaboration between Amy and I idea

695
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:14,409
should be encouraging we're already you

696
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:16,989
know do this besides the Charles look at

697
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:18,400
in BO and we also have our colleague on

698
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:21,429
in that number actually get engaging

699
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,829
this sty activity in amiable happy to

700
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:26,469
coordinated between a Mia and I have an

701
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:28,239
iconic the new also you know came to

702
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:31,630
check out this Mei progress to make sure

703
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,789
online so I think it also we also hear

704
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:37,209
there's some requests from Mei they

705
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:39,369
really want to see how to map you know

706
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:41,769
services there were technicians with

707
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:43,599
online technology so they look into some

708
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:47,738
phone interface of box trailers so they

709
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,469
trying to you know want to get help from

710
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:53,499
the ITF so so that's why we see if this

711
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:57,569
is something we should you know giving

712
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:57,569
to clever ways muf thank you

713
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:03,219
um thanks we're gonna have to take I

714
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:04,869
think we should keep having have this

715
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:06,910
discussion and ask the pointed question

716
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,239
on the list because we are running out

717
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,479
of time

718
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,729
as to what what is this work interesting

719
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:15,879
here and I'll I'll take an action to

720
00:40:12,729 --> 00:40:21,339
start that discussion on list so we can

721
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:25,299
capture some more of these comments okay

722
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:28,690
is there well is there any interest in

723
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:31,509
in this room then of taking up this work

724
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:41,349
of continuing this work for this model

725
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:43,150
in ops AWG onto a few hands

726
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:48,160
well more hands keep going I guess maybe

727
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:49,719
if I wait long enough okay do people

728
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,910
think this document is ready for

729
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:58,390
adoption then by the working group in

730
00:40:51,910 --> 00:41:02,769
its current state less hands but not

731
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:05,288
zero I think we'll take it to the list

732
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:06,758
and see what what the list thinks we

733
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:08,859
definitely want to hear more comments

734
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:18,519
but we're gonna have to move on

735
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:21,449
Thank You Mel I've just been notified

736
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:25,109
that we have a little bit more time from

737
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:28,449
Warren our next presentation will be

738
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:31,589
remote so I'll ask Oscar are you there

739
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:34,449
yeah I'm here can you hear me properly

740
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,930
we can hear you perfectly can you hear

741
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:37,660
us

742
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:40,089
yes I've been hearing you all the time

743
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,999
so yesterday I had a good experience

744
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:46,328
with routine working group so it seems

745
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:48,038
this remote presentation works good and

746
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:52,209
even I can see their eyes in the room

747
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:53,890
now okay can you well yesterday

748
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:56,890
one couldn't interrupt remote

749
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:59,319
presentation so hopefully it sounds like

750
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:03,910
we can talk back and forth great so all

751
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:05,829
your all you okay so I'm gonna do a

752
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,979
presentation today of the layer 3 VPN

753
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:10,609
network model that we submitted the

754
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:12,890
first person in May

755
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:15,680
and recently we submitted a second

756
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:19,308
version it is an initiative by a bunch

757
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,499
of operators who we are trying to we

758
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:24,829
were trying to implement the automation

759
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:30,828
of layer 3 VPN and we took as a starting

760
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:32,809
point the layer 3 SM and we found some

761
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:37,539
things to implement so this is why we

762
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:42,950
were pushing for this network model so

763
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:46,489
next slide please so we're gonna see why

764
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:49,759
do we need a new network model what have

765
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:52,249
we found missing so far in the threesome

766
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:54,739
which are the approaches that we can

767
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:56,328
follow to do this work some

768
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,069
modifications I think I don't mind not

769
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:00,650
gonna enter into the modifications

770
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:03,170
really in detail you have the draft -

771
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:06,019
and the document and the young model to

772
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:08,029
go through them if needed and just focus

773
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:12,459
on the open issues and get more feedback

774
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:12,460
from the community so next slide please

775
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:22,329
yeah so first of all why do we need a

776
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:27,049
new model ok so there is currently an

777
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:29,119
VPN service model the l3 SM and it's a

778
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:32,210
very good model and we do think that it

779
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,730
is a good model to be used in the

780
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:39,109
communication between the customer and

781
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:42,349
the network operator so we believe that

782
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:48,288
for that kind of communication it's it's

783
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:52,460
ideal ok however as it is always seen

784
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:54,980
from the customer point of view a it

785
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,529
does not enter and it should not enter

786
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,650
into some parameterization of the

787
00:43:57,529 --> 00:44:03,769
network resources also does not enter

788
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:08,299
into for example identifying really the

789
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:11,868
PE or the real port that we are using in

790
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:16,220
the in the operators network so this is

791
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:20,390
why when implementing it to be used to

792
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:22,399
what our automation tools call it some

793
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,019
people call it as being controllers and

794
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,470
people call it network restriction there

795
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:27,680
are

796
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,180
several ways of using it in the just in

797
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,390
yesterday's presentation in Ratan

798
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:35,899
trillion working group we explain the

799
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:37,310
different architectural options or how

800
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,839
this model will fit in the different

801
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:42,279
architectural lectures but basically

802
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:44,690
this is the or this model would be the

803
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:49,010
peace between the service orchestration

804
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:51,560
and then network restoration part okay

805
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,970
so it's once you have received the drink

806
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,640
was from the customer and then you are

807
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,410
able to do select which are the real

808
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,200
impose from where the service is gonna

809
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:02,859
be used and it you need to define

810
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,109
resources then model is used for that

811
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:10,160
part okay and this is where we are

812
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:13,250
implementing it in in telefónica and

813
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,828
also other operators plan to implement

814
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:20,329
it in that part okay so please Nessus

815
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:23,420
light please so here I'm gonna just

816
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:28,099
describe very briefly some scenarios

817
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:32,170
where the there were some gaps with l3

818
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:36,560
SM so for example one of them is the

819
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:39,650
specific P identification points also

820
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,750
details about the bidders we think that

821
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:45,050
the keys are the the bidder that are the

822
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:49,400
physical connections to the to the piece

823
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:52,670
so specify which is the encapsulation so

824
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:57,589
in our use cases we have a wide variety

825
00:45:52,670 --> 00:46:01,579
of l3 VPN starting with different kinds

826
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:03,828
of encapsulations so we also need to be

827
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:07,730
able to inform about which are the list

828
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:09,500
of available beers per site so for us

829
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,440
even for both for inventory and for

830
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:15,109
medicine purposes it is it is needed

831
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:20,660
also we have found use cases in our

832
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:25,299
network where the trend is remote so

833
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:31,190
when acid water stitching the l3 VPN

834
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:34,730
also we need to cover a use case with it

835
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:37,810
so that is we need to split layer 3 VPN

836
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:40,900
into several domains you know

837
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:44,470
when orchestrate his resources in

838
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,490
different domains and also related to

839
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,730
his multi-domain

840
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:50,799
be able to configure what we call the

841
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:54,280
VPN nodes which would be like an

842
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,990
abstraction of the of the BRF so just

843
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,270
take into cannot here we are adding two

844
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,399
device conflation okay we are describing

845
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:03,220
here the cells as a whole in the in the

846
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,550
network way and also we found that the

847
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:10,959
room for some more a routing protocols

848
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:15,100
between C and and so please the Nexus

849
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:19,780
knife so I just want to discuss one of

850
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:21,670
them which is that so we had our

851
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,770
original approaching the zero zero

852
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,930
version was okay go for the augment

853
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:30,940
approach okay let's take the three same

854
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:35,049
an extended to with what were off we

855
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:37,900
found missing okay then we realize that

856
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,820
there are a lot of things from the sir

857
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,120
is modeled the customer service model

858
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,650
that we no longer need they were used in

859
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,200
the service orchestration face to make

860
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:53,190
them some decisions and then okay once

861
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,990
not made we don't we don't need them so

862
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:58,180
then we think that this is a better and

863
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:01,270
when we requested for feedback in the

864
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,339
main in this people said okay the prune

865
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,940
honest approach might be better so is

866
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,400
okay

867
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,960
I start with and 3sm remove what is not

868
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,760
needed keep everything related to the

869
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:15,460
service that we need to maintain it to

870
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:17,830
to pull down and then augment whatever

871
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,450
is is needed we know that this might

872
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:23,069
take a long time

873
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:26,470
this might take more discussions in IETF

874
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:29,050
that every SM was even now working group

875
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:31,600
itself or whether it might have some

876
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:35,530
family thing as the kind of

877
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:39,160
augmentations and won't be hopefully not

878
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:41,770
too much I think we can this is a button

879
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,940
approach just in the image we need to

880
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:47,380
define what what do we need to keep

881
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,820
yesterday there were some suggestion of

882
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,750
keeping some information just as

883
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:57,510
optional not mandatory to who

884
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:59,640
sit down okay so this is light please so

885
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:02,040
with the pronoun next and approach we

886
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,810
can we have tried to preserve as much as

887
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,779
possible del through the same structures

888
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:09,900
or within the l3m we will have the VPN

889
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:18,630
service on the side with the list of

890
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:24,090
bidders and inside and add some profiles

891
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:26,460
associated to this VPN nodes so not

892
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:29,610
entering too much more details for that

893
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:35,040
we can discuss it on the list

894
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:38,760
so please next slide so how does it up

895
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,279
to the network deployment so basically

896
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,470
with having a net worth of call as a

897
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,630
collection of bees and in that

898
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:50,759
collection of pieces well we will say ok

899
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:53,760
and we'll ask the PPS node - yes and the

900
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:58,440
bidders will be the physical ports that

901
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:02,130
connect to the piece and these builders

902
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:04,560
can have a several connections over day

903
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:08,880
and these connections to the to the side

904
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:11,580
to the customers are at the side network

905
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:21,480
access so this is how it relates of

906
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:25,920
Icarus this sim or the connection

907
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:28,560
between the customer side and the he

908
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,870
goes to a set of switches and what you

909
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:35,370
do is some different levels of

910
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:37,890
encapsulation or as we mention earlier

911
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:40,670
it's a silly wire to the ultimate

912
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:45,000
basically this is a the main the main

913
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:47,190
concepts ok so just we keep the site as

914
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,710
a logical structure say ok this is our

915
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:52,880
some remote location will be connected

916
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,880
here so

917
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:46,470
so this is where we can put the

918
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,839
resources so for example the artists

919
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:53,220
artists so for example we have observed

920
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:57,540
in many services in telefónica that the

921
00:51:53,220 --> 00:52:01,230
same RTR D is used in all the locations

922
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:04,920
so then we can we can put it here in

923
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:12,030
this profile and associated to a VPN no

924
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:14,520
so then we do this a location on the on

925
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:16,650
the USS level and we pass it today to

926
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,990
the model and then this is in further

927
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:21,000
taking down to that otherwise model also

928
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:24,810
for example in the in the side what we

929
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,670
have for the facade is the the bitter so

930
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:29,490
this is the list of bitter that are

931
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:32,339
associated to that side okay so for some

932
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:36,930
before that for some customer okay you

933
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:38,250
are using this specific bitter and in

934
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:42,390
the Senate were actually have the

935
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:45,810
pointer to that bitter okay so if you go

936
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:49,670
to next slide please just gonna go very

937
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:54,920
quickly next slide please

938
00:52:49,670 --> 00:53:00,210
okay so here in India top we have a

939
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:05,460
least most open issues that people have

940
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:08,460
identified in the many so we have it

941
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:11,040
open it as an issue in github just to be

942
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,500
able to to track it and now we have

943
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:17,490
already solved two of the history issues

944
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,440
and we still have some some open open

945
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:21,950
points so

946
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:24,800
for example how to link the network

947
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:27,169
service young model with other modules

948
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:30,470
for example the topology I am assuming

949
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:32,210
that the net water orchestration London

950
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,828
will controller can expose a topology

951
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,650
and this topology

952
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:40,690
it contains the PE so maybe it's easier

953
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:44,720
that we can just do a live reef from the

954
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:47,000
network service model to those nodes in

955
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,299
the topology for traffic engineering the

956
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,010
result Radian initiative in in TS to map

957
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:58,280
the service to the to the set of tunnels

958
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:59,660
that might composite so I think if we go

959
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,970
for this approach we need to link with

960
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:04,759
that work and also the composed opinion

961
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:08,359
which goes for more complex multi

962
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:11,089
operator VPN scenarios so so far we have

963
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:14,390
received good feedback on the main in

964
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:17,779
this from operators and people do not

965
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:23,799
potentially can can implement it we have

966
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:26,240
a set of vendors that have their

967
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,319
implementations of going of this model

968
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,899
so we can take it to to the network so

969
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:37,869
we think that this is a topic that it is

970
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:41,300
in the scope of the ITF and we'd like to

971
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:46,730
continue working on it and we plan to

972
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:51,349
post a new version just soon just fixing

973
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:53,450
some some bugs and keep collecting more

974
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:58,520
and I would like to hear also from from

975
00:54:53,450 --> 00:55:02,089
you how to move forward these this work

976
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,960
and it's interesting for the community

977
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:08,810
so thank you very much

978
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:16,040
excellent comments quickly on on this

979
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:17,869
the l3 network model iOS card assists

980
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,369
but not less so thanks for his work it's

981
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:21,560
always great when ever we have operators

982
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:23,329
coming in finding feedback on the

983
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:26,089
service models and yes sometimes our

984
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:30,589
iteration on service models so my only

985
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:31,578
question is so those were also operators

986
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:34,160
who came and

987
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:36,559
getting a service model the first one

988
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,670
and they were also from orange and kdi

989
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:45,709
and Verizon if you get their feedback on

990
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:47,779
what you're proposing here a yes I got

991
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:51,379
the feedback is what that the imitation

992
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:54,880
who was aimed at creating the service

993
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:58,880
for the customer of the from the

994
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:02,739
customer point of view so so I think

995
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:08,630
their focus was not exactly they say as

996
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:10,999
as the model so it was like in a higher

997
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:13,910
level so I think that the uses of these

998
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:19,160
models are at different steps in the

999
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:22,420
chain within an operator thank you so I

1000
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,420
have a question for the room

1001
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:30,549
do people feel that this work is

1002
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:30,549
valuable to do here in ops AWG

1003
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:41,420
substantial number of hands went up okay

1004
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:44,269
III think Oscar you had a you you gave

1005
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:46,369
yourself an action item to update you

1006
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:48,649
you're gonna update this draft with some

1007
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,719
of the open issues I was looking at your

1008
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:52,039
github you've got a few of them there I

1009
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:54,410
think

1010
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:56,690
do that and then we can decide to

1011
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,279
progress this for it it sounds like

1012
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:00,049
there's enough interest in the working

1013
00:56:58,279 --> 00:57:02,390
group here and we'll double-check on the

1014
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:06,319
list to keep this work moving forward an

1015
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:06,739
ops AWG okay figure too much Thank You

1016
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,640
Oscar

1017
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:12,529
and from my first Renault presentation

1018
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,819
that went surprisingly well so clear

1019
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:16,969
well the next three are going to be

1020
00:57:13,819 --> 00:57:19,430
disasters yes but I hope that next time

1021
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:28,910
I'll be in Singapore so I can make it on

1022
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:31,640
site okay good morning everyone this is

1023
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:35,529
Hugh I'm here to discuss the framework

1024
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:39,078
for automated service and network

1025
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:40,940
management we see young actually these

1026
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,859
topical actually we set up the side

1027
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,500
meeting to discuss this so we will bring

1028
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:47,119
some feedback so this is also loose

1029
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,869
we actually work together with the many

1030
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:53,599
operator on these workers so go back to

1031
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:56,300
the goal and motivation we sink RINO ITF

1032
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,980
developer huge amount of young data

1033
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,720
model how this model can put it together

1034
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,030
integrate together in the same namespace

1035
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:06,348
so this is something hasn't been

1036
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:08,960
documented anywhere and so so the goal

1037
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:10,310
of this you have to actually try to you

1038
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,150
know come up with it's a young auto

1039
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:16,310
architecture for service management and

1040
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:18,349
network management and and what we

1041
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:20,570
really like to do is to come up with its

1042
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:23,420
common functionality and a framework to

1043
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:25,670
help to build this for a young baseless

1044
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,420
system and in addition we want to

1045
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:31,130
provide a kind line how do you you know

1046
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,980
to to to put a young model at a

1047
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:36,650
different layer together to deliver a

1048
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:41,420
service and also for its kind of service

1049
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:43,880
in enforcement but the we cannot boil

1050
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,640
the ocean so really this work actually

1051
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,400
you know focuses on the young Taylor

1052
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,700
motor integration at a different layer

1053
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,619
or in the same layer so somehow work

1054
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,930
actually we already have some many

1055
00:58:54,619 --> 00:59:00,770
needed caching or we get a feedback from

1056
00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:04,330
some operator we single we want to you

1057
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:05,509
know know to put everything in this

1058
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:08,630
draft

1059
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:13,550
so first up actually whether we should

1060
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:15,230
list all the llamado divine idea for in

1061
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,080
this job actually that's not our

1062
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:20,000
intention because it's a it's very

1063
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,880
challenge we in memory all these young

1064
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,580
data model also maybe we have as a

1065
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,190
yamaraja beverage in other SQ how to you

1066
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:31,069
know put all these together so it's not

1067
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:34,580
a reasonable so we don't cover first

1068
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:38,680
piece second years to any need to pry

1069
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:42,140
inventory of the tools or mechanism

1070
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:46,609
actually one of the example is we have

1071
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:48,980
many OM tools or mechanism and but we

1072
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:51,170
think this is not the folk of this

1073
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,730
worker this book just focus on Youngjae

1074
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:55,490
the model in equation I think a tool

1075
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:59,030
chain is very important but we can leave

1076
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:02,680
this out and and to more focus on

1077
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:05,120
the younger the motor integration also

1078
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:07,609
you know in a society meaning we really

1079
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:12,710
want to address use kept kept up between

1080
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:15,190
ITF Yamamoto and operator really operate

1081
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:18,920
the requirements actually but we think

1082
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:20,810
put this kind of gap adoption in this

1083
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:25,070
job - also not a reasonable

1084
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:28,279
so we DVDs out and another comments

1085
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:29,930
actually from operators ease we talk

1086
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,330
about whether we can provide young

1087
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:35,569
Vinney motor registration we single

1088
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:38,680
already I do have young catalog effort

1089
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:41,030
they actually can help operator to

1090
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,669
figure out how to select the model when

1091
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:47,570
they deploy the service so young catalog

1092
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:49,390
can be a good tours to actually has

1093
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:52,550
these kind of issue so we've this out

1094
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:54,670
also because young to the model you know

1095
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:58,430
many as thought use is so increasing

1096
01:00:54,670 --> 01:01:00,650
model in across the SDO actually this is

1097
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:04,160
something very useful i I think the

1098
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:06,290
weight on one companies so status update

1099
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,009
actually we present this job in the last

1100
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:12,920
idea here meeting him in of office area

1101
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:18,440
and rotting area and a solitary feedback

1102
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:21,590
from the operator and implementer and we

1103
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:24,650
actually based on OBS double-teaming in

1104
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:29,090
is discussing actually some commentaries

1105
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:32,560
by the show and and some other vendors

1106
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:35,690
and we try to address some of the the

1107
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:39,230
issue actually so when maker actually to

1108
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:41,510
revision in them in a previous revision

1109
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:43,370
there were four actually we charge your

1110
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:47,030
chairs that your comms and other vendors

1111
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:49,600
comments and to try to clarify the

1112
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:53,120
module position and a young catalog and

1113
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:56,540
also we actually work which out of the

1114
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,880
operator team actually get a lot of

1115
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,920
feedback the all of them actually many

1116
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,720
of them actually integrate interesting

1117
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,010
in how to integrate a young data model

1118
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:10,009
in a same namespace so so we added

1119
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:12,080
several new car car sir actually from

1120
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:14,420
from operator actually

1121
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,670
and we also you know clarify the scope

1122
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,750
who tried to make it more focused yeah

1123
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:20,930
that's the change we made

1124
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:22,430
and a quick rapid data for the side

1125
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:24,740
meeting actually they started meeting

1126
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:29,810
actually organized on Tuesday morning

1127
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:33,770
and and and we invited many orbiter also

1128
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:36,140
we socialize this sunny meeting through

1129
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:38,840
the man in East and we make it a public

1130
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:41,359
on the side meeting wake up Asia make it

1131
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:45,410
official so the goal is trying to just

1132
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:48,260
cause a gap between ITA moto and in that

1133
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:52,240
Chinese and see what is the right venue

1134
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:55,070
to discuss all addresses kappa so this

1135
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,930
job actually try to cover some of the

1136
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:00,730
pieces try to address this gap how to do

1137
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:04,970
the younger model integration and so we

1138
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:08,480
you know work with china mobile and also

1139
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:13,310
telephony car and for these represent a

1140
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:15,380
young lady motor frame walker and also

1141
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:18,080
China Mobile presented the promised

1142
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:20,840
space and the Colonel's were young they

1143
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:23,810
the model and and telephony campus and

1144
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:28,640
their use case and requirements so we

1145
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:30,230
get a lot of discussion and so here we

1146
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,540
listed the meeting Matt here in a minute

1147
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:35,000
so you can take a look at that so the

1148
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:37,670
outcome actually we we feel actually you

1149
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,040
know people agreed that's there's a game

1150
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:42,740
actually these guys need to be addressed

1151
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,540
and so there's a many way to Jerry's so

1152
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,879
we are actually approach it ad to talk

1153
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,890
about that it doesn't actually we have

1154
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,290
many propose own i thinkin we may create

1155
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:53,120
the many mister to sorta see the

1156
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:55,790
feedback from operator chameleon also

1157
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:58,060
from the implementer or developer also

1158
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:00,410
for this kind of young day the model

1159
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:03,529
integration framework is very useful

1160
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:05,930
towards and also we we should actually

1161
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:11,210
to figure out how to reach out at a real

1162
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:14,060
community with many ways so so one

1163
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:17,990
question from the also the design team

1164
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:20,060
actually we we think you know we try to

1165
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:22,370
address some of this crap actually we

1166
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:26,029
think this kind of tech model

1167
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:28,490
integration framework will be a good

1168
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:32,539
you know starting point to to figure out

1169
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:33,890
how how to address this and so we want

1170
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:35,900
to ask a working group whether it is a

1171
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:38,089
ride-along able to tell bodies whether

1172
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:46,819
it's useful to publish it such kind of

1173
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:54,680
document that's that's all action

1174
01:04:46,819 --> 01:04:59,270
comments on on this draft so personally

1175
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:01,940
more is I guess a contributor I still I

1176
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:04,190
saw your out of scope when I read

1177
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:06,349
through it there still you you list a

1178
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:08,480
lot of the the ietf yang modules how

1179
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:13,160
they fit together what the capabilities

1180
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:15,859
currently are I'm not sure how they how

1181
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:20,180
that structure currently gets to some of

1182
01:05:15,859 --> 01:05:22,700
the the questions and the gaps so for me

1183
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:24,109
it's how do we engage more operators

1184
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:26,180
I've been walking up and made the

1185
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:29,119
comment it's great when we see operators

1186
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:33,098
putting forth what what they want to see

1187
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:36,319
but how how are is is this work going to

1188
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:38,240
fill or help to bridge them those games

1189
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:41,089
you know a single there's a man in

1190
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:43,819
discussing this issue for we listed many

1191
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:45,680
younger model at a different level so

1192
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:48,049
which I do address these that we think

1193
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:52,609
it will be useful use ITA motor as

1194
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:54,980
example to to see how this model can put

1195
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:56,690
together like actually some people may

1196
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,900
such as move to the appendix but we

1197
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:02,089
still single maybe there's some you know

1198
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:05,359
we can you know make it more generic

1199
01:06:02,089 --> 01:06:07,759
doesn't need to know type to specify et

1200
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:09,589
I define a model this is something we

1201
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,319
can coming up actually but we really

1202
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:14,029
want to target to nurture a pleasure to

1203
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:17,470
come up with these common functionality

1204
01:06:14,029 --> 01:06:17,470
a framework yeah

1205
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:24,169
built-in Cisco so not read the draft or

1206
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:26,808
evasion read bits of it so detail

1207
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:30,500
comments but I think having a general

1208
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:32,690
architecture describing how services

1209
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,819
provisioned and new young models and the

1210
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:38,630
layering master I think that's generally

1211
01:06:34,819 --> 01:06:41,210
useful I think an abstract level

1212
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:42,740
such information is handy and explaining

1213
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:45,529
the lifecycle and stuff and I think

1214
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:48,919
that's the after what them back then

1215
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:52,250
which is talking RT gwg was also getting

1216
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:54,619
to yesterday whether there should be any

1217
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,869
specifics about particular models and

1218
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:58,700
how they interact written into a draft

1219
01:06:56,869 --> 01:07:00,980
that I'm not so sure about because I

1220
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:03,828
think that stuff probably needs to

1221
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:05,210
evolve quite quickly and by the time you

1222
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:07,849
go through the specification process is

1223
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,200
not so useful I think that almost there

1224
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:10,700
needs to be on github somewhere or

1225
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,759
something that that's the place where I

1226
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,558
think the sort of running code side of

1227
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:17,029
this which is why I regard that the

1228
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:19,369
relationship between those models is

1229
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:21,650
probably more useful maybe so no there's

1230
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:24,019
not a comment on this draft but I I

1231
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:26,299
would see trying to describe the

1232
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:32,209
abstract architecture as being the key

1233
01:07:26,299 --> 01:07:35,480
piece for me thank you Leon from China

1234
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:37,670
Mobile I think there are more

1235
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,700
coordination work than technical work

1236
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:43,190
but for these thoughts of young model

1237
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:46,098
status and I think it's quite useful to

1238
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:49,339
have a framework as a guideline if that

1239
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:51,890
can help operators understand more what

1240
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:54,529
model has been developing what working

1241
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:56,868
group in such a status so that the

1242
01:07:54,529 --> 01:08:00,529
operator can give more feedback to the

1243
01:07:56,869 --> 01:08:02,750
community how and what wish we could do

1244
01:08:00,529 --> 01:08:05,059
to actually coordinate all this model to

1245
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:09,970
to have a more end-to-end service type

1246
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:12,859
of methodology so I would have thought

1247
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:15,529
the framework would be helpful in terms

1248
01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:21,710
of coordinate all these young models

1249
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:23,509
work happening in place here so robots

1250
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,770
is yeah I definitely agree that pretties

1251
01:08:23,509 --> 01:08:28,580
come to balance being a coordination

1252
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:30,290
problem as well you know just the way

1253
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,969
information when I see actually we also

1254
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:33,679
you know receive a lot of positive

1255
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:36,020
feedback from many operators in this

1256
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,690
idea meeting when people really really

1257
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,199
know the donor realities talk about the

1258
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:42,198
journal

1259
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:45,019
sorry beam energy gave a lot o coulibaly

1260
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:48,608
singer this kind of framework is needed

1261
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:52,529
to have them to deploy the service so I

1262
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:57,000
I think you use what you have this

1263
01:08:52,529 --> 01:09:00,750
I think what at least I've heard here it

1264
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,689
might be useful to divorce some of the

1265
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:06,509
specific yang modules and maybe talk to

1266
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:11,040
again and and see what might be done at

1267
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:12,180
a higher-level framework to do some of

1268
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,509
the things Rob was mentioning about

1269
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:19,859
connect the dots and how one uses yang

1270
01:09:15,509 --> 01:09:23,189
modules together yeah right one more

1271
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:26,670
thing Frank Rock nurse before you jump

1272
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:30,509
to the framework maybe it's useful to

1273
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:33,839
reverse a logic if you I just scan

1274
01:09:30,509 --> 01:09:36,149
through the document and for certain

1275
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:38,250
services you seem to be doing that

1276
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:40,439
mapping exercise that goes across all

1277
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:42,899
these various layers and then at the

1278
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:44,490
same time in your presentation said you

1279
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:47,040
were saying that some of these things

1280
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:48,420
should be out of scope so right now the

1281
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,850
document is a little bit of a mixed

1282
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:53,549
mixed bag of things between specifics

1283
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:55,410
that are not really done to the very

1284
01:09:53,549 --> 01:09:56,880
level of granularity that you would need

1285
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,920
in order to get that actionable and

1286
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:02,280
implementable and at the same time you

1287
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:04,230
have this generic framework that you use

1288
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,300
or that you want to go and derive from

1289
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:07,799
these specific models what I believe

1290
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,100
would be useful is to break this thing

1291
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:14,190
up and maybe initially focus on one two

1292
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:17,520
three initial use cases where you really

1293
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:20,910
do the mapping exercise and really nail

1294
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:23,550
it to the detail and once you have that

1295
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:25,230
learning experience then you can go and

1296
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:27,600
up level that into something that is

1297
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:30,089
more generic if we're trying to do both

1298
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:32,730
things at the very same time it might be

1299
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:35,190
that we're doing disservice to the

1300
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:36,629
generic framework as to the thing that

1301
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:37,889
you don't really spell out to the level

1302
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:40,110
of detail where it becomes actionable

1303
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:42,660
and implementable because the devil with

1304
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:44,849
this mapping exercises in detail there's

1305
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:46,170
multiple layers of indirection and you

1306
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,490
can get it wrong at every single layer

1307
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:49,430
of indirection and then most of these

1308
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:52,080
layers of indirection are

1309
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:54,090
non-deterministic from an implementation

1310
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,800
perspective necessarily right so what do

1311
01:10:54,090 --> 01:11:00,330
you choose which particular counters do

1312
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:02,400
you refer to so I I'd rather see the the

1313
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:04,890
nitty gritty spelled out maybe in a

1314
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,889
different document then while you're

1315
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:10,960
trying to go on

1316
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:14,020
everything into one big bad business

1317
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,780
with Donna's framework is good and is

1318
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:20,560
needed but you cannot deploy a framework

1319
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:23,170
you also need a set of validated modules

1320
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:28,470
that actually work together and do

1321
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:31,360
something of value to the operations

1322
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:34,320
framework is a guidance but that

1323
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,769
guidance should also drive the work of

1324
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:41,049
actually validating the things together

1325
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:43,270
so I think that's similar to what Frank

1326
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:45,850
was explaining probably from a slightly

1327
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:48,490
different angle so both both of those

1328
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:50,890
works I needed and what you are doing

1329
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:53,050
here is in the right direction but this

1330
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:59,170
is not something that can be taken and

1331
01:11:53,050 --> 01:12:00,880
used okay we can put policy this

1332
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:04,740
document and try to make it in motion

1333
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:08,650
Eric yeah thanks Jenny

1334
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:09,330
next stop we have a lot of mud in your

1335
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:14,170
eye

1336
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:27,030
Eliot and then Dan after that on various

1337
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:28,660
mud topics good morning all right so

1338
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:30,519
let's see here

1339
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:32,559
the first thing we'll talk about is the

1340
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:36,580
mud controller selection and then we'll

1341
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:41,980
get into mud reporting all right so just

1342
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:43,240
by way of review when when a device when

1343
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,980
a device wants to be protected by

1344
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:48,880
manufacturer usage descriptions it

1345
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:51,459
publishes a mud URL the Met manager

1346
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,960
picks up a mud file and that mud file

1347
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,700
contains a bunch of access control

1348
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,610
statements those access control

1349
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:59,860
statements can say things like allow me

1350
01:12:57,610 --> 01:13:04,719
to connect to a controller or my

1351
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:06,549
controller now it could also say things

1352
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,040
like let me go to this domain let me

1353
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:11,590
talk to same manufacturer most the other

1354
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,240
abstraction Zoar classes they can be

1355
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:16,240
filled in automatically by the mud

1356
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:18,070
manager but the controller class and my

1357
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,510
controller class requires at least at

1358
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:22,690
the moment some system ended

1359
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:24,550
traitor network administrator input well

1360
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:26,289
the network administrator might want

1361
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:28,420
some help in answering the question who

1362
01:13:26,289 --> 01:13:31,000
should be the controller for this

1363
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:32,800
particular device there are two

1364
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,150
different classes there's my controller

1365
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:38,800
and there's controller my controller is

1366
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:40,360
that does not require there any class

1367
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,539
naming on the part of the manufacturer

1368
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:45,699
just says for this given Mudd URL the

1369
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:47,199
might of my controller should I should

1370
01:13:45,699 --> 01:13:49,210
have access to my controller in the

1371
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:51,190
administration administrator can fill in

1372
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:53,230
that for controller they name a class

1373
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:55,379
the benefit of naming the classes you

1374
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:59,440
can use that across many different

1375
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:04,960
device types so now the question then is

1376
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:06,638
how do we provide a hint to the to the

1377
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:11,650
administrator as to what those

1378
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:15,969
controllers should be so that's what

1379
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:19,388
this draft starts to to flesh out it's

1380
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:20,920
this is for the controller you know this

1381
01:14:19,389 --> 01:14:22,929
is a controller driven approach that is

1382
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,449
to say the controller is declare I can

1383
01:14:22,929 --> 01:14:28,329
be a controller for a particular type of

1384
01:14:25,449 --> 01:14:29,678
device on the controllers themselves are

1385
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:31,480
assumed to have mud files in this

1386
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,130
context and that means by the way at

1387
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:38,199
least at the moment that they're assumed

1388
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:41,500
to have a single purpose they they can

1389
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:43,539
use an extension to declare this which

1390
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:46,269
basically names the classes that they

1391
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:48,280
can control and this up to the admin to

1392
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:51,699
decide whether or not they like the idea

1393
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:54,219
of this controller having access for

1394
01:14:51,699 --> 01:14:57,250
this purpose so that's pretty much the

1395
01:14:54,219 --> 01:14:59,380
draft in a nutshell and so this is how

1396
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:02,679
it works I can clean this guy says I can

1397
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:05,280
control class brand on example.com slash

1398
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:10,929
home owner and these guys all say

1399
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:12,610
forgive me they all put in their things

1400
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:14,170
essentially a permit statement as I said

1401
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:17,530
let me access this thing so you have a

1402
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:19,510
nice rendezvous and so that's this is a

1403
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:20,590
something that we wanted to get around

1404
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:22,119
to in the initial version it was

1405
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:24,489
probably just a bit much for the initial

1406
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:27,009
version of mud it's just nice extension

1407
01:15:24,489 --> 01:15:29,199
that ties a nice bow around the

1408
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:31,599
automation process here now there are a

1409
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:32,990
couple of open questions ok the first

1410
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:34,490
one is that the roll

1411
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,900
itself as I mentioned has to have a mud

1412
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:37,280
file in mud you are Ella meaning that

1413
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:39,259
the controller itself is not an

1414
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:43,160
application there's something we'd like

1415
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:44,870
to fix but at least on the mud list and

1416
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:48,620
I think we this even got to the opt area

1417
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:51,769
working group list this is still a

1418
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:53,540
pretty hard problem the second point is

1419
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:56,810
that manufacturers may want to advertise

1420
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:59,630
which devices can fill in these classes

1421
01:15:56,810 --> 01:16:02,270
from their sites so if I go back to this

1422
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:06,260
picture here it rather than having this

1423
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:09,590
guy say I can control these guys in its

1424
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:12,680
class the other way to do this is to say

1425
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:18,070
these guys can say here are a list of

1426
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:21,770
controllers that can control me now I

1427
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:24,290
can't say quite quite yet which one's

1428
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:25,400
the better approach to do this I think

1429
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,660
we need a little implementations

1430
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,160
experience we need to talk to some

1431
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:30,680
manufacturers it could be that both of

1432
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,480
the right approach one area I want to

1433
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,400
explore is whether we can get the model

1434
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:36,740
right such that it can be used in either

1435
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:39,710
case however I think that's going to be

1436
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:42,889
a little difficult but I think what I'd

1437
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:44,690
suggest is people read the draft I don't

1438
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,800
think it's ready for working group

1439
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:48,530
adoption just yet

1440
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:50,270
but I will be I'm gonna implement this

1441
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:53,120
in the next couple of months it's pretty

1442
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:55,670
easy implementation when you do it from

1443
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,260
the controller side it's really easy I

1444
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:58,790
think Rangga there could probably do it

1445
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:03,140
in 20 minutes with with his headphones

1446
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:05,620
on and to give you an idea I mean I

1447
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:07,940
think it's very easy to implement and

1448
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:10,190
but the only issue is you have to have

1449
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:11,929
some UI elements in there as well to say

1450
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,900
yes these are the things and sort of a

1451
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:17,240
drop-down here are the guys who are able

1452
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,830
to be controllers for this device um in

1453
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,969
some cases if you're the only control

1454
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:22,190
you might just want to fill it in and

1455
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:25,310
say I see this guy is that okay when you

1456
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:27,200
do the initial approval all right so is

1457
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:30,950
there interest in this work anybody

1458
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:35,240
people read this draft interest I see a

1459
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:38,030
couple of hands yep a few hands alright

1460
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:40,610
so yeah for the rest of you read the

1461
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:46,518
draft it's fun I like doing stuff fun

1462
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:48,499
stuff alright questions before I go on

1463
01:17:46,519 --> 01:17:52,159
yeah Tim carrion okay I do have a

1464
01:17:48,499 --> 01:17:58,670
question disrespect with in general with

1465
01:17:52,159 --> 01:18:01,489
mud right so when I look at the RFC the

1466
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:03,380
RFC was you know really oriented towards

1467
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:05,388
you know the URL and you know how you

1468
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:09,079
get that stuff right and it made

1469
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:11,420
secondary comments on what a control on

1470
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:13,150
a controller gave a definition but but I

1471
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,869
don't now I'm seeing more and more

1472
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:17,780
specifications about now I've got a

1473
01:18:14,869 --> 01:18:20,239
reporting aspect to control or whatever

1474
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:23,980
right it's I'm wondering if mud is

1475
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:26,780
turning from URL and simple words right

1476
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:28,638
to a system right where you have these

1477
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,960
controllers and stuff and and so my

1478
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:33,710
concern is is that we've got some

1479
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:36,139
systemic system aspects of this that or

1480
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:37,730
framework I don't care but but how all

1481
01:18:36,139 --> 01:18:39,980
this kind of works together controller

1482
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:42,280
works with a with an agent we had the

1483
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:44,900
same thing in some other places that

1484
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:47,659
that I was actually looking at this work

1485
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,249
to see if if it made sense to extend the

1486
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:52,039
other work that had controllers in

1487
01:18:49,249 --> 01:18:55,159
agents for IOT and other management of

1488
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:56,929
devices in to utilize the mud and

1489
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:59,509
incorporate it but I didn't have the

1490
01:18:56,929 --> 01:19:01,159
framework elements that that I that I

1491
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:03,380
could really understand I could infirm

1492
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:04,879
but I didn't see and so I was just

1493
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:07,550
wondering if there's a if we're gonna

1494
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:10,909
move this from a URL to do two more

1495
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:12,409
systemic that elements is there is there

1496
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:15,138
something that we need to produce for

1497
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:17,329
the industry to I understand what what

1498
01:19:15,139 --> 01:19:19,489
all they had components mud is and how

1499
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:23,170
they interact alright thank you for the

1500
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:26,780
question I'm gonna respond briefly for

1501
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:28,579
for time sake if you look at the history

1502
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,690
actually of the RFC if you go back into

1503
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:31,820
the tracker there was a framework

1504
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:36,249
document and we collapsed everything

1505
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:40,070
into that that mud drop of that mud RFC

1506
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:43,579
the mud consists of what I would say are

1507
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:47,690
three components really the URL the

1508
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:51,999
description file and the the its

1509
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:54,169
interpretation at the mud manager level

1510
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:55,760
what I would suggest is we have an

1511
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,590
offline conversation though about

1512
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,810
whether additional guidance is needed

1513
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:02,390
for industry I'm always happy

1514
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:04,190
I blather on I'm always happy to provide

1515
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:05,720
whatever guidance we think industry

1516
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:08,210
needs in order to implement this and

1517
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:10,310
from a systemic view I was hoping that

1518
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:11,420
we have a reasonably systemic view in

1519
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,450
that document if you're saying that

1520
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:16,340
we're missing then I'd like to correct

1521
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:18,230
yeah it's just that as we're as it seems

1522
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,850
like we're extending things just trying

1523
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,530
to understand what the responsibilities

1524
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:23,030
of the various components are right you

1525
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:25,070
know I think that was kind of missing

1526
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:27,110
other than some short descriptions in

1527
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:28,340
the initial RFC all right let me come

1528
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:32,200
back to that because I have a question

1529
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:32,200
later on in the discussion

1530
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:37,670
I said I think a second team's opening

1531
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:41,420
actually I don't see the whole picture

1532
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:45,260
how these out he divides you know what

1533
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:47,360
is the life cycle the whole IOT device

1534
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:50,540
the management we may mean some

1535
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:53,480
framework or two to see how how it works

1536
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:55,490
mad mad at fit in you this framework is

1537
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,860
not a very clear to me but I think very

1538
01:20:55,490 --> 01:21:02,389
useful to have have these kind of

1539
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:08,179
progress I encourage your draft that is

1540
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:10,910
to say please write one okay so the next

1541
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:14,180
thing is a little different this is work

1542
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:17,510
that Rangga from NIST and I are working

1543
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:19,760
on and this was in response to some

1544
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:22,640
industry interest they say well okay

1545
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,710
great I have my mud file I have I have

1546
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,240
my mud URL output how do I know that the

1547
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:28,520
device is being treated appropriately

1548
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:31,340
within a given network

1549
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:33,290
now if the title of this as reporting on

1550
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:35,480
fails it could also be reporting on

1551
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:38,450
successes I just want to highlight that

1552
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:40,070
might you know I tend to be a bit of a

1553
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:43,550
pathologist so I always look at the

1554
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:45,950
fails in my head so the problem

1555
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:48,020
statement is here it is exactly what you

1556
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:49,970
see there which is what happened for at

1557
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:52,940
least in my mind what happened if the

1558
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:54,410
device isn't getting the access that it

1559
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,089
needs even though it's putting out the

1560
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:59,750
mud URL and a mud manager is

1561
01:21:56,090 --> 01:22:02,450
interpreting it all right now so we have

1562
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:05,410
an initial version of a draft which is

1563
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:09,260
draft Lior ops area group mud reporter

1564
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:13,459
so imagine roughly speaking what's

1565
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:15,199
reported is a think of ARF

1566
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:17,780
you got Murray in the back of the room

1567
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:20,209
there all the way in the back actually

1568
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:24,438
who did this thing called ARF which is a

1569
01:22:20,209 --> 01:22:27,590
reporting mechanism on how Demark is

1570
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:30,050
being used for instance to reject or

1571
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:32,360
quarantine email the same sort of

1572
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:34,369
concept applies with mud you've deployed

1573
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,619
this mud URL you put deployed this

1574
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:40,610
device now what happens you know is it

1575
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:42,679
is it acting it is is it being used

1576
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:45,018
appropriately is the device getting the

1577
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:47,539
access it needs and within a deployment

1578
01:22:45,019 --> 01:22:49,489
if you have multiple multiple devices

1579
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:51,289
are some of them getting the access they

1580
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:53,449
need are some of them not getting the

1581
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:56,150
access they need and what information

1582
01:22:53,449 --> 01:22:58,489
does the manufacturer need in order to

1583
01:22:56,150 --> 01:23:02,598
determine a couple of questions what are

1584
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:05,119
those questions okay number one is maybe

1585
01:23:02,599 --> 01:23:06,619
the is the mud file wrong like maybe

1586
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:09,170
he's maybe they've under specified

1587
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:09,949
permissions in the mud file and so all

1588
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:12,469
of a sudden you're seeing these

1589
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:14,299
rejections is the device hacked

1590
01:23:12,469 --> 01:23:16,340
maybe the mud files right the network

1591
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:18,050
management system is operating exactly

1592
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:20,059
as it should be operating but the device

1593
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:24,139
has been hacked and is trying to go in

1594
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:27,889
different directions which by the way is

1595
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:31,789
one of the design goals of mud is to

1596
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:32,989
actually spot that is there a problem

1597
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:34,639
with the mud manager where it's not

1598
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:38,030
filling out the abstractions correctly

1599
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:39,889
is it a problem with say domain lookups

1600
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:42,079
if you have if you're saying please

1601
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:44,360
permit access to domain such and such is

1602
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:46,849
the resolution occurring such

1603
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:49,159
differently between the device and the

1604
01:23:46,849 --> 01:23:52,099
policy enforcement point such that the

1605
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:55,159
device is being blocked even though the

1606
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:57,170
domain maps to a particular to that IP

1607
01:23:55,159 --> 01:24:00,978
address see there's some of the problems

1608
01:23:57,170 --> 01:24:05,780
that you could crop up in a model

1609
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:07,760
implementation so our model needs to

1610
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:10,070
support a little bit of this now this is

1611
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,409
an initial draft give you an idea how

1612
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:14,929
initial just in the span of four days

1613
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:17,119
Rangga went and implemented about 80% of

1614
01:24:14,929 --> 01:24:19,249
it actually he meant implemented about

1615
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:23,150
80% of it in two days

1616
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:25,820
and in those in those two days probably

1617
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:27,049
the draft has changed about 20% in terms

1618
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,610
the model so

1619
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:30,699
maybe even a little bit more so it's

1620
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:32,780
really really actively being developed

1621
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:35,808
but it also leads to a couple of

1622
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:37,099
questions right and the biggest issue I

1623
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:39,320
want to highlight is that there are

1624
01:24:37,099 --> 01:24:40,940
privacy concerns here so the mod manager

1625
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,380
starts reporting this stuff let's say

1626
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:44,150
it's reporting it to the manufacturer

1627
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:46,309
all of a sudden you know what

1628
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:49,699
information is the manufacturing is the

1629
01:24:46,309 --> 01:24:52,130
manufacturer getting that here that they

1630
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:53,509
otherwise wouldn't get and is that

1631
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:55,280
something can we establish an

1632
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:57,619
appropriate permissions model such that

1633
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:01,130
this reporting model is actually useful

1634
01:24:57,619 --> 01:25:05,210
so this is the part where I say run pay

1635
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:07,520
attention because you're very focused on

1636
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:08,989
privacy issues this is where we need a

1637
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,780
lot of guidance we might want to bring

1638
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:14,030
this draft to - perd for instance for

1639
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:16,190
some advice as to how we can have an

1640
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:18,340
appropriate permissions model that that

1641
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:21,199
that succeeds

1642
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:22,820
you know the manufacturer might learn

1643
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,259
some operational state in the locale the

1644
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:26,030
locale might be linkable

1645
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:28,210
on there may be devices where you

1646
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:30,889
definitely don't want to do this for

1647
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:33,079
wear where you might not want to leak

1648
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:35,900
the link the leak the location of what

1649
01:25:33,079 --> 01:25:38,360
you're doing for instance so we need to

1650
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:40,549
think a little bit about this and some

1651
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:43,098
of this information leaks naturally with

1652
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:46,099
mud already just by retrieving a mud URL

1653
01:25:43,099 --> 01:25:47,989
so it may be that there's less of a

1654
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:50,869
concern here that I'm thinking about but

1655
01:25:47,989 --> 01:25:53,388
I think we need some eyes on that and so

1656
01:25:50,869 --> 01:25:56,860
my first question is is there interest

1657
01:25:53,389 --> 01:26:00,110
in this diagnostic reporting sole

1658
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:03,019
question of interests or a few hands go

1659
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:06,589
up actually a number of hands go up how

1660
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:11,750
many people have read this draft see

1661
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:13,849
fewer hands but a few okay so look we

1662
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,290
have some nice heated debates at the

1663
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:17,690
IETF I'm pretty sure we can have a

1664
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:20,059
couple on this one I think it's really

1665
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:22,308
interesting work but it needs a lot of

1666
01:26:20,059 --> 01:26:24,500
eyes to get it just right I don't want a

1667
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:26,929
fast roll I don't want to speed through

1668
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:29,119
this draft but I suggest that the best

1669
01:26:26,929 --> 01:26:31,040
way for this draft to be the best it can

1670
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:32,839
be is for two things to happen number

1671
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,070
one we need manufacturers to look at it

1672
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,860
to make sure they're going to get what

1673
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:40,820
they want out of it number two is that

1674
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:44,059
the IETF this will require substantial

1675
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:46,700
area review in order to really be the

1676
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:49,070
right thing that comes out finally one

1677
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:52,280
last point which is whatever the

1678
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:55,759
manufacturers want to see the deployment

1679
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:57,980
will want to see more that is to say you

1680
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,780
know is is my own deployment working

1681
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:01,910
appropriately and so we probably want

1682
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:06,620
the draft to accommodate that use case

1683
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:08,180
as well and in that context one of the

1684
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:10,190
questions we will have and there are

1685
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:12,770
privacy issues related to this as well

1686
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:14,330
as who is the mud manager in the

1687
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:15,710
enterprise this is an easy case it's

1688
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,570
going to be something adjunct to

1689
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:20,420
triple-a infrastructure for an example

1690
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:23,090
but in the home it's a different kettle

1691
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:24,830
of fish is the mud manager going to be

1692
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:27,740
Google it's going to be Amazon is it

1693
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:31,090
going to be Telus is it going to be

1694
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:34,099
cable comcast you know so there's a

1695
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:36,350
privacy considerations even in the

1696
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,730
deployment so I really do think we need

1697
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:38,720
a lot of eyes and with that I would just

1698
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:43,730
like to say are there any questions

1699
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:46,490
about this work of comments no one's

1700
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:48,910
coming up please do review read this up

1701
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:51,290
I think shins gonna make a comment

1702
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:51,860
another word it is these questions this

1703
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:54,950
you again

1704
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:57,500
so can you okay update all the team at

1705
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:59,179
Santa meeting I didn't see that so I owe

1706
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:01,220
to my tell me I don't know that I have

1707
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:02,870
time yeah we're really running short on

1708
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:04,520
time so if you want to send something a

1709
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:05,930
summary out the ops area working group

1710
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,400
lists they'll be great yeah we had a

1711
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:11,570
good good meeting I'm happy to talk to

1712
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:14,509
you take care thanks next up we have

1713
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:17,120
more mud Dan wing will be presenting

1714
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:19,190
remotely Dan can you hear us yes I can

1715
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:24,559
hear you hear you hear me over there

1716
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:27,469
yep you sound great yeah so let's get

1717
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:30,410
started please so our our goal at next

1718
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:33,350
slide our goal for this document is to

1719
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:35,690
extend mud from what it's doing today to

1720
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:39,700
describe the TLS interactions so mostly

1721
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:43,580
the TLS handshake next slide please

1722
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:46,790
so what we're proposing is to extend it

1723
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:49,610
to look at the handshakes hyper Suites

1724
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:52,820
offered the cipher suite accepted the

1725
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:54,230
ESN I that is in the client hello the

1726
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:57,769
server name and the certificate

1727
01:28:54,230 --> 01:29:00,349
that are in the server hello what the

1728
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:02,630
reason is research has found in their

1729
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:05,720
citations below that there are

1730
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:08,300
mismatches between what happens with

1731
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,920
malware and what happens with what we'll

1732
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:12,950
call legitimate software especially

1733
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,900
running on things the things can be

1734
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:18,739
profiled and a mud profile can be

1735
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:20,750
published indicating what TLS parameters

1736
01:29:18,739 --> 01:29:23,750
are normal for that device to operate

1737
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:25,640
with therefore helping to identify if

1738
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:28,880
that device has malware running on it

1739
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:32,380
the characteristics that we found in

1740
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:34,910
that research is now where it does not

1741
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:36,440
use the same crypto Suites does not

1742
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:38,840
connect to the same servers that you

1743
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:40,429
know behaves differently then the

1744
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,489
legitimate software running on the

1745
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:46,010
device so that's that use case on the

1746
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:48,440
left on it fine and on the right we've

1747
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:51,410
also found situations where we can use

1748
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:54,799
this same technique to detect what I'm

1749
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:56,690
going to call broken TLS so failures of

1750
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,989
best practices such as validating the

1751
01:29:56,690 --> 01:30:01,849
server certificate expiration date

1752
01:29:58,989 --> 01:30:04,429
things like that which have been found

1753
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:08,120
in a wild and we have we have citations

1754
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:11,450
on the next slide on that and and reuse

1755
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:14,360
of the same private key with mutually

1756
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:17,889
authenticated TLS as we've seen in the

1757
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,889
wild next slide please

1758
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:26,330
so there's a lot of reasons that the

1759
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:28,250
software uses you know the legitimate

1760
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:30,290
software running on the IOT device uses

1761
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,820
the same Suites all the time and the

1762
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:35,840
same parameters and it's the same

1763
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:38,239
reasons that browsers do it's to you

1764
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,489
know make the code easier to run and

1765
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:42,169
because they are you know and use less

1766
01:30:40,489 --> 01:30:43,639
footprint and because they are

1767
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:47,120
constrained devices they don't have all

1768
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:49,239
the memory that a PC does so they need

1769
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:52,070
to use viewer crypto sweets and have a

1770
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:53,650
constrained set of operations that

1771
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:58,580
they're using for their TLS

1772
01:30:53,650 --> 01:31:01,400
communications and we've filed a bunch

1773
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:04,570
of devices that were easy to obtain and

1774
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:07,879
cheap and everyone is familiar with echo

1775
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:10,549
Kindle a bunch of Google devices

1776
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:12,770
and and seeing how many different TOS

1777
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:18,110
profiles that they generate following a

1778
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:20,360
model that we've proposed next slide and

1779
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:24,469
this is a bunch of the thiing that we're

1780
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:28,940
proposing you examine and be part of the

1781
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:31,640
specification next slide and a common

1782
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:33,410
question of course is TLS 1.3 encrypts a

1783
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:36,530
lot of it's in the handshake so how

1784
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:37,639
valuable is is this overall and while

1785
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:39,440
it's true it doesn't encrypt the

1786
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:41,450
handshake what is most valuable for us

1787
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,429
to get for the profiles that we're

1788
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:46,250
interested in is what still remains in

1789
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:47,980
the clear with TLS 1.3 and that's all

1790
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:50,210
that I have next slide please

1791
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:51,980
and hopefully earned you back some time

1792
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:55,300
and if you have any questions please

1793
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:59,360
come to the mic or drop me an email

1794
01:31:55,300 --> 01:32:02,930
questions on this work I think Elliot's

1795
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:06,710
coming up hey Dan how you doing what all

1796
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:10,820
right thanks all right so have you have

1797
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:13,580
you tried implementing yet you have some

1798
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:16,820
code Tarot at McAfee has implemented it

1799
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:18,950
yes okay very good good because I think

1800
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:21,170
one of the things can do is maybe get a

1801
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:23,300
couple of others to join in on the

1802
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:24,080
hackathon activities on this too you can

1803
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,220
see you can get a couple more

1804
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,900
implementations but it sounds like a

1805
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:27,670
really great idea I like the the general

1806
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:35,240
direction

1807
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:37,790
cool thanks Benoit clay so it's not

1808
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:40,910
specific about this draft but it seems

1809
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:43,280
that mud became something big recently

1810
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:45,530
right so we went from one R I've seen

1811
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:47,150
observable ug and I was checking that

1812
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:50,059
the mud mailing list now there is like

1813
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:53,360
the hackathon there is this mud maker

1814
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:55,400
there is like seven documents here right

1815
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:58,280
and that that led to the questions that

1816
01:32:55,400 --> 01:33:01,250
were asked before how does all this fits

1817
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:04,250
together so you know isn't it time to

1818
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:06,440
just create a working group what you

1819
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:08,030
combine this together I mean and I've

1820
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:10,250
not been discussing with people Avada

1821
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:12,170
but just thinking you know to me

1822
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:14,480
whenever I want to get like a picture of

1823
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:15,830
everything of muds it's like a mud

1824
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,910
mailing list sometime in update

1825
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:21,530
absolutely G there is a mat maker so you

1826
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:25,539
know just throwing

1827
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:25,539
the stone in the pond like people react

1828
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:33,530
racing working actually I think it is a

1829
01:33:30,489 --> 01:33:38,659
researcher who caused sin to sing idea

1830
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:51,849
how mad people coordinate with seducing

1831
01:33:38,659 --> 01:33:54,289
IT yeah alright so occasionally good

1832
01:33:51,849 --> 01:33:59,119
occasionally I presented to t2 TRG

1833
01:33:54,289 --> 01:34:03,440
however this isn't really t2 t this is

1834
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:06,728
more t2n right the mud never configures

1835
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:10,280
a device mud configures the network

1836
01:34:06,729 --> 01:34:11,420
infrastructure and it's it could be it

1837
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,009
could be addressing more than just

1838
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:16,460
access control I know we have a few

1839
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:18,469
concepts there like around this but it

1840
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:20,599
is all focused on configuring the

1841
01:34:18,469 --> 01:34:23,030
network and never communicating back to

1842
01:34:20,599 --> 01:34:24,860
the device and never actually and the

1843
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:26,420
device should never actually assume then

1844
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,710
that network is actually doing anything

1845
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,239
with this information because there

1846
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:31,519
might not be a mud controller on the

1847
01:34:29,239 --> 01:34:32,650
network so it's a little bit of a

1848
01:34:31,519 --> 01:34:37,249
different thing but we do talk

1849
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:40,159
absolutely and related to benoit's

1850
01:34:37,249 --> 01:34:43,940
question and in the interest of time

1851
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:46,009
I'll discuss this via email more

1852
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:47,178
there's also captive portal discussions

1853
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:48,679
that have been happening on opposite

1854
01:34:47,179 --> 01:34:51,559
working group lists

1855
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:56,059
maybe it is time to consider how is mud

1856
01:34:51,559 --> 01:34:59,929
something to to centralize more and make

1857
01:34:56,059 --> 01:35:02,210
more in its own realm versus versus an

1858
01:34:59,929 --> 01:35:08,539
ops AWG if that work is going to

1859
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:10,130
continue to evolve no I don't mind if we

1860
01:35:08,539 --> 01:35:13,190
work in the working group or work

1861
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:15,499
elsewhere I think Warren was around for

1862
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:17,659
when we and Joel where it was around for

1863
01:35:15,499 --> 01:35:19,820
a lot of discussions around where we do

1864
01:35:17,659 --> 01:35:21,348
all this work and it was it's always one

1865
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:24,558
where you can split it multiple ways

1866
01:35:21,349 --> 01:35:26,539
however one of the things I would like

1867
01:35:24,559 --> 01:35:29,179
us to contemplate in this in the

1868
01:35:26,539 --> 01:35:32,268
discussion that ensues is does it

1869
01:35:29,179 --> 01:35:34,099
discover mud recover some of the

1870
01:35:32,269 --> 01:35:36,349
onboarding work that is go

1871
01:35:34,099 --> 01:35:38,510
related to mud like that's a lot of

1872
01:35:36,349 --> 01:35:40,610
stuff's going on in anima some of the

1873
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:43,670
stuff that's going on EMU there's

1874
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:45,409
discussion going on in acne around

1875
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:47,090
onboarding here which there's stuff

1876
01:35:45,409 --> 01:35:49,820
that's been going on in six dish which

1877
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:51,949
looks like it's about to close there's a

1878
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:54,170
whole animal architecture that's never

1879
01:35:51,949 --> 01:35:56,960
before or before it's not anima is the

1880
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:59,000
wrong word it's the 83 66 voucher work

1881
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,250
that Kent and others did which is being

1882
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,320
built upon and then we need to look at

1883
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:04,880
how that works an on-prem should we

1884
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,949
should we tie these into more of an

1885
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,540
onboarding working group or an IOT

1886
01:36:06,949 --> 01:36:10,940
onboarding working group or to the just

1887
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:13,630
be mud and I'm getting these this really

1888
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:16,339
ugly looking face from Warren so maybe

1889
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:18,560
maybe you want to comment more more than

1890
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:20,599
this guy I think we'll move on but I do

1891
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,050
think we should have this broader

1892
01:36:20,599 --> 01:36:27,409
discussion thank you Dan

1893
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:33,310
thank you our next presentation is also

1894
01:36:27,409 --> 01:36:33,309
remote how you can you hear us

1895
01:36:38,020 --> 01:37:00,679
how you song can you hear us yes okay we

1896
01:36:45,739 --> 01:37:08,839
hand and you are up if you're talking we

1897
01:37:00,679 --> 01:37:11,210
can no longer hear you talk about this

1898
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:14,329
in-situ flow information to lamprey

1899
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:20,960
framework we have been talking about

1900
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:23,299
this um in two meetings ago and then we

1901
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:27,590
also present this in AI ppm working

1902
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:31,239
group but we still think OBS aw geez a

1903
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:35,210
right feet for this document and

1904
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:37,329
therefore we are seeking for the working

1905
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:39,650
group adoption for this eventually

1906
01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:46,699
please go to the next slide

1907
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:48,110
uh so the motivation for this document

1908
01:37:46,699 --> 01:37:51,888
are threefold

1909
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:55,070
firstly there are currently some novel

1910
01:37:51,889 --> 01:37:59,270
data plane geometry technology are

1911
01:37:55,070 --> 01:38:02,360
emerging especially cuz they are we call

1912
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:05,530
that on past geometry it involves

1913
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:08,808
several are different technologies and

1914
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:12,440
we you think there is a need to actually

1915
01:38:08,809 --> 01:38:16,340
classify the terms and underlying

1916
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:18,919
techniques so that we can have a formal

1917
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:21,860
understanding about those different

1918
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:24,800
technologies and secondly as these

1919
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:28,610
techniques are very useful not only for

1920
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:31,190
the data center and the price Network we

1921
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:34,308
also see a strong interest from the

1922
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:38,119
carrier operators to apply these kind of

1923
01:38:34,309 --> 01:38:41,179
technologies however on you know tearing

1924
01:38:38,119 --> 01:38:44,179
or prototyping and deployment of this

1925
01:38:41,179 --> 01:38:47,150
technology we find there are quite a few

1926
01:38:44,179 --> 01:38:51,230
challenges we need to address before

1927
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:54,400
they can it can be a delayed providing

1928
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:59,650
in our networks so we also want to

1929
01:38:54,400 --> 01:39:03,909
provide an architectural framework to

1930
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:06,530
summarize the challenges and if some

1931
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:09,500
guideline for the future standard

1932
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:12,349
development so therefore it's also very

1933
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:17,059
important to continue to identify any

1934
01:39:12,349 --> 01:39:20,300
other issues and so it will be very

1935
01:39:17,059 --> 01:39:24,469
helpful for us to continue to develop

1936
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:29,989
collapse the suite of protocols next

1937
01:39:24,469 --> 01:39:34,280
slice yeah so in previous RFC's we have

1938
01:39:29,989 --> 01:39:37,790
a defined several distinct type of 4om

1939
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:42,739
techniques they are passive and active

1940
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:46,280
OAM the pensive means basically you just

1941
01:39:42,739 --> 01:39:49,669
a filter ER filter or sample user

1942
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:52,759
traffic and you stand to infer the form

1943
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:57,260
itself you use the traffic the active is

1944
01:39:52,760 --> 01:40:01,850
on the opposite side you the ural a you

1945
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:04,280
just inject some dedicated om package

1946
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:07,120
and you just mirrors those kind of

1947
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:11,030
active probing packets to get

1948
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:13,670
performance of the networks but they

1949
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:16,190
said you kind of on past data printed

1950
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:20,630
entry techniques are different from

1951
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:22,370
either passive mode or active mode so we

1952
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:27,350
think we can call that a hybrid mode

1953
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:29,840
because instead of just capture the user

1954
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:32,780
traffic or inject a new package it

1955
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:36,110
actively modified the user packet by

1956
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:39,019
adding metadata or instructions to the

1957
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:43,130
user packet and therefore collects those

1958
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:46,640
direct data from the user traffic to

1959
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:51,290
infer the performance of each user flows

1960
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:55,340
or the network and below this hybrid

1961
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:57,740
mode they can be further are separate to

1962
01:40:55,340 --> 01:41:00,740
two different type of underlying

1963
01:40:57,740 --> 01:41:03,590
techniques we call them a wise password

1964
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:06,559
mode and under its postcard mode bypass

1965
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:10,160
per mode means it's just basically are

1966
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:13,810
you stamp the new date to the user pack

1967
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:19,790
in the ante each each hop on the 40 pass

1968
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:21,950
so the representative technologies IOM

1969
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:26,120
trees mode and E to e mode the posts I

1970
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:30,410
belong to this category and in contrast

1971
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:33,890
the postcard mode is a different it's a

1972
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:35,950
instead of you know adding the user data

1973
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:40,340
to the packet itself it's just a

1974
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:45,559
directly exported data using a separate

1975
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:50,900
dedicated OM packet and the user traffic

1976
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:54,800
will be kept intact and or RSS or carry

1977
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:59,299
some instruction but note page a self so

1978
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:02,890
so we think a weekend in this document

1979
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:06,170
we can clarify this different type of

1980
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:09,350
technologies will be one contribution to

1981
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:13,210
our compliments you know that already

1982
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:15,729
defined terms for the OEM techniques

1983
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:20,090
next slide

1984
01:42:15,729 --> 01:42:24,800
um then this slide summarizes everal

1985
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:27,409
challenges we are we found when we

1986
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,869
trying to divide the technology scene

1987
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:33,170
carrier networks the first ones are

1988
01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:36,079
related to the performance because it

1989
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:39,199
this kind of techniques involve quite a

1990
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:41,808
lot they deplane are processing if

1991
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:44,419
you're generate data or generate export

1992
01:42:41,809 --> 01:42:47,360
package so sometimes it can have a

1993
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:52,099
direct impact on the folding performance

1994
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:55,880
we call an observant effect which would

1995
01:42:52,099 --> 01:42:59,989
call actually damage the fidelity of our

1996
01:42:55,880 --> 01:43:03,889
telemetry data and also you know I it's

1997
01:42:59,989 --> 01:43:06,440
not intolerable to actually impact the

1998
01:43:03,889 --> 01:43:09,469
folding performance and on the other

1999
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:12,440
hand as a as a export data due to that a

2000
01:43:09,469 --> 01:43:15,409
huge amount of I exported the data the

2001
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:18,169
benefits consumption is huge also those

2002
01:43:15,409 --> 01:43:21,348
data will may overload the processing

2003
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:23,719
servers will handle this kind of data so

2004
01:43:21,349 --> 01:43:27,440
this this a performance issues must be

2005
01:43:23,719 --> 01:43:30,650
addressed to allow this kind of tactics

2006
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:34,308
to be applied and also we find the

2007
01:43:30,650 --> 01:43:36,379
current design current standard

2008
01:43:34,309 --> 01:43:39,590
proposals there are limited data

2009
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:43,190
flexibility and extensibility which

2010
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:47,780
means it can be useful to add some

2011
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:50,209
predefined set of data but but I see

2012
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:52,880
there are to apply this in the wider

2013
01:43:50,209 --> 01:43:56,510
scope to support different Network

2014
01:43:52,880 --> 01:44:00,829
scenarios or to select different kind of

2015
01:43:56,510 --> 01:44:06,380
data source um even user data

2016
01:44:00,829 --> 01:44:07,130
that's this standard proposal still can

2017
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:10,369
o do that

2018
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:13,280
so we need to extend the flexibility and

2019
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:16,339
accessibility and the last one is a

2020
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:18,259
deployment issues because inherent

2021
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:22,280
networks there are so many different

2022
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:25,539
type of transport protocols and there

2023
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:26,679
are many related work going on in ITF to

2024
01:44:25,539 --> 01:44:30,780
to

2025
01:44:26,679 --> 01:44:33,519
talk about how you will encapsulate such

2026
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:37,179
protocol headers you address into the

2027
01:44:33,519 --> 01:44:39,639
different protocols so these are very

2028
01:44:37,179 --> 01:44:42,550
useful and we need to continue that kind

2029
01:44:39,639 --> 01:44:46,300
of work to try to cover a different kind

2030
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:49,269
of Network scenarios and also we to

2031
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:52,090
consider how to handle the different

2032
01:44:49,269 --> 01:44:56,349
tunnels how to make this work in both

2033
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:58,420
underline and underlay and overlay

2034
01:44:56,349 --> 01:45:01,329
networks so that's what we are very

2035
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:04,780
important clarified that the technique

2036
01:45:01,329 --> 01:45:09,579
how to write in tunnel mode next slide

2037
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:13,030
is okay so the the high level framework

2038
01:45:09,579 --> 01:45:15,969
I include four key components the first

2039
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:17,978
one i smart flow data selection which

2040
01:45:15,969 --> 01:45:22,510
works and the basically has had a node

2041
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:24,820
it allow to us to define what kind of

2042
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:27,099
packets or what can flow we should

2043
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:29,739
actually enable this kind of data

2044
01:45:27,099 --> 01:45:31,929
collection technique right then there

2045
01:45:29,739 --> 01:45:36,188
there can be a different algorithm based

2046
01:45:31,929 --> 01:45:39,369
approaches and or some user-defined

2047
01:45:36,189 --> 01:45:42,189
smart filters of this kind of techniques

2048
01:45:39,369 --> 01:45:44,829
are very useful if you reduce as a load

2049
01:45:42,189 --> 01:45:49,829
to the network and the second component

2050
01:45:44,829 --> 01:45:53,340
is explored data reduction which means

2051
01:45:49,829 --> 01:45:59,170
when and every node if it ever need to

2052
01:45:53,340 --> 01:46:01,719
export data and we can deploy some event

2053
01:45:59,170 --> 01:46:04,150
based smart filters to actually reduce

2054
01:46:01,719 --> 01:46:07,959
amount of data that need to be exported

2055
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:11,768
so that's a very effective to to reduce

2056
01:46:07,959 --> 01:46:14,289
theta X bandwidth also reduces load of

2057
01:46:11,769 --> 01:46:16,570
the processing server and third

2058
01:46:14,289 --> 01:46:19,630
components as covers are the

2059
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:22,659
encapsulation and the tunnel mode issues

2060
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:26,349
so make it workable in different

2061
01:46:22,659 --> 01:46:28,030
underlying networks so the last one is

2062
01:46:26,349 --> 01:46:30,939
that dynamic and natural probe is

2063
01:46:28,030 --> 01:46:32,920
actually a very key components can be

2064
01:46:30,939 --> 01:46:36,900
used to support the previous three

2065
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:39,750
components by you know allow user to

2066
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:42,830
device data

2067
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:44,310
filtering out intersection policies

2068
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:47,790
underground hi

2069
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:50,550
so with this of core components we came

2070
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:53,100
a support we can address the performance

2071
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:56,630
the prior ability and the flexibility

2072
01:46:53,100 --> 01:47:01,830
issues we are facing in Korea networks

2073
01:46:56,630 --> 01:47:04,950
next slice yeah so basically you want to

2074
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:07,470
take this opportunity to have a more

2075
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:09,960
discussion with a working group and we

2076
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:14,730
want to collect more feedbacks from

2077
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:16,860
working group so apart from those have

2078
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:20,490
been covered in this document we want to

2079
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:22,080
know are there any other challenges or

2080
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:28,200
the carrier networks data printing I'm

2081
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:31,080
free we need to address and also what

2082
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:33,840
was missing in this is document is there

2083
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:38,100
any suggestions to accept framework more

2084
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:41,910
complete and we yeah we welcome any

2085
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:44,490
feedback on this draft and so we can

2086
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:48,150
like help us to improve this document

2087
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:49,920
and we move it towards the call for the

2088
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:53,059
working group adoption

2089
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:55,230
thank you very much any question so

2090
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:57,240
thank you

2091
01:47:55,230 --> 01:48:00,929
take one question then we have to take

2092
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:02,790
the rest of the list Shwetha cisco I've

2093
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:05,160
gone through this draft a few times it

2094
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:08,160
looks more like a white paper describing

2095
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:10,950
a solution less like a framework it's a

2096
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:12,540
bit confusing on how who is targeted

2097
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:14,750
towards and how to how to use it

2098
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:16,710
including the the challenges

2099
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:19,740
requirements that the framework is going

2100
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:22,530
to meet and it has a bunch of references

2101
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:24,570
to to a whole lot of individual work

2102
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:27,750
which I'm which are neither RFC's or

2103
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:29,940
have been adopted it it looks more like

2104
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:31,860
the data that is collected here which is

2105
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:33,719
useful could be could be given as

2106
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:36,480
feedback to the existing drafts that are

2107
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:38,700
under work elsewhere and and then

2108
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:42,959
revisit and see how do you how do you

2109
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:45,840
want to proceed with giving a operator

2110
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:48,780
feedback on how to use those inbound

2111
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:51,720
telemetry protocols that are going to be

2112
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:53,429
defined and some implementation guidance

2113
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:57,630
but as a frame

2114
01:48:53,429 --> 01:49:00,030
it doesn't make much sense to me yes so

2115
01:48:57,630 --> 01:49:05,370
the technique coward here that quite new

2116
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:09,300
via or RFC draft ITF drops right now and

2117
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:12,360
so this this document doesn't introduce

2118
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:17,219
any new techniques it's a means to be an

2119
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:19,320
informational and also we want to

2120
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:23,540
collect actually the feedback from

2121
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:26,670
operators for their experience all

2122
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:29,219
departments for the deployment so we

2123
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:33,449
also want to provide best you know

2124
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:37,230
industry practice so that we can help in

2125
01:49:33,449 --> 01:49:42,210
our IDF to to continue work on this

2126
01:49:37,230 --> 01:49:47,120
related to the technique so I think

2127
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:47,120
that's a main purpose of this draft

2128
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:51,989
documenting in deployment experience

2129
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:55,610
would be useful but that's not in there

2130
01:49:51,989 --> 01:49:57,678
yet and and there is reference to

2131
01:49:55,610 --> 01:50:02,309
algorithms that would make it better

2132
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:03,600
there is reference to unbox processing

2133
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:06,719
that would make it better without any

2134
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:09,590
concrete examples I think those adding

2135
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:13,980
those what would make it useful thanks

2136
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:15,420
but yeah please bring that up on the

2137
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:18,030
list so we can capture some of that that

2138
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:20,219
was a contributor some of my feedback as

2139
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:22,349
well let's see we can push that out

2140
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:27,870
there and how you thank you again for

2141
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:36,120
presenting our last presenter is remote

2142
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:46,219
Mickey can you hear us Mickey are you

2143
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:46,219
there Mikey sorry he's coming to the mic

2144
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:54,080
can you hear me now we can okay all you

2145
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:55,970
the

2146
01:50:54,080 --> 01:51:00,890
the quicker you can go through this the

2147
01:50:55,970 --> 01:51:04,310
better okay so I wanted to talk about

2148
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:08,180
IOM raw data export so first for those

2149
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:11,600
who are not that aware I Oh AMR is in

2150
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:13,640
situ OEM is being progressed in the AI

2151
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:19,970
ppm working group where there's a draft

2152
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:22,070
for a data plane format that would go

2153
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:25,400
into packets so essentially if packets

2154
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:28,519
traversing a network in the in a domain

2155
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:30,500
and maybe at when the packets come into

2156
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:34,400
the domain you start adding at every hop

2157
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:35,600
some network telemetry information and

2158
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,870
then when you get to the other end you

2159
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:40,520
need to export that in some way amount

2160
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:43,280
to a processing system that can do

2161
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:45,800
analytics or whatever type of monitoring

2162
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:48,620
you want so this kind of complements all

2163
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:50,780
that it's not about how you affect the

2164
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:53,950
normal data plane packets but now that

2165
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:56,599
you've collected a bunch of information

2166
01:51:53,950 --> 01:52:00,220
how can we export that and what would we

2167
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:00,220
do with that next slide please

2168
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:10,040
so so as I mentioned IOM records

2169
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:12,260
operational and telemetry information in

2170
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:15,410
its initial form in the packet itself

2171
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:18,140
though there are proposals to export

2172
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:22,280
directly from nodes as well so in raw

2173
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:24,050
export we're really saying that for a

2174
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:26,450
lot of the hardware switches and routers

2175
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:29,600
out there they want to focus primarily

2176
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:31,790
on forwarding and you know just getting

2177
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,320
the data to its endpoint it's very

2178
01:52:31,790 --> 01:52:35,990
useful to collect this telemetry

2179
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:39,280
information and that's what's new about

2180
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:41,690
IO am but we'd like to minimize the

2181
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:44,300
processing load and the difficulty of

2182
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:48,440
doing that within those nodes and one

2183
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:50,720
way to do that is to do what we call raw

2184
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:53,360
export which is kind of a minimal form

2185
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:56,390
of where you do as little processing is

2186
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:58,190
necessary to retrieve that IO am data

2187
01:52:56,390 --> 01:53:01,310
that's been collected and then export

2188
01:52:58,190 --> 01:53:03,160
that in the simplest manner possible so

2189
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:06,050
as you see in the figure on the right

2190
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:07,050
the IO am node is a switch or router

2191
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:10,050
that is

2192
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:14,130
forwarding packets you do that the raw

2193
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:17,909
export is in allowing to offload a lot

2194
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:20,909
of the processing or aggregation or

2195
01:53:17,909 --> 01:53:22,500
reformatting to an IOM data processing

2196
01:53:20,909 --> 01:53:25,558
system so we're just trying to get the

2197
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:28,559
information off the IOM notice as simply

2198
01:53:25,559 --> 01:53:30,300
as possible and then from that it is

2199
01:53:28,559 --> 01:53:32,520
possible that after that I um data

2200
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:34,679
processing system it may do some

2201
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:38,639
formatting or aggregation or processing

2202
01:53:34,679 --> 01:53:41,010
it may do some interpretation and from

2203
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:43,290
there you may have something else it's

2204
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:46,500
gonna progress that to a monitoring or

2205
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:48,809
analytic system so this is really

2206
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:51,030
focused on that first light blue arrow

2207
01:53:48,809 --> 01:53:53,280
on the bottom for a rocks for dividing

2208
01:53:51,030 --> 01:53:55,290
data it is not focused on the processed

2209
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:58,019
or interpreted or aggregated iom data

2210
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:59,699
which is something that could be

2211
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:03,000
addressed that might be valuable but

2212
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:07,730
that's not what this draft is is trying

2213
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,730
to do next slide please

2214
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:13,829
so as we look at raw export we really

2215
01:54:11,699 --> 01:54:16,619
want to get just the the telemetry

2216
01:54:13,829 --> 01:54:19,170
information and some packet fields as

2217
01:54:16,619 --> 01:54:22,409
well so we want to be able to identify

2218
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:24,000
the packet or the flow and for that we

2219
01:54:22,409 --> 01:54:26,269
just we're basically saying if you just

2220
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,650
take a chunk of the packet itself

2221
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:33,659
involving a bunch of the headers then

2222
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:35,969
you can figure out what the packet is so

2223
01:54:33,659 --> 01:54:41,119
as we looked at how we could do this we

2224
01:54:35,969 --> 01:54:41,119
found that IP fix is a possible answer

2225
01:54:41,239 --> 01:54:46,589
IP fix is a generic export protocol so

2226
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:50,429
while initially it was primarily used

2227
01:54:46,590 --> 01:54:53,550
for counters and meters and things like

2228
01:54:50,429 --> 01:54:56,639
that um there was a packet sampling

2229
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:58,679
framework to find and that exports

2230
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:00,630
chunks of packets and we found that that

2231
01:54:58,679 --> 01:55:03,480
is a pretty good match for what we want

2232
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:06,869
to do and IP fix has these templates

2233
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:13,829
that allow you to construct fairly

2234
01:55:06,869 --> 01:55:16,589
concise packet formats or formats for

2235
01:55:13,829 --> 01:55:19,530
the exported packets where you can add

2236
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:20,639
various fields that can help provide

2237
01:55:19,530 --> 01:55:23,820
contacts

2238
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:27,300
and could include the IOM headers

2239
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:30,210
themselves now because we want to

2240
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:32,460
support this you know billions of

2241
01:55:30,210 --> 01:55:36,929
packets per second kind of crazy line

2242
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:39,210
rates it's likely that an implementation

2243
01:55:36,929 --> 01:55:41,070
that's using IP fix for export of IO

2244
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:43,739
a.m. is going to do a small subset of

2245
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:46,710
what IP fix normally does so we're not

2246
01:55:43,739 --> 01:55:49,138
talking at generic you know to find any

2247
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:51,679
template you want and go off and run

2248
01:55:49,139 --> 01:55:54,840
with it we're we're talking about

2249
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:57,900
supporting a small number of all of

2250
01:55:54,840 --> 01:56:00,869
templates that are rather fixed and but

2251
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:03,449
a template can then describe whoever's

2252
01:56:00,869 --> 01:56:05,639
receiving this what that format is and

2253
01:56:03,449 --> 01:56:08,820
it allows a fair amount of flexibility

2254
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:12,750
then different implementations could use

2255
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:15,000
different IP fixed templates which

2256
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:18,150
allowed them to optimize and support it

2257
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:20,219
well in hardware and systems receiving

2258
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:22,769
them would do the more flexible the full

2259
01:56:20,219 --> 01:56:26,520
IP fix implementation and they could

2260
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:30,090
interpret it with various formats coming

2261
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:32,510
say from different vendors or so on next

2262
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:32,510
slide please

2263
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:39,449
so there's a bunch of information

2264
01:56:36,989 --> 01:56:41,879
elements that are already defined for

2265
01:56:39,449 --> 01:56:44,580
packet sampling so section of an IP

2266
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:47,810
header or a section of a data link frame

2267
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:52,100
or Ethernet so some of those have been

2268
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:52,100
identified here next slide please

2269
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:58,260
so we're also proposing some new

2270
01:56:55,619 --> 01:57:00,000
information elements to provide a

2271
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:01,619
district more context or tell you

2272
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,960
something about the IOM encapsulation

2273
01:57:01,619 --> 01:57:06,299
type before on the bottom are the actual

2274
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:08,489
IOM information so you just take that

2275
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:12,230
chunk that's already defined in the I

2276
01:57:08,489 --> 01:57:13,949
ppm drafts and just throw it in one in

2277
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:18,769
information element that you then

2278
01:57:13,949 --> 01:57:18,769
include an IP fix next slide please

2279
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:24,290
and then there are some

2280
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:26,090
examples you don't have to follow these

2281
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:28,190
formats but these are examples of how

2282
01:57:26,090 --> 01:57:30,080
you might do things so you might just

2283
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:35,360
have an IP header packet section with

2284
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:37,940
the IOM embedded within next slide or

2285
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:40,309
you could include the hour in front in

2286
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:41,750
this example you have the IOM data and

2287
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:43,820
then a few other fields and then the

2288
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:51,290
packet section so you know which packet

2289
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:53,330
or flow it is next slide also we found

2290
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:55,159
some issues with alignment so like for

2291
01:57:53,330 --> 01:57:57,290
byte alignment is a big issue for a lot

2292
01:57:55,159 --> 01:57:59,330
of hardware implementations and when you

2293
01:57:57,290 --> 01:58:03,429
have multiple implement a multiple

2294
01:57:59,330 --> 01:58:08,780
information elements with the existing

2295
01:58:03,429 --> 01:58:11,119
IP packet section if you have multiple

2296
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:14,059
information once it doesn't necessarily

2297
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:27,619
always format alignment so propose two

2298
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:29,659
things to next let's go to them so so

2299
01:58:27,619 --> 01:58:32,570
this has been presented an IP PM before

2300
01:58:29,659 --> 01:58:34,369
and the question is as we look at these

2301
01:58:32,570 --> 01:58:38,299
issues and try to define this and

2302
01:58:34,369 --> 01:58:42,710
progress this does this topic make more

2303
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:45,110
sense in ops AWG or an IP PM there's no

2304
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:51,020
real home for IP fix at the moment I

2305
01:58:45,110 --> 01:58:53,089
believe so we're really asking if ops

2306
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:55,820
AWG will be interested in progressing

2307
01:58:53,090 --> 01:58:58,369
this work and soliciting technical input

2308
01:58:55,820 --> 01:59:03,530
and feedback how many people have read

2309
01:58:58,369 --> 01:59:05,690
this draft only three hands and two of

2310
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:09,259
them are ad hoc a few more hands have

2311
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:12,110
gone up is their interests in in doing

2312
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:18,760
this work in ops AWG this perfect

2313
01:59:12,110 --> 01:59:18,759
workaround IP fix and IO am and we're

2314
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:26,330
okay I think we'll take that to the list

2315
01:59:23,449 --> 01:59:28,699
and ask that question there Mickey thank

2316
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:30,889
you very much we are well out of prime

2317
01:59:28,699 --> 01:59:32,750
so please do read this all of these

2318
01:59:30,889 --> 01:59:36,019
drafts and come to the list and comment

2319
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:39,489
and with that in the last 30 seconds

2320
01:59:36,019 --> 01:59:45,050
I'm handing things over to ops area for

2321
01:59:39,489 --> 01:59:48,919
our 80s before we before we switch so I

2322
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:51,230
fix has home in ops AWG as basically a

2323
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:53,239
catch-all there another option is that

2324
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:56,089
this might be an individual response of

2325
01:59:53,239 --> 02:00:05,030
document here for that's only of this

2326
01:59:56,090 --> 02:00:08,539
single single piece of work Warren

2327
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:10,249
Kumari also commenting on that so I

2328
02:00:08,539 --> 02:00:13,880
guess the big question is where do you

2329
02:00:10,249 --> 02:00:15,260
think ever get more review so far it

2330
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:16,849
hasn't got a huge amount of discussion

2331
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:19,210
and updated eg if you think it'll get

2332
02:00:16,849 --> 02:00:32,480
more review a night ppm and there's fine

2333
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:35,349
one if you want Thank You Mickey are

2334
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:45,558
there any questions for the ops area

2335
02:00:35,349 --> 02:00:47,360
directors open mic with that then unless

2336
02:00:45,559 --> 02:00:55,280
Ignace sir Warren you want to say any

2337
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:58,518
closing remarks so one of the topics

2338
02:00:55,280 --> 02:01:00,920
that was raised previously about modern

2339
02:00:58,519 --> 02:01:05,719
related work and where the home for that

2340
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:07,969
would be and also similar activities in

2341
02:01:05,719 --> 02:01:10,269
anima possibly in security related

2342
02:01:07,969 --> 02:01:13,280
working groups

2343
02:01:10,269 --> 02:01:16,039
does the audience think that they would

2344
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:18,949
like to discuss this Elliott wanted but

2345
02:01:16,039 --> 02:01:24,440
he had to leave so anyone else

2346
02:01:18,949 --> 02:01:29,388
interested in this topic right any

2347
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:31,579
comments about that so mud the core of

2348
02:01:29,389 --> 02:01:33,980
the mud workers seems to be done now

2349
02:01:31,579 --> 02:01:36,230
there are extensions similar thing is

2350
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:38,570
happening with brewski Bruce key is

2351
02:01:36,230 --> 02:01:40,579
being processed but the rest now

2352
02:01:38,570 --> 02:01:42,409
incoming work on what was called brewski

2353
02:01:40,579 --> 02:01:47,659
profiles extensions uses and other

2354
02:01:42,409 --> 02:01:50,989
things onboarding in general is

2355
02:01:47,659 --> 02:01:54,638
topic of interest for the community the

2356
02:01:50,989 --> 02:01:59,839
question is how large is that community

2357
02:01:54,639 --> 02:02:01,489
do we need the central kind of a group

2358
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:03,980
or them for the lack of a better word

2359
02:02:01,489 --> 02:02:07,400
which would coordinate at work or can

2360
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:10,459
that work be done fragmented lis in in

2361
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:21,138
different places where that is now so

2362
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:24,080
your thoughts I think from matter work

2363
02:02:21,139 --> 02:02:27,739
actually agree there's a lot of relevant

2364
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:30,170
really to use T device management it

2365
02:02:27,739 --> 02:02:32,870
would be good to have a single place to

2366
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:35,719
talk about this and I also am having

2367
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:37,460
what know where there's a home gateway

2368
02:02:35,719 --> 02:02:41,000
home networking group I'm not sure

2369
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:44,630
what's the ask over so since the for

2370
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:48,050
this matter will cover a lot of the you

2371
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:51,320
know security partner onboarding Brisky

2372
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:54,469
acacia is very complicated I cannot have

2373
02:02:51,320 --> 02:03:00,049
the Hopi show so and want to better

2374
02:02:54,469 --> 02:03:04,489
understand the scope is matter work for

2375
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:06,170
me Joe Clark similar I I don't mind the

2376
02:03:04,489 --> 02:03:07,610
the mud work happening in ops area

2377
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:10,610
working group as a working group chair

2378
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:14,719
but it sounds like and there is a lot of

2379
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:16,099
side meetings other aliases other areas

2380
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:19,190
where there's interest it might make

2381
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:23,900
sense to centralize that to give that

2382
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:26,980
community a more focused ability to

2383
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:26,980
progress this work

2384
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:34,609
[Music]

2385
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:47,350
yeah I would direct your attention to

2386
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:50,020
the comment on the chat from Dar Shaq

2387
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:51,640
the core who says I believe there's a

2388
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:55,030
lot of interest in onboarding and yes a

2389
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:59,520
single place or group would be nice home

2390
02:03:55,030 --> 02:04:02,110
net is probably the wrong place so my

2391
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:07,060
yeah I mean I think you can interpret

2392
02:04:02,110 --> 02:04:08,830
that how you want to thanks thanks for

2393
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:12,940
laying the question that I would have

2394
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:14,260
from my side is having work spread in

2395
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:17,080
different places in grouped by topic

2396
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:21,969
probably results in the fast work on

2397
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:23,410
those components if this becomes so if

2398
02:04:21,969 --> 02:04:25,630
for example a new working group is

2399
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:31,989
established to kind of coordinate all of

2400
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:34,060
that work wouldn't that result in a long

2401
02:04:31,989 --> 02:04:36,549
but probably needed discussion on how to

2402
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:39,820
organize that on framework documents on

2403
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:46,739
on kind of guidance and less focus on

2404
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:46,739
actual shipping products specifications

2405
02:04:48,330 --> 02:05:03,430
is that is that of a concern for the

2406
02:04:51,699 --> 02:05:07,080
community yeah actually for this out he

2407
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:09,730
really Walker I want to see more out he

2408
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:12,699
in their own manager Acadia more likely

2409
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:18,669
so it's a something we should sing about

2410
02:05:12,699 --> 02:05:20,710
that yes definitely but not less so one

2411
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:22,960
experiment one thing we did in ops

2412
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:25,090
Regina pass is that whenever we saw that

2413
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:28,960
we had like three or four documents

2414
02:05:25,090 --> 02:05:32,190
energy management then a new charter was

2415
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:34,960
created by the ad to just create that

2416
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:37,509
that charter now to come back to your

2417
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,699
question I'm only going to go through

2418
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:42,100
the series of requirements and framework

2419
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:44,290
and everything it just depends what the

2420
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:46,210
ATS will put in a charter right and I

2421
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:47,890
think lately there was like an IG

2422
02:05:46,210 --> 02:05:50,679
statement telling that we don't have to

2423
02:05:47,890 --> 02:05:53,320
go through in sequence requirements and

2424
02:05:50,679 --> 02:05:54,460
frameworks and cetera so you could just

2425
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:56,349
target and say

2426
02:05:54,460 --> 02:06:00,550
this is what this group is supposed to

2427
02:05:56,350 --> 02:06:03,130
do so this is your choice would probably

2428
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:06,070
this would not disagree with that but

2429
02:06:03,130 --> 02:06:08,320
that's up to the working group actually

2430
02:06:06,070 --> 02:06:10,540
trying to adhere to that and doing

2431
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:14,230
something and well we have a really good

2432
02:06:10,540 --> 02:06:17,560
history of over thinking about the

2433
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:19,570
problem space not necessary for bad

2434
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:21,910
reasons but that takes a really long

2435
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:24,730
time so the question is if for example

2436
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:27,099
there are only extensions in a pipeline

2437
02:06:24,730 --> 02:06:30,009
for mud maybe it's more efficient to do

2438
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:31,630
that here concentrated on on mud if

2439
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:33,400
there are extensions to brewski maybe

2440
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:39,490
it's more efficient to concentrate an

2441
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:41,280
anima to address those extensions if we

2442

coverage from architectural point of

2444

view yes that's probably a new working

2445
02:06:45,850 --> 02:06:50,740
group and maybe maybe even more but the

2446
