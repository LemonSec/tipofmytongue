[Music]

5
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,980
Hey

6
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:05,010
yeah okay good all right so who you get

7
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,010
started here

8
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,090
so this this is the IRT F open meeting

9
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,440
if someone at the back could could pull

10
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,040
the doors in please that would be

11
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,040
appreciated

12
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,150
all right so thank you welcome everybody

13
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:38,190
this is the IRT F open meeting my name

14
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:42,900
is Colin Perkins I'm the IRT F chair we

15
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,790
have a bunch of things today quick

16
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,000
introduction and status updates get us

17
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,940
started and we have a short update from

18
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,340
the information centric networking

19
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,370
Research Group talking about the CC n XR

20
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:00,270
FCS and then we'll spend the majority of

21
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,550
the time today with two really excellent

22
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:06,030
talks from the applied networking

23
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,400
research price with Metro Rosen Schiff

24
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:13,640
sitting in the front here to start with

25
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:17,520
talking about MTP and new NTP client

26
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,440
called Chronos and TJ Chung at the end

27
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,990
talking about the role of registrar's in

28
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,790
DNS SEC opponent really nice

29
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:30,930
measurements let me back it's a lot of

30
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,530
echo good closer or further loosely is

31
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,710
this better

32
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,419
yes okay excellent all right it's it's

33
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,090
even more echoey from where I'm sitting

34
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,010
but if it's better for you that's good

35
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:45,780
okay so this is the IRT F open meeting

36
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:48,810
the IRT F as a reminder is a parallel

37
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:53,369
organization to the IETF which focuses

38
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,990
on the longer-term research issues we

39
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,820
got a bunch of mailing lists which you

40
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,530
may consider joining we've got an

41
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,760
announcements list which is pretty low

42
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:04,950
volume and a discussion list only of the

43
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,969
the IETF that org website which has all

44
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:11,460
the information about the organization

45
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,490
we do three types of things in the IRT F

46
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,010
we've got a bunch of research groups of

47
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,210
which there are 11 full research groups

48
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:23,400
and three proposed research groups we

49
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,159
cover a pretty full range of the

50
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,349
possible subjects from the crypto forum

51
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,630
group all the way through to quantum

52
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,550
Internet network measurements

53
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,570
information centric networking Human

54
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,220
Rights global access and so on the

55
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,770
groups in dark green

56
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,820
full research groups the ones in light

57
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,680
green and gray proposed research groups

58
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,570
we let new research groups run for a

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,880
year and see if that things are working

60
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,880
and if so they don't get charted as a

61
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,210
full research group the coin group had

62
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,540
its first meeting in Prague competition

63
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,789
in the network group looked being some

64
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,390
really nice stuff I'm in network

65
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:11,140
computing the privacy enhancements group

66
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:13,150
will be having their third meeting later

67
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,060
this week and expect their transition to

68
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,859
a full research group shortly after that

69
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,710
and the quantum internet group who had

70
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,200
not meeting this time had a really nice

71
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,870
tutorial in Prague which I understood

72
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:31,180
not a word of about quantum quantum

73
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:33,760
Internet and the quantum physics but the

74
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,460
physics behind what it needs to build a

75
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,320
quantum link and look to be doing some

76
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,880
really nice work that they're

77
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,620
alternating their meetings between here

78
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,130
and quantum physics conferences so

79
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,630
they're not meeting this time we also

80
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,909
have the applied networking research

81
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,040
workshop which run yesterday

82
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,910
we had a couple hundred people in

83
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,760
attendance a bunch of really nice papers

84
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:01,090
this is a conference we organized in

85
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,890
conjunction with ACM sitcom proceedings

86
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,469
are published in the ACM digital library

87
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,000
it's a peer reviewed or workshop we got

88
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,270
some really nice papers which are all on

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,370
the website and we hope to do this all

90
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,719
again next year still a little bit

91
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,270
provisional but hopefully this will be

92
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,250
running again and that summer ITF in

93
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,109
Madrid next year so look out for the

94
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:24,820
call for papers around Christmas time

95
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:27,580
just after and finally we have the

96
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:31,090
applied networking research prize which

97
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,620
is awarded for some results in recent

98
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,838
results in applied networking research

99
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,549
and we'll have the two talks which

100
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,150
comprise the majority of this session

101
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:42,549
talking about MTP security and checking

102
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:46,120
out DNS SEC deployment there'll be a

103
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,040
couple more NRP talks at ITF 106 in

104
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,650
Singapore and we'll be opening

105
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,740
nominations for the 2020 awards and come

106
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,020
October November time so if you've read

107
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,010
any good applied networking research

108
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,689
papers keeping them in mind we'd

109
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:08,319
appreciate you nominations later in the

110
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:12,230
year okay so that's all I have to say

111
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:15,830
before we move on to the ANR paper talks

112
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:38,839
we just have a short talk you can find

113
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:40,970
it on cc NX thank you so my name is

114
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,010
Wallace blowing about my name is Mark

115
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,279
Moscow I'm the principal author on the

116
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:51,189
two experimental aspects that just got

117
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:51,189
released for CCMS from the ICN RG

118
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,240
okay there we go so the there were two

119
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,540
documents released as part of this

120
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,180
protocol the versus 85 69 the semantics

121
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,829
document which describes the behavior

122
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,560
and the meaning of the different fields

123
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:32,510
and then there's an encoding document 80

124
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:37,160
609 which uses a mostly TLV format to

125
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:39,830
encode the protocol messages so for

126
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,079
those of you who don't know CC NX is one

127
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,649
of the IC energy information centric

128
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,630
networking protocols and the idea here

129
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,240
is that you do something to name the

130
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,149
data that you're requesting and you can

131
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,060
use that name in fetching the data so

132
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,580
you're not doing quite the host a host

133
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:02,630
networking you're trying to get

134
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:06,529
something by its content and this was

135
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:09,279
first proposed in 2009 and went under a

136
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:12,860
significant revision beginning in 2014

137
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:17,200
the first drafts I think were submitted

138
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:22,310
in 2016 so it's been kind of a long

139
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,350
march for these specifications and just

140
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:28,189
to give you one of the high level use

141
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,529
cases it's an interest and response to

142
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,470
the request response protocol so I can

143
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,300
ask for some name like example.com slash

144
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,110
photo dot manifests and I can specify

145
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,849
the key that the publisher used to

146
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,430
publish this and the network can ensure

147
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,430
that I get three that the I get the data

148
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,430
that I asked for and then we can do

149
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:52,010
tricks with how to fetch data by hash

150
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:57,760
based naming once you have a manifest

151
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:59,930
for that data there are four principal

152
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,439
implementations that are going right now

153
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:06,170
one is called community ICN and this is

154
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,170
a Linux Foundation work and this is

155
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,250
meant to be a fairly high speed

156
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:14,479
implementation of uses of dr. packet

157
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,579
packet processing CCN blight which is a

158
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,200
widely used implementation especially on

159
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:24,660
smaller platforms and C for this is from

160
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,180
the National Research Institute of Japan

161
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,370
and this has also simulator emulator

162
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:35,209
modules available for it so all of these

163
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:40,560
are based on the CC NX RFC's hybrid ICN

164
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:43,880
who looks at integrating name based name

165
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,209
based routing into the ipv6 address

166
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:52,350
space so between the ipv6 address and

167
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:55,109
the transport address it's kind of fully

168
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,720
integrates so it's not really an overlay

169
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,420
it's an integration thank you very much

170
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,770
ok thank you

171
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:05,219
maybe after Central what one quick

172
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,839
question if anyone has one it's a nice

173
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,120
nice piece of work just finishing up

174
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,200
from the NCN group thank you okay thank

175
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,200
you that's a

176
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,280
okay so the first of the two applied

177
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,460
networking research prize-winning talks

178
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,870
is meta Rosen shift from the Hebrew

179
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,640
University in Jerusalem who'll be

180
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:12,030
talking about preventing network time

181
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:14,370
travel with us hi I'm and today I'm

182
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,550
going to present a walk on our to and

183
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,000
protect NTP with the host is a joint

184
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:25,260
work with Omega H they need to live and

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,420
appear so anti B Network and protocol it

186
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,069
is used to a synchronous time across

187
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,430
computer over the Internet

188
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,620
I guess you all know I'm how make sure

189
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:38,280
is money application will be learning

190
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:43,670
such as TLS dinners HTTP cables and many

191
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:46,199
financial applications and in a nutshell

192
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,300
NTP is a client-server architecture

193
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,580
consists of two main processes both

194
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,099
process and selection process so for

195
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:57,330
example if we have we have one client

196
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:01,260
that in the process and ntp queries two

197
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:03,990
three entity servers get an NTP

198
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,090
responses from the NTP servers and then

199
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,510
in the selection process the best time

200
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:13,860
samples are selected and used in order

201
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:15,720
to update the clifftop however NTP is

202
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,310
highly vulnerable to time shifting

203
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,700
attacks especially made by

204
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,890
man-in-the-middle attack here who and

205
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,250
who have a control over this section

206
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:32,850
between client and one of the entity

207
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:35,580
service and for example let's assume

208
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,960
without loss of generality that name the

209
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,300
man in the middle control the section

210
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,050
between the client and the left and

211
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:46,020
Bishop and man in the middle attack in

212
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,719
CHEM temper NTP responses he can impact

213
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,670
the local clock of the client by simply

214
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,290
dropping on delight in packets that is

215
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,110
why encryption and authentication are

216
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:58,140
insufficient here and he can make the

217
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,870
time believed that his sample is the

218
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,640
best one and he should follow previous

219
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,630
studies even consider man

220
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,970
middle is too strong quantity but why is

221
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,760
an NTP so vulnerable to you men and even

222
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,560
old anyway as we said before and being

223
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,180
consists of two main processes both

224
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,589
process and selection process in the

225
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:22,349
process then P relies on a very small

226
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,450
set of service and they're often in a

227
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,630
sketched which means that the attacker

228
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:30,330
only needs management capabilities with

229
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:33,870
respect of few and to be server in order

230
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,460
to maintain his TUC over time and the

231
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,770
entity selection process algorithms

232
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,380
assume that in currency are rare and

233
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,230
they're well distributed around a you

234
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,420
see the correct time that is why

235
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,720
powerful and sophisticated man in the

236
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,540
middle attack again can bypass this

237
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:55,140
algorithm and he's the young scope of

238
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,579
traditional and sweet women's in order

239
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:01,980
to face these limitations and we suggest

240
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:05,819
modification fight and the client called

241
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:08,130
homes it has the following

242
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,560
characteristics it has provable security

243
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,690
we can bound the probability of

244
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,708
successful time shifting attacks even

245
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:18,240
made by men in the military we can make

246
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,010
what come ability since there is no need

247
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,470
to change anything in the server side

248
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,440
only small and limiters are needed in

249
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,480
this in the client side and we add only

250
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,450
low computational and communication on

251
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,990
overhead since eventually very only few

252
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:36,660
NTP servers so in order to prove that

253
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,730
harness actually protect NTP we need to

254
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,500
define our treat model so we assume that

255
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,750
the attacker I have fully control of a

256
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,970
large function of the NTP service sake

257
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,760
Porter we also assume that he is capable

258
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,160
of both modifying the content of the NTP

259
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,129
response and the timing when it's going

260
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,690
to arrive to define and finally we

261
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,970
assume that these malicious and try to

262
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,190
shift the client stop as much as

263
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,260
possible

264
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,690
so how Collins is built on the one hand

265
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,790
we rely on many and to be server we it

266
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,280
servers and we generate a large

267
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,770
several hundred of service per client

268
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,440
and in order to raise the trishul needed

269
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,270
by the attacker to attack on the other

270
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,309
hand require only few servers

271
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,570
the chances of them are choosing at

272
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:23,678
random in order to avoid MVP and

273
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,750
overloading and the peak server side of

274
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,120
the world and finally we use smart

275
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,670
filter in order to remove outliers and

276
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:36,309
make it hard to then many demands occur

277
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:39,070
to contaminate the chosen samples so now

278
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:42,399
out of that and the pool I am informally

279
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:45,520
going to describe how we update our

280
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,370
clock so out of hundred of servers in a

281
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,450
cool we choose tenth of them at random

282
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:55,989
then we ordered them from low to high we

283
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,570
remove the D lowest and the highest time

284
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:04,059
samples and take a look at the remaining

285
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:04,928
sets and then we ask two questions we

286
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,540
have two conditions

287
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:08,890
the first one is rather their samples in

288
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,010
the remaining set are close to each

289
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:14,200
other and the other condition is whether

290
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,990
their average is close to the clients

291
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:21,460
clock if both of these conditions are

292
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:25,590
satisfied them we use the average of the

293
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,590
remaining sets as their new clients cook

294
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:31,590
otherwise we were sample and again out

295
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,570
of hundreds of servers tenants are

296
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,030
choosing tronic chosen at random and

297
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,669
which work this from each side could be

298
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,940
for example third and we take a look

299
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:45,100
there were many certain stand and test

300
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,900
the two conditions whether they're close

301
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,300
to each other and whether they're and

302
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,270
every range it goes today and clients

303
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,639
look if you fail try again and again

304
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,670
again and again until we fail k times

305
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,020
and then we move to the panic one where

306
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:05,760
we sample all the server's dropped D for

307
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:10,480
example one third from each side and

308
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,870
take the new time of the client as the

309
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,870
average

310
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,480
so first I'm going to present our

311
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,180
security guarantees and now I will

312
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,770
describe our security analysis so

313
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,350
essentially what we are showing in our

314
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:30,379
paper is that shifting time actually

315
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:33,409
signed by at least 100 millisecond from

316
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,570
the UTC will take the attacker at least

317
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:41,140
22 years in expectation and this is when

318
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:43,760
we consider an extreme case were out of

319
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,210
577 super are fully controlled by the

320
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,280
attacker

321
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,990
we also aquarii 15 services per hour and

322
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,610
so the examples are within 25

323
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,430
millisecond from the UTC we call this

324
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,679
this part L Omega and these parameters

325
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,140
are derived from an experiment that we

326
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,410
conducted on Amazon servers both in

327
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:07,310
Europe and in the US and here you can

328
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:12,530
see the benefit of using and the current

329
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:14,330
entropy as a function of access and the

330
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:18,740
number of servers that are quite a bit

331
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:21,139
probably and where each one here and I

332
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,500
present a different ratio of the

333
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,400
malicious server in between and so

334
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,060
consider pools four or five hundred

335
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,190
servers ap function of which are fully

336
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,929
controlled by the attacker and now we

337
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,660
compute the attacker probability of

338
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:39,200
success and four times to take attack

339
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,660
both in the traditional NTP client and

340
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,280
in constantly defines we plot the ratio

341
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,030
between these probabilities and this is

342
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,460
the one axis so if we consider the last

343
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,960
trial when we have out of 500 several

344
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,120
Thurman's for more fully controlled by

345
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,640
the attacker we can say that using a

346
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,719
course improve the security by a factor

347
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,790
of 1,000 and notice that there is no

348
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,450
great making that by the improvement is

349
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:08,330
exponential and now we are going to

350
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:11,300
describe our security analysis so in

351
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:14,960
order to do so we have to look at all

352
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,020
the scenario that can happen which

353
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,550
depends on the number of malicious

354
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:24,290
samples that we query and and see how

355
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:28,250
policies handling them of course we take

356
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,129
their words and I say my own they it was

357
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,000
cast in a lesson

358
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,820
and the first in iron is when the number

359
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,860
of the a good samples is the as you

360
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,320
remember out of hundreds of servers we

361
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,479
chose M chance at random and then we

362
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,780
differ on each side so in the first

363
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,390
scenario we have a the number of a good

364
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,460
samples you know this is as a yellow

365
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,100
engine it's higher than there and then

366
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,130
there are more malicious samples denoted

367
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,949
as the very diamond is less than I am

368
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,590
minus D so we have to our option here

369
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,740
because the first one is when we have

370
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,899
only a malicious sample women in our

371
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,480
remaining sets however we have more than

372
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,550
the good samples right so we have at

373
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,610
least one good sample in each side of

374
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:16,320
the remaining set which means and and

375
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:18,810
good samples are within origami from the

376
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,419
UTC from the correct time that is why

377
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:26,940
the remaining set samples should be also

378
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:28,350
close to the sick and the your averages

379
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,110
wheels in order to update our clock

380
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,610
eventually it's close to jettison the

381
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,550
second option is when we have at least

382
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:38,370
one good sample inside our remaining set

383
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:41,010
however according to our second if first

384
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,389
condition and all the samples in the

385
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,750
remaining set should be close to each

386
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,160
other our device we were some so if we

387
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,110
know that we have at least one good

388
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,110
sample in the remaining second it's

389
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,909
close to get a UTC the others should be

390
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,729
closely which means that their average

391
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,710
also will be close to the UTC and this

392
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,920
is why we can say that these attack

393
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,900
strategies are in effect the second

394
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,950
scenario is when number of the good

395
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:10,800
samples and is equal less than D and the

396
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,440
number of malicious or else is a high or

397
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,480
equal to your a minus D in the worst

398
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,420
case we have only malicious servers

399
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,650
remaining and they are not bounded by a

400
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:25,220
good samples however according to our

401
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:27,690
second condition their average which we

402
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,820
finally use in order to update our clock

403
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,270
should be close to the clients clock

404
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,780
which means that there is a boundary on

405
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:39,420
the time shift that we allow moreover

406
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,180
the probability of this kind of a

407
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,720
scenario is extremely low why because

408
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,110
each

409
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,510
and requires the malicious symbols to be

410
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,729
randomly chosen in much higher rate than

411
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:53,700
directing the population and of course

412
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,440
repeated shifts is a probability is

413
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,140
negligible this is why we can set a

414
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,929
significant time shift here is a

415
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:07,380
cocktail a prism but even if we cannot

416
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:10,440
really shift the can't stop clock maybe

417
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,900
we can create another kind of attack

418
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,289
let's say you know service so how can

419
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,510
how can we do that and if we have more

420
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:23,010
than D malicious server and less than a

421
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:25,408
mine and minus D good service good good

422
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,870
sample story then we have at least one

423
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:34,500
malicious sample that remain in our

424
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:36,479
rimming set right so it can violate for

425
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,700
example the first condition saying that

426
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,750
all the samples should be close to each

427
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,730
other and then caused us to sample we're

428
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,770
sampling again and again and again we

429
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,659
get to the panic mode when we ask all

430
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:57,139
the several in the book and maybe and

431
00:25:50,659 --> 00:26:00,419
multiple we're sampling by multiple

432
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:07,530
clients course client may cause denial

433
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:09,510
servers over the NTP servers however we

434
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,639
can prove that even for low panic

435
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:15,450
threshold K equals 3 with a means that

436
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,580
only after three failures you a move to

437
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,370
their panic mode and ask all the servers

438
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:23,250
in the pool the probability of success

439
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,850
is negligible which means that they it

440
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:30,080
will take the attacker decades to force

441
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:32,299
panic mode on oneself or not in one a

442
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,309
glance or

443
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:38,039
and one of it when we compare between

444
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:41,639
corners and REM TPD we see that corners

445
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:44,970
using greater variety of samples server

446
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,000
over time if ever possible security

447
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:51,510
guarantees is presented and it's a void

448
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,520
the NTP source quality and filters this

449
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,460
is why

450
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,760
it may be it is possible that address

451
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:04,320
and that there is a worse effect on its

452
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,590
precision and according so in order to

453
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,270
improve and the precision without

454
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:12,980
sacrificing and home security who

455
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:17,040
introduced us moaning mechanism and that

456
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,830
saying that we favor the minimum sample

457
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,710
of that out of order and offsetting the

458
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:26,580
remaining self and if it's close to the

459
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:28,620
to the average of we evaluate comes with

460
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,540
the small team optimism in

461
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,969
multiplication both in New York and in

462
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,490
the US and for example this is the

463
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,370
results from Oregon where you can see in

464
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:42,510
the its axis is the average offset and

465
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:44,790
in the y axis is the fluctuation and the

466
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:50,580
average of the derivative each dot here

467
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:53,520
we present through 30 minutes experiment

468
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,939
that conduct in each of these algorithms

469
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,720
and we compare NT pain in blue dot to

470
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:04,130
course with them the smooth mechanism in

471
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,260
the red dots and we can see here that

472
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:09,990
essentially the average offsets are

473
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,600
close to each other both in entropy as

474
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:18,960
in corners and there is no much

475
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:21,570
fluctuation so to conclude ntp is a

476
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,210
highly vulnerable to any time shifting

477
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:28,700
in tax and even attack here who controls

478
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:31,440
even few section in between server and

479
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,710
servers and client can shift the first

480
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,260
time so we presented a modified and the

481
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,210
client co-host with provable security

482
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,440
Mequon could come ability and low

483
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:46,200
overhead and we also shown that in home

484
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:51,360
say precision and offset are very close

485
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:53,940
to ntp around two millisecond upon and

486
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,959
this is their their research the further

487
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,610
research so we can we continue to

488
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,970
evaluate concept scale

489
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:06,330
security precision currency overhead etc

490
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,930
and we also working on standardized and

491
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,590
call

492
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:13,110
in the relevant a working group and we

493
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,899
would like to extend Hollis to address

494
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,429
in several attack strategies and of

495
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,590
course we would like to extend bonus to

496
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:23,940
maybe other time synchronization

497
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:27,659
protocol such as PT and here you can see

498
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:31,560
that there a link to both our paper

499
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:37,490
published in and and this s and our life

500
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:48,050
last ITF draft thank you very much and

501
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:52,260
thank you any questions

502
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:53,940
hi I'm Josh from Apple this is important

503
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,550
work thank you

504
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,960
I have little tip if you put numbers on

505
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,500
the slides it makes it easier to ask

506
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,090
questions so I don't know well side I

507
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,710
don't know what the slide number was but

508
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,970
earlier in the presentation you have a

509
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:10,980
graph showing how the probability

510
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,010
improves as the sample size improves

511
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,760
which makes perfect sense but it is kind

512
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:21,290
of a staircase shape and I was puzzled

513
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:28,560
what is the intuition why it's not a

514
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:31,110
monotonic increase in security like

515
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,129
going from 14 to 18 it gets worse and

516
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:38,280
then it improves at 20 okay this is just

517
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:41,130
an estimation and it's like but

518
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:45,600
basically we are because they're in

519
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:49,290
quantum losses between 4 & 6 servers we

520
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,860
didn't really calculate before and so

521
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:56,760
this is the answer about why it is get

522
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:59,790
worse and a white straight line and not

523
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:04,200
really increasing then and the answer is

524
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:07,620
that we would like to to remove this

525
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,020
from each side D was a once there and we

526
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,169
wanted you to be an integer number so

527
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,320
this is why you can see then it's tears

528
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:18,120
so is the conclusion that querying 8

529
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,649
servers actually gives you better

530
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:24,379
results than querying 12

531
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:28,970
no it's not it's not that no kind of

532
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:30,770
straight line but oh I see I think it's

533
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:38,090
not illusion so those lines are

534
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:39,889
horizontal are they active okay it's a

535
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:45,590
flat plateau I get it now okay yeah it

536
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:51,880
is and what we can see here is that even

537
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:55,010
if we are example only channeling

538
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,760
servers are kind of your time then still

539
00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:03,340
also improve the acquaintance TP by

540
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:05,540
to 100 hi what's heard occur I say um

541
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,030
good work I love taking a bit

542
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,490
statistical analysis of your security

543
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,980
likelihood I think that's great and it

544
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,140
looks like it's a feasible solution with

545
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,179
one exception so I assume it sounds like

546
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,770
you don't try and handle men in the

547
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:20,419
middle type attacks where you have an

548
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,850
attacker very close to you

549
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:25,549
that can almost respond to most NTP

550
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,379
servers right so that thank you yeah

551
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:29,059
exactly

552
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:33,950
yeah it's like if he controlled my

553
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:36,168
Gateway for example so yeah I'm from

554
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,540
Orange it seems like so your last

555
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:44,419
validation step is to compare to the

556
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:46,790
current clock right yes okay so if a

557
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,210
significant number of machines in a pool

558
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:53,210
gets a huge drift they will all switch

559
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:56,090
to panic mode as soon as this we switch

560
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,000
back on right you're talking about that

561
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:01,580
the current ntp or holes if you're

562
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,250
saying that if all the yeah for example

563
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,620
imagine a bunch of machines that we you

564
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,650
just remove from the network from

565
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,600
sometime and their clocks drift yeah and

566
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,090
then back you connect them back to the

567
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:20,240
Internet yeah okay so they all get to

568
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:23,230
panic mode and yes yeah now a dropper we

569
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,570
were saying that in a startup way and

570
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:29,619
for now he is

571
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:32,678
and panic mode at startup and mode but

572
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:34,869
we're working on it and maybe we can and

573
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:40,509
we don't have to really worry all the

574
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:43,570
service but only maybe in factor of two

575
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:48,249
of their server that would open query

576
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:50,830
and quantum maybe to em for example and

577
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:53,229
in order to get you to do the same with

578
00:33:50,830 --> 00:34:01,418
all so this is exactly what right thank

579
00:33:53,229 --> 00:34:02,710
you thank you hello there I look for the

580
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,759
answer in your paper but unfortunately

581
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,210
the link at the end of your presentation

582
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:17,379
doesn't work so I I'm gonna look for

583
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:19,030
your paper somewhere else yeah okay my

584
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:21,540
question is is there a general result

585
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:24,579
here with regards to security and the

586
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,699
digestion of untrusted sources that your

587
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:30,549
based on yeah the I think that then the

588
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:36,428
bottom line is that we can use a crowd

589
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:40,239
sourcing in order to maybe use and use

590
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:45,339
for instance honest as a watchdog to 20p

591
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:47,529
and see if there is a huge shift and

592
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:52,569
maybe we can move to it to more secure

593
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:56,940
mechanism okay and there is a working

594
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:56,940
link to the paper from the ITF to oxides

595
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:05,109
um so did you do any analysis on the

596
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,700
curve and entity blind with fixed so

597
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:09,940
prolonged entity kind has a fixture a

598
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,799
number of servers right that it quits

599
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,599
it's a it has a fixed number of our

600
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:16,509
service so with a fixed number of

601
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,670
servers um and using your modified

602
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:21,099
algorithm does it provide the similar

603
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:25,359
guarantees or is it similar security

604
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:27,700
guarantees if this client is querying a

605
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,630
fixed number of servers as opposed to

606
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:34,149
randomly selecting from a large pool and

607
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:37,119
using your modified algorithm for

608
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,730
selection does it give the similar

609
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:43,240
security guarantees or

610
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:45,309
if I fix the server is a in advance and

611
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,069
then just just drop deform each side

612
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:51,780
this is not asking so the problem is

613
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:55,420
that when when I do that so once I have

614
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:59,079
I have a malicious sapling in my

615
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:02,589
remaining sets it will continue to be in

616
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:06,010
my in my women set or it will be it will

617
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:08,650
continue being in India say I continue

618
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:11,980
to ask the same server again again again

619
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:13,660
and if he is not using if he's all it's

620
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,650
under the control of malicious attacker

621
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:22,470
then and he can do the repeated shift

622
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:26,170
time I mean I I allow it to do an

623
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:29,680
impaired limited time shift and the fact

624
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:32,200
that I I'm telling that with repeated

625
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,368
time shift is probabilities negligible

626
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,618
is because I am and querying different

627
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:42,089
service all the time otherwise I want to

628
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:42,089
be able to say that

629
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:52,300
okay any more questions

630
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:03,170
did you talk to the NCP working group

631
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:11,150
while you're here okay excellent we

632
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:13,870
wrote save our draft I'm glad to hear it

633
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:19,469
okay thank you very much

634
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:19,469
[Applause]

635
00:38:50,530 --> 00:39:03,750
I'm sorry guys it really does hell yeah

636
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:27,460
this is supposed to be user friendly I

637
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:30,000
worry about that if I lost my prize yes

638
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,000
all right

639
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:39,520
maybe this is gonna work

640
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:42,100
all right so the second talk is CJ Chang

641
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,000
from mr. instituted SEC you'll be

642
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,170
talking about DNS SEC deployments thanks

643
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,710
for the introduction Cowan

644
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:55,270
hi my name is TJ from RIT assistant

645
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:57,820
professor first of all I'm very excited

646
00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:01,240
to talk about research and actually this

647
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:05,290
is my first ITF and I'm really excited

648
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:10,600
to see how smart is the people making a

649
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:14,920
decision by humming so so this talk is

650
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:16,690
about DNS and DNS SEC so inevitably I

651
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,120
need to give you some introduction of

652
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,400
how DNS and DNS Edwards I'm little bit

653
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,970
scared to talk about the introduction

654
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,610
with you - in front of you actually make

655
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:31,390
a standard improving the internet but

656
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,490
let me try my best so DNS is like yellow

657
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,170
pages in your internet it translated

658
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:38,680
human readable name to machine readable

659
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:41,740
name such as IP address so I'm sorry

660
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:46,089
deep there should be a animation but

661
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:48,609
some yeah what's me see so when you send

662
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,780
the DNS request from your host when you

663
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,450
type a domain name when your browser

664
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:55,750
your browser is configured to use your

665
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:57,879
local reserve and the DNS resolver will

666
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,790
send the DNS request to D of very few

667
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,800
DNS servers and the server will return

668
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,540
the response to the reserver and

669
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,030
forwarded back to the browser

670
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:11,440
so that you can see their content right

671
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:14,200
but unfortunately unfortunately the

672
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,750
sinking it's not good but uh browser the

673
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,270
DNS message is just plain tats

674
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:22,030
so the bad guy in the middle of the

675
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:24,280
apes' can snatch the packet and insert

676
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,320
the wrong IP address to make you see the

677
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,390
different content such as advertisement

678
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:33,550
so to prove to prevent from this attack

679
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:37,420
DNS SEC was introduced about 20 years

680
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:40,030
ago the idea is very simple let's deploy

681
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:44,410
public and private key infrastructure on

682
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:46,630
a DNS site so example.com now managers

683
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:49,270
of key pair private and public key pairs

684
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,820
and the when the risk when the DNS

685
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:55,810
Rica's calms it responds with the

686
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:58,870
signature so to verify the signatures

687
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:03,040
the reserver also need to have a public

688
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:06,160
key part so the public key is in the DNS

689
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,000
key record so here is another problem

690
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,330
how the reserver guarantee that this

691
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,290
public key actually belongs to D example

692
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:20,170
comm so DNS SEC meters existing

693
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:24,160
hierarchy of DNS so now the comm John

694
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:27,190
also have DNS key public key and private

695
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,220
key and use this key to sign example

696
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:32,770
that counts DNS key and of course that

697
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,250
come John's a DNS key is also signed by

698
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:40,780
root DNS key then how does a reserver

699
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:43,330
verify the DNS root T it is prefetching

700
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:46,390
so as you can tell there is a chain of

701
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:49,690
trust root signs calm that comes on is

702
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:53,710
calm and example.com signs at the end

703
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:57,280
RTS a DNS record right so let's see how

704
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:01,710
this actual channel trust making a chain

705
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,090
of trust process works because the

706
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:08,410
making a chain of trust between

707
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:10,540
root and calm and calm and example.com

708
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,029
are basically saying so let's focus on

709
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:16,420
the later one so the key concept is very

710
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:18,880
simple so if you're the owner of example

711
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:21,330
calm and if you want to make a chain of

712
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,450
trust that when you need to do is first

713
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,750
generator

714
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:28,270
yes record so des record is just a hash

715
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:31,300
of your DNS key so it is based on a long

716
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:34,270
string long hash industry after that you

717
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:38,170
have to unload it to the your furniture

718
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:41,860
so in this case Stockinger then.com John

719
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:44,860
will sign this DNS key record and I'm

720
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,020
sorry for the animation and also it

721
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,890
generate a signature so when our

722
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,150
reserves

723
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:56,589
wants to verify if this DNS key is valid

724
00:43:52,150 --> 00:44:03,070
it has to fetch a DES record from the

725
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:05,140
turn John is challenging yes the

726
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,850
anything is challenging right so it was

727
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:20,310
introduced about 20 years ago but still

728
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:20,310
not working right alright so yeah

729
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:38,050
eagle-eye right

730
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:40,450
alright here we go yeah so if we

731
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,880
reserved a path choose TS record from

732
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:45,189
the parent own and fetch attendance key

733
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,050
from the child journey if it is same

734
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,540
then it's not of course you need to

735
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:53,380
verify the signature of the TS record

736
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:56,259
signed by the conjurer of course so if

737
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:58,330
you're the owner of a domain name if you

738
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,090
want to deploy the Unison you need to

739
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:04,810
follow these three steps first you need

740
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:07,180
to have a DNS key and using this key you

741
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:10,480
have to generate a signature at the last

742
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:14,169
step you have to generate a TS record

743
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,020
and upload it to your printer so the

744
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:19,360
question and answer for this research on

745
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,759
this analysis is how many domains out

746
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,940
there follow these steps so to do that

747
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,950
we used open Intel dataset which

748
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,260
collects all the domain names on the

749
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,770
recom that earth and that almost two

750
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,550
years

751
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:38,720
so let's see actually there was a black

752
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:40,610
box to hide the graph to make a CD to

753
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,569
make a surprise but it is already

754
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:45,530
revealed

755
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:49,490
surprisingly we found that only 1% of

756
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:52,850
the maze deployed DNS key even though it

757
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:59,689
was introduced about 20 years ago so but

758
00:45:52,850 --> 00:46:02,360
the good part is it's growing so ok then

759
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,790
how about these signatures so y-axis

760
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:19,700
shows percent of domain some missing

761
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:22,190
signature so yep so y axis shows percent

762
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:27,560
of missing signatures so as you can tell

763
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:30,260
nearly 0.2% of domain names with DNS key

764
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,100
missed the signature so signatures are

765
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,470
rarely missing

766
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,618
there is a huge draw at this point this

767
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:39,020
is two to one all registrar I don't want

768
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:41,450
to call name but they used to have a DNS

769
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:44,210
they all a wiki kept with DNS key but

770
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:46,490
some reason they forgot to sign it

771
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,820
but after at that point they finally

772
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:52,520
signed generated signatures so that is

773
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,920
the reason why there is a huge drop then

774
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,070
how about the finer one the last piece

775
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:01,400
of puzzle is you need to generate a TS

776
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:04,640
record and upload it to the printer so Y

777
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:08,060
axis is percent of domains missing yes

778
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,600
record surprisingly we found that nearly

779
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:14,779
30 percent of domains do not another TS

780
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:18,049
record so as you can tell there are two

781
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:21,170
problems here first one is why does he

782
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:24,440
make the intersect deployment remains so

783
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:26,900
small even though it was introduced

784
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,990
about 20 years ago and the second

785
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:34,280
problem is why are 30 percent of domains

786
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:39,509
still without a TS record now why the

787
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:42,360
screen is not working so so there

788
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:45,270
you question main question for desktop

789
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:48,000
the first one is why is so hard to

790
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:49,920
deploy the intersect and be as you can

791
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,100
tell from the title title of this talk

792
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,030
how does a register policy of the

793
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:59,819
deployment

794
00:47:54,030 --> 00:48:01,950
so let's first focus on the first one so

795
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,380
to understand that you have to

796
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:07,560
understand how you can purchase your

797
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:09,750
domain name and how to deploy the NSA so

798
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,090
let's say if you want to buy a domain

799
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:14,490
name you typically go to a register for

800
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:16,110
example cadet the registrar is

801
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:19,259
organization that sells that domain name

802
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:22,170
to the public and also it has a access

803
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,330
to the database managed by registry so

804
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:27,440
registry is a basically top-level domain

805
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:28,620
name John for example comm is managed by

806
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,770
Verisign

807
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:34,740
and after that after purchasing a domain

808
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:37,650
name you also need to have a name

809
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:40,470
servers the first choice you can make is

810
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:43,980
you can just use a name server provided

811
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:47,459
by the registrar so in this case if you

812
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:51,180
want to deploy at the NSA then GoDaddy

813
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:54,870
will generate a DNS key signatures and

814
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:57,149
also TS record right and also it has an

815
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:59,730
access to the database menus by registry

816
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:03,090
so that it can simply easily unload a

817
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,800
key s record to the registry right the

818
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:08,340
second choice is you can run your own

819
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,460
names over you bought a host and after

820
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:14,310
that um install a bind or the NSX

821
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:17,160
software generated signatures as well as

822
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:21,299
the S record but here you do not have

823
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:25,379
any any access to the registry so what

824
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:28,470
you need to do is to generate a DF 3

825
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:32,420
curd and give it to the Registrar and

826
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:36,180
ask them to unload it to the registry

827
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:41,580
let's say you're using third-party DNS

828
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:43,770
operator third party knows operator so

829
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,410
in this case for example Claude Fleur

830
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:47,640
will manage all the DNS records for you

831
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,690
including generating

832
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,950
signatures ts record but again

833
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,310
third-party DNS operator doesn't have

834
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:57,120
any

835
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:59,250
to the registry so you need to copy the

836
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,730
string D s record which is basically a

837
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:05,370
long stream copied and pasted pass it to

838
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:08,490
the register and ask them to upload it

839
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:11,520
to the registry if you think this

840
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:14,879
process is complex actually I can make

841
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,180
it even worse so for example let's say

842
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,590
you bought a domain name from a reseller

843
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,240
reseller is organization that sells

844
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,190
aluminum to the public but it doesn't

845
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,069
have any or 32 Connect contact with your

846
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:27,840
registry so what they do is to partner

847
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:30,330
with a registrar

848
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,450
so if you purchase a domain name from a

849
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:35,790
reseller and using a third party knows

850
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:38,339
operator then you need to copy a TS

851
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:40,440
record and pass it to the reseller and

852
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:44,190
ask them to upload it to the registrar

853
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:49,170
and registry such a simple process what

854
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:52,410
could possibly go wrong so as you can

855
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:55,740
tell the key part of the pointyness egg

856
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:58,920
is register so what I'm going to do is

857
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:01,680
I'm going to show you is we showing the

858
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,660
research that we surveyed by surveying

859
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,919
popular register with lots of domain

860
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:10,080
name so what we do is we first purchase

861
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,870
a domain name from a registrar and we

862
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,799
see if they simply support the NSF on

863
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:16,859
their name servers

864
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:19,380
after that we disable it we run our own

865
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:22,350
name servers generate a TS record and

866
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:25,710
ask them if you guys can unload a TS

867
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:28,380
record to the registry if they do we

868
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:30,480
deliberately give them an inquiry TS

869
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,540
record which is not matched with the NF

870
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,820
ski the reason is that because if the

871
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,400
registrar does not check the validity of

872
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:41,220
the DNS key and the TS record and simply

873
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,680
upload it to the registry then your

874
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:46,799
domain name will be instantly in

875
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,649
accessible to the reserver that support

876
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,700
DNS set such as Google reserver or call

877
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:56,100
or cloud ler wizard so if we're showing

878
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,680
this before showing me all the details

879
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,960
of the analysis I'm going to give you

880
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,690
some anecdotal examples that we

881
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,270
experienced your during our experiment

882
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,260
the first one is we started the NS key

883
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:10,680
deployment

884
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:13,080
boy for one register but not the Ezra

885
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,240
so ask why you guys do not have noted

886
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,960
the s record the first response was that

887
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,060
Oh they removed at the NSA me and the

888
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,460
other another red is for responded back

889
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:26,460
to me saying that hey most people do not

890
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:30,510
understand DNS so imagine their white

891
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:33,600
faces when I mention DNS SEC so yeah

892
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:36,120
this this what happened and also we

893
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,089
asked a register to unload a TS record

894
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,640
by email from the different email August

895
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:46,050
and the one we use to register it was

896
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,759
installed successfully and also we asked

897
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:51,660
already start to him that ideas record

898
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,650
to our web our domain name domain via a

899
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,299
web live chat

900
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:59,310
he was installed successfully to someone

901
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,920
else domain name due to a mistake by

902
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:04,440
customer agent yeah usually the customer

903
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,410
Asian you know opens a multiple pad to

904
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,480
deal with multiple customers so just

905
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:11,310
made a mistake to pay city s record to

906
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,970
the other domain so this is the detail

907
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:18,930
hey I'd like to update my TS record it's

908
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:22,220
awesome one moment so I now update your

909
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:26,430
DNS a TS record to an end using a comp

910
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:27,930
right I'm sorry but my domain is Aug the

911
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,950
intersect that come oh I apologize

912
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:32,759
you're silly me

913
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:37,890
yep you're right silly one moment so

914
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:40,140
after I the risk that these responds I

915
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,640
try to connect the piano music calm

916
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,560
using my you know using Google

917
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:49,230
researchers but the response was sir

918
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:50,730
failure yeah so this is the research

919
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:54,570
survey research that we surveyed about

920
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:57,120
a20 registrar detects about a 50% on

921
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:59,480
nearly 50% of all domain names of the

922
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:03,540
combat or the net

923
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,880
sadly only four registers support the

924
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,610
NSF on their name servers which is not

925
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,890
good

926
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:12,600
for your information we read on actually

927
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,060
the study was done about twenty seven

928
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:20,640
twenty seventy but for their stuff we

929
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:25,380
just redid all the survey few weeks ago

930
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,359
and after that we disable our we run our

931
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,680
own name servers and disable the default

932
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,810
names that were provided by the

933
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:34,140
registrar and we asked them to a lot

934
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:36,870
ideas record interestingly 15 out of 20

935
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,020
12 are supported he has record under so

936
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:41,460
mainly there are two functions

937
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:43,710
functionalities the first one is for

938
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:46,680
example web supporting ticket or web

939
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:48,780
live chat so using this methodology they

940
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,270
all those ups terminal yes record or

941
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,370
some registrar's ask us to send the

942
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:55,580
email with the you know content is of

943
00:54:53,370 --> 00:55:00,420
course the long string of a yes record

944
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:03,390
and sadly only 5 out of 20

945
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:07,470
check the verification so yeah if you

946
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:09,120
happen to deliver incorrect yes record

947
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,370
your domain name will be instantly

948
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:16,350
inaccessible to DT and as a supporting

949
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:20,880
reservist so here's a summary only 4 out

950
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:23,430
of 20 support for our 20 redress of for

951
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,790
DNS SEC on their name servers what this

952
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,950
means to you is if you don't want to run

953
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:32,490
your own names over most of the time you

954
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:35,759
cannot deploy a set if you want to run

955
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:38,120
your own name solvers still you cannot

956
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,100
deploy them except for 5 out of 20 and

957
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:43,259
only 5 already serves up for check it

958
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,000
out yes record verification which means

959
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,280
if you happen to another incorrectly s

960
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,350
record you to copy and paste theater

961
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,380
then your domain name will be

962
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:55,650
inaccessible right then the next

963
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:58,490
question is why are this Genesis support

964
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:00,270
of registers so rare why why is that

965
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:03,240
actually we already know the answer

966
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:06,120
because the anisette introduced much

967
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,850
more records right because basically in

968
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,850
this signature for every DNS records and

969
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:14,759
also signatures are usually three to six

970
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:17,370
times larger than non dns records and

971
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,740
also the NFC is like your password you

972
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:22,200
have to choose strong key and also

973
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,839
unique key and also you have to roll

974
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:29,549
over the key regularly in a regular

975
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:31,730
basis actually you already seen why how

976
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:34,490
this policy impact on the intersect

977
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:37,310
deployment for example

978
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:39,700
we saw that four out of 20 registered

979
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:44,900
support DNS set on their name servers

980
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:47,868
but in personally 15 out of 20 on allow

981
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:50,390
us to another key aspect right the thing

982
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:53,119
is in the first case when the

983
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:55,580
registrar's run began our names over

984
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,150
with DNS SEC they need to manage all DNS

985
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:03,319
records in their name servers but the if

986
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:05,720
the owner wants to run their own name

987
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,119
servers than what the registrar needs to

988
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,830
do is to simply receive what the yes

989
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:11,450
record and unload it to the registry

990
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:16,580
done they don't need to manage all the

991
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:22,189
cancer occurs at all so so let's compare

992
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:25,400
the 2017 research so our study was done

993
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:28,040
in 2017 March so at the time only three

994
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,990
out of 20 registered supported the TNF

995
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,390
secondary name servers at the register

996
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:35,180
side name servers and 11 out of 20

997
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:37,549
supporting it when the users want to use

998
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,160
their own running servers and proud of

999
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:44,599
them check the verification so as you

1000
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,950
can tell it has been improved but yep

1001
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,800
it has to be improved it's much better

1002
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:53,960
than you know decreasing you know still

1003
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:56,930
way to go so let's now let's switch gear

1004
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,510
to how the register how does a registrar

1005
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:03,160
policy impact on the deployment to see

1006
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:07,369
that we also use the historical data set

1007
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:09,649
so to see that we first focused on the

1008
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:11,839
comm that worked on that data set but as

1009
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:15,650
you already seen the deployment ratio is

1010
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:18,320
a very small less than 1% but we happen

1011
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:21,470
to know that that and now that I see

1012
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:24,200
this to cctlds the NSA deployment ratio

1013
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:28,220
is nearly 50% which is really good and

1014
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:30,259
also we updated our data set by

1015
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,848
considering the most recent data set

1016
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:34,940
2019

1017
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:37,310
actually the the percent with the image

1018
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:40,160
get filled is a hidden due to the menu

1019
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:47,259
and mission fall but uh it was increased

1020
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:52,960
by 0.1 percent yeah but still increased

1021
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:55,060
so so let's see how the how a registered

1022
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,070
policy impact on genetic deployment in

1023
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:59,680
other words how can we encourage your

1024
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:02,920
register to support the assay the first

1025
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,549
a perspective is registry so we happen

1026
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:09,100
to notice that the kpn touch registrar

1027
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:11,230
Alypius redish register in a financial

1028
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,110
incentive from the registry registry

1029
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:16,720
when they activate the intersect for the

1030
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:19,960
domain names they manage so as you can

1031
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,970
tell that NL that has it is - domain

1032
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:26,160
names the uninfected ployment ratio is

1033
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:30,549
nearly 90 percent which is awesome but

1034
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:34,029
how about the other three domain names

1035
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:37,030
teller than other Netcom where they

1036
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,750
cannot get any financial incentive so as

1037
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:40,630
you can tell

1038
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:42,030
actually I already draw the figure

1039
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:46,570
outline here

1040
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:48,430
it's nearly 0% so which means financial

1041
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:50,560
gain is a huge incentive for the point

1042
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:54,120
in a sec they only deployed in a sec

1043
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:57,970
when they can get a financial incentive

1044
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,839
the second perspective is registered so

1045
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:02,560
we found that

1046
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:04,990
obh and GoDaddy - registers on

1047
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:08,680
supporting DNR secondary for name

1048
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:12,160
servers but OVH provides it for free but

1049
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:15,819
GoDaddy you have to obtain by paying $35

1050
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,790
3 contractivity anderson as you can as

1051
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:21,610
you can expect the OVH DNS circuit

1052
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:25,960
paloma ratio is over 20% but code Adi is

1053
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:29,020
nearly 3 percent so free DNS tab of

1054
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:32,350
course support and encourage encourages

1055
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:36,580
user to deploy in a sec and the third

1056
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:38,710
perspective is reseller C of one

1057
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,319
umbrella spherical antagonist is a

1058
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:43,420
registrar for NL domain name but there

1059
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,760
are reseller Furtick on the coordinate

1060
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:48,280
so the top graph shows the number of

1061
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,920
domains they manage and the bottom graph

1062
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,530
shows the percent of domains with a DNF

1063
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:57,580
ski and the TS record so as you can tell

1064
01:00:53,530 --> 01:01:00,850
from the white line the DNS exploration

1065
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:03,310
for an L is nearly 100% which is good

1066
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:07,839
but interestingly we observed that there

1067
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:11,200
is a gradual deployment increasing ratio

1068
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:14,040
for the other domain names the reason

1069
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,520
instead this register his antagonist

1070
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:22,360
actually started to deploy the NSA at

1071
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:25,810
the end of 20 2014 but what what

1072
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:29,230
happened was they switch it a register

1073
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:31,450
the supporting of the NSA but the

1074
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:35,040
migration only happens when the current

1075
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:37,560
domain name expires so they after the

1076
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,509
previous domain name expires they

1077
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:43,060
migrate to a new registrar that supports

1078
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:47,050
the NSA so that is the reason why you

1079
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:49,350
can see kind of gradual deployment so

1080
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:52,270
complex relationship between reseller

1081
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:56,110
registrar also result in a and of slow

1082
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:58,870
deployment of the NSA and the other

1083
01:01:56,110 --> 01:02:01,030
perspective is third-party desecrater so

1084
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:03,850
for your recall if you are using a

1085
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:06,700
third-party DNS operator if you want to

1086
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:09,040
use the NF SEC then you have to copy a

1087
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:11,770
TS record from a third-party insulator

1088
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:15,580
and a pass it to your registrar and ask

1089
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:17,680
them to upload it to D registry so

1090
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:22,480
CloudFlare actually announced the

1091
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:24,730
universal DNS SEC and 2016 early 2016 so

1092
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,310
user if you want to use cloth layers the

1093
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:30,030
NSA you have to opt in and CloudFlare

1094
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:34,210
the NS over will generate a DNS key

1095
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:37,240
signature as well as PS record so what

1096
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:40,390
you need to do is copy a distant a TS

1097
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:42,180
record and pass it to the registrar to

1098
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:46,810
ask them to note it to the registry but

1099
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:49,270
the khakhra shows percent of DNS key

1100
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:51,580
with TS record or interestingly even

1101
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:54,250
though the DNS key deployment in the

1102
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:57,670
bottom graph increasing right but still

1103
01:02:54,250 --> 01:03:00,790
50 percent of domain names with the NF

1104
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:03,070
ski still failing to deploy the s record

1105
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:05,110
this could be either one the

1106
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:07,450
administrators didn't understand

1107
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:10,840
correctly what how to deploy the answer

1108
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:13,600
quickly or their registrar does not

1109
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:17,440
simply allow the users to unload

1110
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:20,740
ts record so deploying the NSTIC is even

1111
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:25,020
harder for our users using third-party

1112
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:29,049
limits operator so here's a conclusion

1113
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:31,900
so registrar's play a critical role in

1114
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:34,480
supporting DNS SEC today only four out

1115
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:36,370
of two actually is for a 4 out of 20

1116
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,380
register support the inner cylinder of

1117
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:41,470
their cue name servers or interestingly

1118
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:44,110
15 out of 20 support unloading OTS a

1119
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:47,109
custom yes record so comparing to the

1120
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:50,380
Reaser of 2017 it has been improved but

1121
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:52,330
it requires much more at roughly so the

1122
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:55,450
NSF deploy depends on many policies

1123
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:58,509
register is supported for free registry

1124
01:03:55,450 --> 01:04:01,000
it'll be great if it they can offer

1125
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:03,990
financial incentive and reseller be over

1126
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,950
to choose a partner register and also

1127
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:08,709
when you're using third-party

1128
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:11,140
I guess the CD CD nm scheme new protocol

1129
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:13,270
which although users to another TS

1130
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,890
record directly to the registry and

1131
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:19,990
without any support from the registrar

1132
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:25,210
will this will be very good solution I

1133
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:27,399
guess so that's it and uh I thanks for

1134
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:28,440
your attention and I'm happy to take any

1135
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:37,750
questions

1136
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:39,850
Hey thank you that was an excellent talk

1137
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:41,560
it's very difficult circumstances with

1138
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:43,589
the projector does anyone have any

1139
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,590
questions

1140
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:57,470
let's her to Cariah saya great talk

1141
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:00,440
entertaining too and I don't mean

1142
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:02,868
because of the projector looking are you

1143
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,180
doing are you continuing to do long

1144
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:09,769
running statistics gather gathering and

1145
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:11,058
are you publishing it live at all and

1146
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:13,189
then I might offer to collaborate a

1147
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:14,299
little bit so I actually have a webpage

1148
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:17,180
called stats

1149
01:05:14,299 --> 01:05:20,029
in a sec - tool tour where we in Victor

1150
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,009
Duchovny publish continually daily

1151
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:24,529
updating stats of DNS SEC deployment and

1152
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:26,059
Dane deployment in particular and it

1153
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:28,460
would be really cool to merge those I

1154
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:29,599
think yeah Victor has a lot of data that

1155
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,980
you probably don't have it you have a

1156
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,559
lot of data that I think Victor doesn't

1157
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,400
have so we should talk yep sure

1158
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:36,529
absolutely

1159
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,940
but are you running it continually or

1160
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:39,940
you yep okay awesome

1161
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:51,230
hi my stock

1162
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:54,529
this is palladin RS from Salesforce so

1163
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:56,809
one of the angle to this whole research

1164
01:05:54,529 --> 01:06:00,410
could be and I'm speaking from

1165
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:04,999
experience is that when the client is

1166
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:07,910
big like if your domain name is used by

1167
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:11,480
a lot of customers you try to make the

1168
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:14,480
domain name multi vendor so you might

1169
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:19,730
have your zone hosted on maybe

1170
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:23,329
CloudFlare provider so your zone might

1171
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:25,489
be xyz.com or whatever might be multi

1172
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:28,309
vendor where it's hosted on or at one

1173
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:32,720
android or two in that case again

1174
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:35,690
achieving DNS SEC it's hard because just

1175
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:38,238
matching the keys and des record so

1176
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:41,569
that's another angle that you can look

1177
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:45,109
at of the zones that you are scanning if

1178
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:48,019
they are multi vendor in that case also

1179
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:51,049
they may not be it's not easy to do DNS

1180
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:54,680
signing and all that so we actually have

1181
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:56,779
a draft ENS ops related to this but

1182
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,339
we'll be happy to talk to you about it

1183
01:06:56,779 --> 01:07:00,529
yeah actually I'm not familiar with the

1184
01:06:58,339 --> 01:07:05,310
area but I'm happy to take a look yeah

1185
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:09,150
thanks all right

1186
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:12,930
yep nice presentation um you might also

1187
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:15,570
on those some 30% that don't have D s

1188
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:17,069
records one of the very common things

1189
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:19,080
that happens is people start playing

1190
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:20,310
with DNS SEC and the first thing they do

1191
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,870
when they aren't sure is though Yankee

1192
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:25,410
BS records from the parent because then

1193
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:28,319
you simply um go undetermined as opposed

1194
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:29,940
to going invalid so you may want to

1195
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,860
start going back and resampling on a

1196
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:34,050
recurring basis of who may have d s

1197
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:35,970
records appearing and disappearing yep

1198
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,100
it's also one of the vectors that people

1199
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,419
are using with hijackings that the first

1200
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,580
thing they will do is they will change

1201
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,020
and remove the D s records and change

1202
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:48,870
the industry and the parent and start

1203
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:49,770
playing games can I respond to that as

1204
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:52,650
well

1205
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:56,130
so I would run of the coasters is it

1206
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:57,420
paper we looked at that and it's not

1207
01:07:56,130 --> 01:08:00,060
people playing around with Deena sake

1208
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:02,970
it's people simply not deploying

1209
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:04,560
deploying IDs in one TLD they sign

1210
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:07,709
everything they own they signed a whole

1211
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:09,150
portfolio but then they only deploy the

1212
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:11,070
s and the T of these that give them a

1213
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:15,300
financial incentives such as not

1214
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:16,620
available to see there are some positive

1215
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:19,529
side effects because there are people

1216
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:21,358
that sign everything because of the

1217
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:24,960
financial incentive but then I also

1218
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:29,069
deployed yes in every TLD which is what

1219
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,359
people should have been doing and there

1220
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:32,310
are some positive side effects from

1221
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,810
other incentives that till they are not

1222
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:37,950
deploying for example for the deployment

1223
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:41,339
of Dame TLS a records where you see as a

1224
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:43,679
side effect also an uptake of of the NS

1225
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:45,778
a cane in other T of these than the ones

1226
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:48,120
that deployed the incentives so I'd like

1227
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:50,460
to applaud Ulrich who is over there for

1228
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:59,189
the CC for deploying that incentive as

1229
01:08:50,460 --> 01:09:01,649
well thanks Roland I am polished from

1230
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:05,068
this religion to my foundation we do run

1231
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:07,649
messy so I just would say a very nice

1232
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:11,549
work and the only critique I have it

1233
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:13,740
that you didn't test our registrar's you

1234
01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:15,180
didn't just our registrar's we would

1235
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:17,969
like to have this test on our Vegas

1236
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:19,109
truss because it's we want to promote

1237
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:21,060
the NS second

1238
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:24,589
some very good work and we've been

1239
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,589
looking to thank you thanks so much

1240
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:31,500
Rick well how embarrassing I'm just one

1241
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:33,600
question in the and chart 24 one good

1242
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:37,819
presentation certainly appreciate it

1243
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:42,060
on 24 this is where sort of the 15 odd

1244
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:44,149
let me see a different chart 24 this is

1245
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:47,640
where the chart where the 15 out of 20

1246
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:50,670
20 comes up and I'm curious as to why

1247
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,460
the the ones that provide the upload by

1248
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:56,010
email yeah this one here why they

1249
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:59,070
weren't counted as being supportive of

1250
01:09:56,010 --> 01:10:00,930
DNS SEC even though they don't appear to

1251
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:04,259
do it based on when the research was

1252
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:06,300
done through their web portal they those

1253
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,180
registrar's you indicate here do support

1254
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,730
you I'm sorry can you repeat I'm sorry

1255
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:13,740
good backward so on this chart this is

1256
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:15,959
where the number 15 out of 20 comes from

1257
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:18,030
yet ones that support their curious as

1258
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,780
to why the ones in the lower right

1259
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:21,690
corner

1260
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:26,120
those those there weren't included in

1261
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:26,120
that in the countess supporting DNS SEC

1262
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:33,630
yeah included if I are okay okay my bit

1263
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:35,719
so the the other five but you don't name

1264
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:39,600
the other five registrar's the others

1265
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:41,610
okay I registered you know they don't do

1266
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,180
anything okay no um and then the only

1267
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:47,040
other thing I would offer is that in the

1268
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:49,890
in the at least in the calm registry

1269
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,810
there's a very large number as

1270
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:54,600
recognized lots of registrar's

1271
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:57,390
participate and with varying levels of

1272
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:59,490
participation for both allowing DNS SEC

1273
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:06,590
through their portal and also with the

1274
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:06,590
other names yep okay

1275
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,940
Jody called her from GoDaddy

1276
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:18,500
I'm just curious do you have any data on

1277
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:22,639
maybe the top hundred thousand Alexa

1278
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:25,670
websites that are using DNS SEC yes we

1279
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,860
do but not for this paper actually we

1280
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:30,560
probably see the one on another paper at

1281
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:33,139
the usually Security 2017 there is a

1282
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:36,650
research for the Alexa 1 billion website

1283
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:39,320
if they saw the ratio beats on domain

1284
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:42,290
names of Indiana SEC but it's very low

1285
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:44,000
it's less than 2% I guess so why do you

1286
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:46,640
think that some of the largest retailers

1287
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,300
don't use DNS SEC they are the most

1288
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:52,489
vulnerable for this aren't they I'm

1289
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:54,980
sorry can reap it sure why do the

1290
01:11:52,489 --> 01:12:00,080
largest retailers on the internet and

1291
01:11:54,980 --> 01:12:01,849
largest retailers retailers register no

1292
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,559
the peoples that may get money off the

1293
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:09,739
internet like Amazon why do they not use

1294
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:16,010
DNS SEC if anyone's from Amazon is here

1295
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:22,400
I'd love to hear the answer Google fire

1296
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:27,050
to the Sergey oh I'm sorry I I have no

1297
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:31,549
idea they should supporting it but I

1298
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:34,160
think what the issue is here is that as

1299
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:35,600
many domains that you're looking at most

1300
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,950
of them are for small to medium

1301
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,020
businesses hmm

1302
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:42,980
small to medium businesses don't have an

1303
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:46,190
IT department mm-hmm they also probably

1304
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:48,769
don't really understand DNS so heading

1305
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:56,059
DNS SEC on top of that doesn't make that

1306
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:58,580
any better for them yes but first small

1307
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:01,430
companies and the we thought we many

1308
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:03,110
times these are anecdotal examples we

1309
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:05,000
sometimes or observe these small

1310
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:07,219
companies just relying on the default

1311
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,320
names over it means if I register so

1312
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:11,239
that is why we are encouraging all

1313
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:13,400
registers to support NSA on their

1314
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:15,530
default name servers if that's the case

1315
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,540
then they don't the small companies to

1316
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:19,759
do not need to care about the intercept

1317
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:23,920
because it will automatically turn the

1318
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,920
dns set sure

1319
01:13:25,559 --> 01:13:36,610
okay well thank you again okay so that's

1320
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:38,619
everything for this meeting thank you

1321
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:40,719
again to both the speaker something that

1322
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:44,650
was two really excellent talks I think

1323
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:46,630
both TJ and Mehta will be around for at

1324
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:48,308
least tomorrow I think possibly most of

1325
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,709
the week so if you're interested in the

1326
01:13:48,309 --> 01:13:59,079
work please grab them in the hallways

1327
01:13:49,709 --> 01:14:02,489
and thank you for your attention if you

1328
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:02,489
can pass the blue sheets to the front
