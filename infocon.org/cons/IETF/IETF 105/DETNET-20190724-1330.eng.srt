skyress with me

2
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,920
hey hi good afternoon welcome everyone

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,959
this is the that networking group

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,190
meeting Ruiz and myself are the chairs

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,830
and Ethan is our secretary he is remote

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,949
couldn't make it to this meeting you

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:44,070
find the downline the agenda on line at

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,480
the usual place and the working group

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:52,860
information this is the high tea of

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,140
no-tell as a reminder and remind you

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,480
that by participating the ITF you agree

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,140
to follow the idea processes and

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,910
policies if you are ever that any idea

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,550
of contributions covered by patents or

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,619
patent applications that are owned or

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,350
controlled by you or your sponsor

17
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,649
you must disclose that fact or not

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:18,210

19
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:21,030
remind you that there is permanent

20
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,820
recording and by participating and

audio and video and photo photographic

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,920
records are made at these meetings if

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,990
you are not familiar with the note 4

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,119
then please study I mentioned the

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,929
recording and the mini taking we use it

27
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:47,130
to pad please please join in to pad this

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,590
is join mini taking and correct if some

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,750
something was not captured for example

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,010
your name as we discussed you may have

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,869
difficulty to capture that chapter and

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,200
don't know an agenda was mentioned

33
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,850
already the blue sheets are going on

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,240
please fill in the blue sheets with your

35
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,459
name and affiliation we have two

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,140
sessions this afternoon - that night

37
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:15,930
sessions this one and Burbridge week and

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,339
the afternoon session - both sessions

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:25,290
are in this meeting room and this is the

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:28,950
detailed agenda kind of the agenda items

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,459
in the order of the ones being progress

42
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,140
most forests are the first I would not

43
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,730
read out the agenda you can find it

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,160
online this is for the session - so this

45
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,970
is the plan to go to these items in this

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:49,890
order and important to highlight that we

47
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:54,000
use the mailing list to build the

48
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,309
consensus so the working of decisions

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,720
are made on the mailing list discussion

50
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,150
is means made under a list so please

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:07,140
bring your items to release discuss and

52
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:10,950
and comment the documents you will hear

53
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,670
a couple of comments if you wish in the

54
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:20,310
ones we are about to finalize or bring

55
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:23,849
in new topics and so on up here

56
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:28,459
I mentioned that IP ours has to be

57
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:32,220
disclosed and we are making cava patents

58
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,620
prior moving to next steps with working

59
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,890
of documents before adoption and working

60
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,680
up a score or each author has to respond

61
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,629
to this course

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,790
this is status update on where we are

63
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:51,780
with our documents in the working group

64
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,489
we have two new offices out the problem

65
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,280
statement and use cases

66
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,069
thank you very much for will contributed

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,519
so these are the first RFC's of the

68
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:06,390
working group and the architecture is

69
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:09,450
with the RFC editor we are making fine

70
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,700
publishing a couple of last edits are in

71
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:16,798
the queue and hopefully it gets

72
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:20,370
published very soon the first look you

73
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,330
see here as own agenda is the data plane

74
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:28,500
documents the dark green ones are the

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,539
ones more stable we plan to pass coal

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,390
after the meeting but we will discuss

77
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:36,240
more in detail during the agenda during

78
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,250
the data plane presentation and the

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,350
green ones are followed by the flow

80
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,300
information with

81
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,140
that is progressing as well as the end

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,080
documents building on the flow

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,659
information model there is a new one the

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,820
Lila Kuan recently adopted by the

85
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,680
working group on the bounded latency and

86
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,030
one of the working group graphs is not

87
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,360
on agenda it is a Security draft this

88
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:08,780
has been gated by previous documents the

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,390
actually the architecture and the data

90
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,299
plane solution documents now those are

91
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,880
getting major so I would expect making

92
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,480
your next steps with the security draft

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,130
as well so in comparison to our

94
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,820
milestones of our divorce as a working

95
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:32,480
group the architecture is is done pretty

96
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,610
much I would say and security as I

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,190
mentioned will be catching up hopefully

98
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,650
very soon and we made a great progress

99
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,420
in documenting the data plane definition

100
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,570
so actually there is no technical

101
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:48,230
changes but the documentation was the

102
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,360
one that was progressing so we have we

103
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,190
have you will see more in detail I not

104
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:59,110
talk about that and I mentioned the flow

105
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:59,110
information and the end Manas was it

106
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,800
keep in mind where contribution driven

107
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,260
and we do take items into the working

108
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,640
group that are within charter and if you

109
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,289
have something that's outside of charter

110
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,030
we can discuss that we do have something

111
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,450
on the agenda today which is borderline

112
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:21,739
that the control plane information

113
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,810
document the control plane dock it is

114
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,180
within our charter to document control

115
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,550
plane requirements and perhaps even a

116
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,960
framework for solution but the solutions

117
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,000
themselves are outside our charter

118
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,210
current expectation is is that though

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,280
that will be addressed in the groups

120
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,739
that own those respective control plane

121
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,419
protocols if for some reason those

122
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,920
groups it doesn't make sense to do it in

123
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,420
those groups we can talk about doing it

124
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,300
here but that is something that would be

125
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,570
a broadening of the Charter required our

126
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,370
eighty and is G approval but other other

127
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,300
items are within charter please feel

128
00:06:52,370 --> 00:07:04,129
free to come with your

129
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:08,319
contributions so first up Don in place

130
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,319
of garage

131
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:41,679
so it I think the microphone is off

132
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:45,110
thank you Andy for letting us know hello

133
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:47,469
okay again my name is dawn Fedak and I'm

134
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,559
gonna talk about the data plane graphs

135
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:53,779
Balazs he's on vacation somewhere so but

136
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:55,789
he put these slides together but the

137
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,319
group of editors we worked in the drafts

138
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:04,308
together and we we worked on the

139
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:06,139
restructuring so prior to this we had

140
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:09,169
two data plane drafts we had an IP

141
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,809
solutions drought and MPLS solutions and

142
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,269
what the working group had agreed to do

143
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:17,029
was take a building block approach and

144
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:19,249
break the documents up into the the ones

145
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,649
you see on the right hand side so

146
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,239
there's a framework document and I'm

147
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:27,949
going to talk about each one of these an

148
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:31,878
IP document and MPLS document and a dead

149
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:35,659
net IP over MPLS documents and an MPLS

150
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:38,240
over UDP document we haven't made as

151
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,708
much progress on the TSN documents yet

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,169
we'll just include a little bit about

153
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:44,930
them so they're basically broken up into

154
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:47,269
the framework and the IP and mpls and

155
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:52,579
then some of the combinations that you

156
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:58,670
can do with them so the framework

157
00:08:52,579 --> 00:09:03,949
document is basically the overall aspect

158
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:07,459
of debt net looking at the the pieces

159
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:10,639
that are common across the technologies

160
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:12,559
it comes it covers basically the general

161
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,449
concepts and then each one of the data

162
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:18,980
playing drafts goes into more detail

163
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:22,040
with respect to that data plane so it

164
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,300
covers we have on the the right hand

165
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,829
side we have from the architecture the

166
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,899
the the layering that we've got so we

167
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:32,239
got the service sub layer and the

168
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,519
forwarding sub layer and then the lower

169
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,119
layers it's

170
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,740
and then we've got as services for for

171
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:42,100
deterministic networking we've got IP

172
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,600
and mpls and we talk about pieces like

173
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,939
the encapsulation specific metadata the

174
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,730
IP data plane the MPLS name plane and

175
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:54,969
then things like service protection

176
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,860
aggregation in systems in sub Network

177
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,240
and a little bit about controller

178
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,179
playing management and control

179
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,610
considerations and at the bottom side we

180
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:06,819
have a little bit of representation of

181
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,949
some service examples where that we said

182
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:11,618
building block approaches you may get it

183
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:17,889
all over one technology or you may use

184
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:21,879
combinations of the technology so for

185
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:26,259
the IP draft this content now is

186
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:29,379
specific to IP and with with ie with the

187
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:33,309
IP data playing basically you only have

188
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:38,920
the forwarding sub layer we're looking

189
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:43,269
at naturally at the elements in the IP

190
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:47,618
header the the six couple five double

191
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:51,579
and plus dessert code points for flow

192
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:54,970
identification and types of that

193
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:57,309
aggregation and things like that and on

194
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:02,470
the right hand side from the die from

195
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:06,759
the draft we have an example of a dead

196
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:09,699
net service that's end-to-end or below

197
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,829
that we have one where the the actual IP

198
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:15,008
service is not dead net aware but it

199
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:22,929
travels over top of a dead net IP

200
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:25,899
network so the the management and

201
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:27,879
control information summary for that it

202
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:31,389
you've got the various fields that you

203
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:33,850
can look at in the IP header so for v4

204
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:36,509
and v6 you've got source address source

205
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,399
prefix if you're doing aggregation

206
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:42,279
destination address field destination

207
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,459
prefix the protocol the next header

208
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:47,380
field in ipv6 you get the type of

209
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:52,829
service or the traffic class feel

210
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:56,080
and you may do some bit masking on those

211
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:58,480
there was some there was some comments I

212
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,210
see David going to the mic there were

213
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,060
some comments about the IP draft and

214
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,000
we're going to resolve those so there

215
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,280
was a discussion on there you want to

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,710
elaborate do you want finish the slides

217
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,240
or should I ask the question since I'm

218
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,450
trying to write the note text for you

219
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,410
right now as you're speaking I think

220
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,080
you're saying you want to wait to the

221
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,610
end no I think he said he wants to have

222
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,350
a discussion now so while you're talking

223
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,790
he can write the tech nutrition it's

224
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,700
probably actually what why don't you

225
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,900
finish it's real time fixing is

226
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,240
appreciated so if anything that helps

227
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,740
you write the right text we should do so

228
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,790
what are you what's your preference okay

229
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,290
you instill the right thing by the

230
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,939
working group finish the slides come

231
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,610
back this one and I'll ask question on

232
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:52,540
it okay all right David remember slide 5

233
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:55,450
so the rest of the fields that TCP and

234
00:12:52,540 --> 00:13:01,920
UDP source port and destination port and

235
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:01,920
then if it's IPSec the header SPI field

236
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,550
for MPLS we did the similar thing to IP

237
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,089
but now in the MPLS context so

238
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,750
everything in the MPLS document is dead

239
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:20,080
net with respect to MPLS so at the top

240
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,820
we have the representation of the the

241
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,980
service layer and the forwarding layer

242
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:30,790
and an MPLS that consists of a control

243
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,890
word and a service label or sometimes it

244
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,079
could be an aggregation label and for

245
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:42,220
the forwarding piece it's the at fly

246
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:45,340
ball for the what we all line the

247
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,100
various MPLS data plane procedures for

248
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,020
flow identification and sequence numbers

249
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,400
and then management and control

250
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:56,140
information and again in the diagrams

251
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,720
that come out of the document you've got

252
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,220
a little bit more detail in the header

253
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,610
stack that goes on there with the

254
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,410
control

255
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:07,870
and the service label and optionally the

256
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:15,790
forwarding labels if you have them or

257
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:18,640
not so in terms of MPLS there's a rich

258
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,319
set of features that are in there and we

259
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,390
can talk about them and we talk about

260
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,820
them and basically the different places

261
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,279
they occur so in the service sub layer

262
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,380
information you've got application flow

263
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,579
identification information you might

264
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:36,880
have sequence number you might have a

265
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:40,029
the S label for the service you may have

266
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,930
packet reputation replication functions

267
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,220
PRF whether it's used or not and

268
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:50,079
associating forwarding and sub-layer

269
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,430
information for receiving traffic on the

270
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,019
service sub layer you've got the

271
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,510
Associated forwarding sub layer

272
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:58,720
information the service label for the

273
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,870
research service packet elimination or

274
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:08,079
ordering functions if they're provided

275
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:10,779
and sequence number in service I

276
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,819
aggregation the S labels after those

277
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,589
letter to be carried over each

278
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,800
aggregated service if you have

279
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,699
aggregation the a label associated with

280
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,109
each aggregated service our other

281
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:26,439
service label information summarized

282
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,000
above in the forwarding sub layer you've

283
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,380
got the outgoing F label stack and

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,910
traffic parameters associated with a

285
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,709
specific label on the stack you've got

286
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,469
the outgoing interface in the next hawk

287
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:44,589
for unicast traffic and any sub networks

288
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:47,980
specific parameters on the receiving

289
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:50,019
side you got the incoming interface the

290
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,160
incoming forwarding label stack to be

291
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:57,670
popped and incoming flows love sub layer

292
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,769
and it the the note at the bottom just

293
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,260
says the required information depends on

294
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:04,810
the type of node so this is the set of

295
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:11,980
capabilities you may use a subset of

296
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:13,540
that so now the MPLS and IP were the two

297
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,220
main things and now we're looking at

298
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,769
some of the

299
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,300
the building rocks capabilities where

300
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:23,319
you've got one type of service over

301
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,240
another so for IP over MPLS there's a

302
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:28,120
data plane direct document and it

303
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:34,589
specifies considerations for carrying IP

304
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:36,550
over MPLS it looks at the the flow I get

305
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:40,839
identification and the traffic treat

306
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:42,099
treatment and any and then then we'll

307
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,459
get to the management control

308
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,490
information so summary on the right-hand

309
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:51,160
side you've got the the diagram here is

310
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,999
showing the IP service that's going over

311
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:59,350
top of the MPLS dead net and that could

312
00:16:54,999 --> 00:17:01,800
be a IP dead net service going over the

313
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:06,069
MPLS system and then we've got the

314
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,819
representation of the various label

315
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,799
stacks and sub layer information that

316
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,408
you could have for the application flow

317
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,530
you've got the application flow and then

318
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,720
if you're going across MPLS and then the

319
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:24,599
link sudden a subnet nares that you can

320
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:30,630
go across l2 x sensitive networking or

321
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:30,629
UDP depending upon the system

322
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,790
so just the summary of the IP over MPLS

323
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,670
information here at the ingress node

324
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:49,409
each MPLS flow is identified using the

325
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:51,540
IP flowing information and includes the

326
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,150
wild cards port ranges in the ability to

327
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:58,290
ignore specific IP fields as we saw

328
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,820
before the dead-end MPLS service that

329
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,649
has be used to send the matching IP

330
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,740
traffic includes both service and

331
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:08,580
traffic delivery information at the MPLS

332
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:11,130
egress node I think there's a typo in

333
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,860
here the s label basically that's

334
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:20,190
associated with the MPLS basically the

335
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:22,620
IP IP is encapsulated traffic is what

336
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,450
we're looking at that's straight out of

337
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,679
the document and we need to fix that in

338
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:36,630
the document for each s label how the

339
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:39,180
receive traffic is to be handled the

340
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,780
next document we're looking at is MPLS

341
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:45,990
over UDP IP so the reverse of the last

342
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:49,080
case case and a little bit in this case

343
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:52,830
we've got specific MPLS deterministic

344
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,629
networking data playing operation over

345
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,879
an IP network so in cases where you

346
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:03,180
don't have MPLS and then you can operate

347
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:08,880
it over IP and we've got the management

348
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:13,320
and control information for that so for

349
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,510
that one we've got the label information

350
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,320
the service label or the forwarding

351
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:22,080
label to be mapped to the IP UDP flow

352
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,780
the ipv4 and ipv6 source address

353
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,580
information the destination address

354
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:32,639
information the service and the IPC ipv6

355
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:36,649
traffic class fields on the UDP source

356
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,650
port a UDP destination port

357
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,530
as I mentioned before these documents

358
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,140
are the TSN related cases are not

359
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:52,000
complete yet but there are three drafts

360
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:56,620
that are intended to be worked on for

361
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,520
the next session the next meeting so

362
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:03,790
that's debt net IP over TSN and then

363
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:11,080
we've got debt net MPLS over TSN and

364
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:14,320
then we've got TSN or Ethernet VPN over

365
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,000
MPLS we created the dress during the

366
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,250
split because there was material in them

367
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,280
but there's further work needed and any

368
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:26,020
kind of contributions are welcome so

369
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,899
what we're looking for is to get a last

370
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,300
call on these five documents the

371
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:40,330
framework the IP document the MPLS

372
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:43,480
document and the IP or MPLS document and

373
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:46,030
the MPLS and MPLS over UDP documents and

374
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,870
at this point I think we'll go back to

375
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:52,360
slide five one one comment here we are

376
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,909
in an unusual situation and one we

377
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,760
generally like to avoid where we have

378
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:01,900
chairs contributing to the drafts to

379
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,230
manage that we have identified and we've

380
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,450
appreciated that Ethan our secretary is

381
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,780
going to be Shepherd for these documents

382
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:14,290
so we want to recognize that we are in

383
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:18,520
this unusual situation and also tell you

384
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:20,920
how we're handle yet yes thank you

385
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,040
yes Thank You Ethan welcome your trial

386
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,590
by fire let's go back to slide four

387
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,700
actually because I have I had I sent a

388
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,409
note to those name please

389
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,380
it's like a tee blaq so something no to

390
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:35,200
list with three transport determines the

391
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,570
IP draft first one which is bought into

392
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,350
with yep forgot to fix that one will fix

393
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:44,100
let's go deal with the other two so on

394
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,050
this side for identification six tuple

395
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,899
short summary is that while you can

396
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,129
usually while you identify the flow with

397
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,070
the

398
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,860
six people the 5-tuple substance each

399
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,200
tuple has to be unique with respect to

400
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,070
all other five tuple flows on the

401
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,430
network and I'm easy I'm easy writing

402
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:08,220
text for that okay so I I think there's

403
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:10,650
a subtlety there that the rest of us are

404
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,300
not following okay so I think you know

405
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,090
the short answer is yeah that seems

406
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,200
obvious so I don't think you would be

407
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:21,990
coming to the mic to say something

408
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:24,710
obvious okay so explain so apologies

409
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,630
those of us who spend time in transport

410
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,700
don't count you have to fly them asleep

411
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:38,340
so a five tuple is IP source and

412
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:41,340
destination addresses a the protocol you

413
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,310
use you usually have at layer 4 and 2

414
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,500
and 2 for set protocol that's the five

415
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:49,310
people six tuple adds a dscp

416
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,130
what's going on here is the diffserv

417
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:55,800
architecture says you use DSC piece to

418
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,190
mark flows you don't use DHCP so

419
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:04,110
subdivide a flow into sub flows and so

420
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:06,510
what that implies for for the the IP

421
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,250
draft is it's fine cater six people

422
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,410
identify the flow in fact there that I

423
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,120
can think of some good implementation

424
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:16,020
reasons to want the dscp

425
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,850
to be spected but the five triples got

426
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,040
to be unique because you're building on

427
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,730
diffserv and diffserv says the flow is

428
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,370
five tuple i think it'll be important to

429
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:29,310
in this text that you're proposing to

430
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,770
capture what the implication is that you

431
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:36,649
see that of that uniqueness okay there

432
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:39,750
there are work the for two implications

433
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,720
one which is easy and I'll do the hard

434
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,210
one later the easy implication is there

435
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,780
are a few places and diffserv where you

436
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:51,660
can mark a flow with more than one dscp

437
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,060
the decision identify flow by six tuple

438
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,280
says debt and it can't do that no big

439
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,740
deal that's a that's a design decision

440
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,560
it's more than time to make we're going

441
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,520
to change the flow identification to

442
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,300
rather than be a mask to be a list

443
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,670
and if it's a list it allows for that

444
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,500
not when there's texting the IP draft

445
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:15,280
that says a six tuple uniquely

446
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,130
identifies the flow . it's six to full

447
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,960
including masks and other things that

448
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,880
are shown on there in which case we hope

449
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,890
this game is interesting - in intro

450
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,900
interesting text or item I was wearing

451
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:29,890
Testament six with to be me the other

452
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,930
point is that because a debt NetFlow is

453
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,350
also a flow that I paint

454
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:38,320
diffserv expect to be a flow you've got

455
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,510
to be able to outside a bit knit context

456
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,750
use that five triples a handle on the

457
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,150
flow and therefore it can't be the case

458
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:50,710
that this five tuple source destination

459
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:54,670
protocol two ports with an EF dscp is

460
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:57,100
one flow and with a and and with a CS

461
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,840
one DHCP is is a different flow if

462
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,179
you've chosen you've chosen Orkut with

463
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,919
EF you've chosen mark with EF you won't

464
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,540
know the flow change for change one of

465
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,310
the ports or something like what what is

466
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,480
a different flow mean to you are you

467
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,310
talking about from an application

468
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,410
standpoint or from a network standpoint

469
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,080
network sampling a particular difference

470
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:18,970
of architecture what's the implication

471
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,710
of that David what's the implication of

472
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,330
what does it mean to be a different flow

473
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,890
I mean if you're saying different flow

474
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,250
from an application perspective means

475
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:30,370
you know I have a voice you know voice

476
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,570
on voice versus video and we're

477
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,590
combining it and the only difference is

478
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:38,230
dscp that's clearly forbidden I get that

479
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,730
from a network standpoint if it's gonna

480
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,260
receive a different traffic treatment

481
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,340
that's a different flow I mean again so

482
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,170
that's what this or does is give a

483
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,939
different traffic treatment but diffserv

484
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,060
gives just different traffic treatments

485
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,220
we don't subject we we don't we don't

486
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:58,419
subject we try not to subdivide five

487
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:01,870
tools I'm not sure maybe again it'd be

488
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,820
very important to capture if there's

489
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,040
what restrictions there are on the

490
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,840
network equipment based on that

491
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,730
statement I think I think we're okay

492
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,129
with the statement particularly from the

493
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,350
context of how it impacts applications

494
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,210
because certainly that's a no-brainer

495
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,449
right I mean no one's gonna argue about

496
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,309
that one no one's going to miss

497
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,049
or that one but in terms of actual

498
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:23,059
network equipment what behavior they

499
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:25,429
have to do differently that's what we

500
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,870
have to make sure we cover I think the

501
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:28,399
best thing to this point let's take it

502
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,168
offline because sounds like I'm working

503
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:31,549
from text it's about to get changed let

504
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,279
me fit let's take it offline field of

505
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:38,379
new Texas and then work it and then then

506
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:41,059
then then work the issue from there

507
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,769
microphone please and name Stuart Bryant

508
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:48,230
I'm still curious as to how the five

509
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:50,059
couple doesn't uniquely define a flow

510
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,220
assuming we exclude Nats

511
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:56,418
I don't understand they are a unique

512
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,970
description of a flow you Ironbound

513
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:02,299
agreement and I think I am - I'm just

514
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:05,539
confused you know the problem is there's

515
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:07,940
some text in the draft that isn't as it

516
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:10,039
isn't as preciseness points ought to be

517
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,169
and the best bet here is let's see what

518
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:14,210
happens when we edit that that lis

519
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:20,120
describes gets made and I'll try to

520
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:30,830
figure it out from there let's see the

521
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:33,649
text and norm fin I

522
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,418
I assume it's okay in a flow I've got a

523
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:38,209
flow with different deists if I've got a

524
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:41,980
five couple and I've got different DSC

525
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:47,120
fees that the packets get out of order

526
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:49,309
because that depends on the dscp it's

527
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,268
true unless otherwise specified and

528
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:56,269
those are very important otherwise

529
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:58,669
specified called AF oh because because I

530
00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:01,630
think our intention here is that when

531
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:03,919
identifying the flow we're talking about

532
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,330
in some of the drafts we're talking

533
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,350
about identifying the flow because

534
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,120
different flows may have to go into

535
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,350
different cues for example in order to

536
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,479
get the quality of service we want and

537
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:20,840
that when deciding which cue a flow goes

538
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:24,470
into the dscp is very important deciding

539
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:27,459
which cue a packet goes into the dscp is

540
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,460
an important distinction

541
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:36,510
correct and hence if the if when the

542
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,699
DHCP is picking off the queue and you

543
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,980
don't want Gordon within the flow don't

544
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,600
use DSC piece in that flow the pickoff

545
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,720
different queues and calls reordering is

546
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,159
the punchline okay I think I think I

547
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,260
think we mean but but actually if that's

548
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,210
the text you want to put in as an

549
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,190
implication I think everyone will

550
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,480
violently agree yeah I just I just need

551
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,460
to see okay I think we're good

552
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:06,370
did you one more Stewart oh you're

553
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:08,049
going to the same a microphone please if

554
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,000
you're gonna have a conversation I'm

555
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:11,379
just trying to get my head round I know

556
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I've been working on this I'm trying my

557
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,440
head down when you actually want

558
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,990
different dscp s in the essentially the

559
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,820
same UDP port because it's going to the

560
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:26,230
same service on the same application

561
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,939
generally we don't worry about the

562
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,940
applications here that's for someone

563
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,040
else to worry about above us so we're

564
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,760
providing tools that no no no that I

565
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,230
think we should probably put some

566
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,919
clarification because I'm trying to

567
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,350
figure out why you do it let's see I

568
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:45,210
think the best thing I can probably do

569
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:48,490
here tremors a short discussion is

570
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:51,130
probably to point you over at over

571
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,990
towards web RTC which is trying to do an

572
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:58,240
or for a lot of multiplex and have an

573
00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:01,150
awful lot of stuff i but it but in

574
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,710
general in general this is a doctor it

575
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,410
hurts when I do that don't do that

576
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,760
discussion we simply need me me need to

577
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:10,630
find a precise words to say don't do

578
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,490
that if we are going to have this

579
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,530
distinction it'd be really handy if

580
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,540
someone would provide an example because

581
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,129
having thought about it now I'm confused

582
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,080
I'm sure some of our readers we can it

583
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,320
is part of the current internet

584
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,240
architecture that that's supported so

585
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,370
we're not going to revisit the internet

586
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,530
architecture in this working group no so

587
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:33,070
the internet architecture allows this

588
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:36,960
case ok we don't see any reason to

589
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:39,549
disallow this case

590
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,020
sorry the working group has never

591
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:43,580
suggested disallowing this case before

592
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,200
if we think we should be disallowing

593
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,090
part of what is supporting the internet

594
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,860
architecture number one we got to be

595
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,090
really sure that we were doing that

596
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,290
we're gonna change the internet

597
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:56,750
architecture and number two is will have

598
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:59,300
to reach consensus on that right so we

599
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:02,750
should go back I mean it it would be

600
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:05,030
useful for many people I think we just

601
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,180
crystallized an example of a case we

602
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,320
want to do this or we call out that that

603
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,670
actually know is you know I think you

604
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,200
should go read about diffserv because

605
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,390
this serve talks a lot about this so

606
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,660
Stuart the simple case you might be

607
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,670
looking at is diffserv defines a piece

608
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,430
of functionality the debt net probably

609
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:25,070
isn't interested in it's called a F it's

610
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:30,080
called a shrewd forwarding inside an AF

611
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:33,740
class any of class the AF 3 has 3 DCPS

612
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,980
in increasing order in in order of drop

613
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:39,230
precedence dead net can't drop traffic

614
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,780
there for a picnic wants to use a of 3 a

615
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,500
of 31 suffices don't touch the other two

616
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,500
doesn't make any difference

617
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,860
AHA I see Stewart's head nodding

618
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,740
vertically so at least an example is me

619
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,209
communicated I think we need something

620
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,160
around that in the text because I am

621
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:02,900
sure that the the other readers will we

622
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,240
will find it useful essential writing

623
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,430
some text yeah I sent it for that one

624
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,940
moment when when I hit Send on the email

625
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:15,500
okay let me okay now now now I don't let

626
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:19,730
me go through one I'm confused about so

627
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:22,850
what is the what is the purpose of the

628
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,610
management and control information where

629
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:28,820
I'm trying to figure out here is what to

630
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:30,740
do with the v4 type of what do you about

631
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:36,480
the v4 type of service in v6 traffic

632
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:39,900
class fields so what were like

633
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,870
what is the purpose information on this

634
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,970
slide used for that well this slide is

635
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,739
basically saying these are the fields

636
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,540
that you can choose to identify the

637
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:55,260
traffic it doesn't have to be all of

638
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:57,149
them at once okay if this is okay I'm

639
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,680
also trying to split it here and ask

640
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,390
what the heck is it what do you mean by

641
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,470
identify that's between our productive

642
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,780
question to ask

643
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:08,610
traffic classification over try to

644
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:11,070
classification your the type of service

645
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:14,250
in v6 credit class fields then need to

646
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:16,740
be split because the ECM field is in

647
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:19,380
there thou shalt not use the ECM field

648
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,830
to identify traffic that's the easy one

649
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:25,800
and then the dscp is the other six bits

650
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:28,379
in those two fields you can use DHCP and

651
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,730
you are using DHCP to identify - to

652
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:36,450
identify and classify traffic that's

653
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:38,490
fine yeah I think that's some clarifying

654
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,240
text we were identified we got a we have

655
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,340
to fix that

656
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,730
I believe it's broken out in the

657
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,439
document the the field is broken out

658
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,390
it's good see this this was copy of the

659
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,480
document it's gonna have to be written

660
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:56,610
to split the type of surging traffic

661
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,770
class fields into dscp DCN fields and

662
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,090
the bitmask hits the bitbucket and it

663
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,620
sounds like what I need to do is I need

664
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,419
to go tape I just said and write and

665
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,310
longer email messages about what has to

666
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,470
change what needs to change here and why

667
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,750
now I understand that the purpose of

668
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,909
this is try to classification which to

669
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,850
me means this is you these these the

670
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,830
fields that you can use in a filter to

671
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,299
carve out the very small chunk of

672
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,779
traffic that has to go through the debt

673
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:27,890
net forwarding plane in in the node yeah

674
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,890
please propose text will do thank you

675
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,050
any other comments I think I'm done

676
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:02,100
okay so this is an update on the flow

677
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:06,480
information draft so what happened to

678
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:09,150
this draft since the previous IDF the

679
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,859
last ITF representation was given on

680
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:18,450
what changes we see to be made we see as

681
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:21,359
authors contributors and actually we

682
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:25,049
implemented those changes so this new

683
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:30,480
version four is an implementation of the

684
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:34,560
ITF 104 presentation as contribution to

685
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,090
the group from the authors and I keep

686
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,119
saying and highlighting the please

687
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,910
review and comment and charge I mean so

688
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,720
this is just a contribution from the

689
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:48,440
authors to capture the changes needed so

690
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,830
it implies actually a major rewrite or

691
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,859
reorganization compared to the previous

692
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:59,490
version of the draft the figure you see

693
00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:06,600
on the screen is taken from the MPLS

694
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:09,060
data pane draft and three components are

695
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:14,390
highlighted there are the applications

696
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:18,900
and one directional flows on the screen

697
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:23,069
that is the the blue one on top which is

698
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,340
the application of flow and there is a

699
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:28,380
gray one that not flow which goes

700
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,650
through the definite service layer so

701
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:36,510
these are the the terms I will be

702
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:39,560
referring back to in a minute before

703
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:44,960
that what is the scope of this document

704
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:49,410
the two top bullets under the black ones

705
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:53,130
are the scope so to provide and describe

706
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:55,250
that not flow information model describe

707
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,990
the characteristics of that not flows

708
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:00,450
requirements attributes that are needed

709
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:03,779
to handle the data flows in the Debnath

710
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:07,710
network as well to provide a service

711
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,029
information model like describing what

712
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,949
service

713
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:14,130
at night service that not Network

714
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:16,979
provides to us that NetFlow and the

715
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:20,130
third third one is out of scope for this

716
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:22,799
document but that's definitely part of

717
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:26,189
the full picture that's why it is here

718
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:29,999
that's the configuration data model and

719
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:34,908
that's scope of the yank documents you

720
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:39,629
will hear about after me in this session

721
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:41,579
just turn around you summary what you

722
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:45,089
see on the left-hand side is coming from

723
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:47,369
the architecture and on the right hand

724
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:50,788
side we proposed to use some new terms

725
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:54,329
in the document to be able to refer to

726
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:57,630
to these items to make easier the

727
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:59,009
description so an application flow let's

728
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,199
talking talk about the left hand side

729
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:05,989
the architecture an application flow

730
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:10,259
from data perspective is the data the

731
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:14,969
payload carried over that net service or

732
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:18,239
in a data flow and a definite flow is

733
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:22,589
actually an application for plus the

734
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:25,919
dead net encapsulations including MPLS

735
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:28,828
if it is MPLS or IP or or sequence

736
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:32,339
numbers and so on so forth so what is

737
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:35,819
specified by that net as a needed to

738
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:38,189
provide the deadness services I would

739
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:43,919
like to highlight these two notes in the

740
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:46,499
bottom that in some of the cases the up

741
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:49,618
flow and the dotnet flow may look like

742
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:52,799
the very same on the wire this you find

743
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:56,640
this in the in the IP data plane draft

744
00:38:52,799 --> 00:39:00,749
as well that the IP application flow

745
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,400
headers remain and just used in by the

746
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:04,379
debt net notes between the death and

747
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,559
domain there may be no further

748
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,939
encapsulation added the second note

749
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:14,699
points on one way the aggregation can be

750
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:18,239
done and if we do an aggregation

751
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:21,390
actually aggregating that multiple

752
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:25,619
Debnath flows into a single that net for

753
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:28,288
it can be viewed as that Naturals

754
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,569
being aggregated becoming up flows from

755
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:33,660
the perspective of the aggregate and

756
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:37,349
that not slow you will see more details

757
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:41,578
on this in the following slides new

758
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:46,650
terms that we proposed for the

759
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:48,569
description a source being the reference

760
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,940
point for the application flow the

761
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:54,200
originator of the originator application

762
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:56,880
of the data of the application flow

763
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:00,779
destination is still refers to an app

764
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,779
flow that's the termination point of the

765
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:06,150
app flow and the two bottom ones

766
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:10,019
definite English and that net egress

767
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:12,769
refer to the death net flow so these are

768
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:14,970
reference points the English one is the

769
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:16,979
starting point from in the Death Note

770
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:20,939
network perspective for the dead net

771
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:23,400
flow and the dead net aggress is the

772
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,369
termination point for the data domain

773
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,700
that that map network for that that net

774
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:34,410
flow so these terms are used in the

775
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:38,089
following and the three aspects three

776
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:41,299
groups captured in this document as

777
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:44,339
information elements or groups with us

778
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:46,859
the bottom two are the two that are

779
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:48,599
really the scope of the document the

780
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:51,839
deadness flow parameters and the

781
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,059
definite service parameters on top you

782
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,730
see the app app flow which is not the

783
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:59,220
core but we need to talk about it we

784
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,710
need to have an understanding in order

785
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:06,269
to be able to provide that net service

786
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:08,160
for enough flow so the net flow related

787
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:10,680
parameters describe did that have four

788
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,220
characteristics requirements and so on

789
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:17,368
and that met service related parameters

790
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,799
provide a description on on what the

791
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:22,890
service provides

792
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:25,079
towards the flows bit more in detail

793
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:27,410
actually this is a this is a single

794
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:32,190
slide summary of the whole document

795
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:34,920
currently so as I mentioned the core

796
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:38,490
part is the green and the blue

797
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,530
in the books titles with the title or

798
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:42,479
the name of the draft draft idea of that

799
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:46,710
not for information mother so that's the

800
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,590
core part and in - line in the red box

801
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:52,380
that is the up flow as I said we need to

802
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,280
have an understanding and in some cases

803
00:41:52,380 --> 00:42:00,030
actually that net flows become app flows

804
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,070
let's do a top-down or from left to

805
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,520
right in this case

806
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:07,950
so the an app flow has two kinds of

807
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,020
groups it has some characteristics

808
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:12,419
describing the flow and it has some

809
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,060
requirements as part of the

810
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,090
characteristics we propose to have a

811
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,970
flow ID which is only a management ID I

812
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:25,980
will pull out an example when it is

813
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:29,009
handy and we propose to have a flow type

814
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,320
to know what type of flow it is is it

815
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:34,620
internet for MPS or a type II flow

816
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,860
because it is useful and important at

817
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,810
the edge nodes when adding or removing

818
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,990
encapsulations

819
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:44,520
that is the flow specification part that

820
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:47,729
okay how do we describe the flows so

821
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,970
destination address labels alone IDs

822
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,380
whatsoever and there is the traffic

823
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,830
specification the traffic

824
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,800
characteristics of the flow itself the

825
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:01,880
packet interval packet size and my

826
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:05,280
maximum packet maximum number of packets

827
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,190
the floor endpoints belong to the flow

828
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,440
description and it's been there in

829
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:15,420
before in previous drafts as well the

830
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:18,270
flow rank that can be used to rank flows

831
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:21,180
even in case of a race or for scarce

832
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:23,520
resources for example and the flow

833
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,339
status is is it established supported or

834
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,150
there was some failure

835
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,410
as for requirements flows typically have

836
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:33,300
bandwidth requirements packet delay

837
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:36,589
recover or requirements packet delivery

838
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:40,760
requirements and loss requirements and

839
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:44,340
we suggested to have a parameter called

840
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,740
bit irrational to indicate whether

841
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,620
actually so all of the flows are

842
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,439
basically you

843
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:53,310
directional but the flow may have a

844
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,950
power affair in the other direction and

845
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:59,020
in some cases actually you may want to

846
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,509
have them routed congruent or something

847
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,270
like that and in this case it is good to

848
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:06,430
know if these two floors belong together

849
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:09,310
and this is one of the examples when

850
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:11,080
this management flow idea becomes handy

851
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:14,680
so it's only for the management purposes

852
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:18,790
to know that for example two flows

853
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:23,049
should be corroded not a big surprise

854
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:26,080
that the rapid flow parameters in the

855
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,760
green box are very similar to the AB

856
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,520
flow parameters for the reasons I

857
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,970
mentioned for example data flow may

858
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:37,360
become a net flow so data flow has

859
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:40,750
characteristics and requirements and as

860
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,480
part of the characteristics the flow ID

861
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:46,240
for management purposes the payload type

862
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,260
and then here comes some new parameter

863
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,419
specific to that now

864
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:55,050
so we have two data plane solutions MPLS

865
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:58,270
and IP okay what is this flow format and

866
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,850
the flow specification it can be labels

867
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:03,520
like the s label or a stack of FAA

868
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:07,060
flavors in case of MPLS data plane or a

869
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,580
six topper if we use IP data plan for

870
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,580
that net the traffic specification is

871
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:14,710
very similar to a net flow it has the

872
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:17,560
interval a packet size and the maximum

873
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:21,010
number of packets and as for the

874
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:24,790
endpoints for a data flow these are the

875
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:28,360
ingress or egress endpoints we propose

876
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:32,580
to introduce and flow rank is similar

877
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:35,140
again if rank can be very useful when

878
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,390
doing resource allocation and not having

879
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:40,980
enough resources if you have to make a

880
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:44,410
decision which flow gets the resources

881
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:46,750
flow status like is it was it successful

882
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:50,649
the flow establishment or not for

883
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:53,830
example and as part of the requirements

884
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:56,530
a data flow can have minimum bandwidth

885
00:45:53,830 --> 00:46:01,069
requirement maximum latency maximum

886
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:04,160
latency variation maximum loss maximum

887
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:06,860
consecutive loss tolerance how many

888
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,089
consecutive pep packets are tolerated to

889
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:12,440
be lost a maximum so during how many

890
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,960
number of packets can be miss ordered

891
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,330
and tolerated by the application

892
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,000
actually and again a similar parameter

893
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:23,450
is it does it does this so has a

894
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,750
corresponding flow in the other

895
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:30,890
direction in a sense that do we support

896
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:34,150
a be directional application the blue

897
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:36,890
box is the description of the service

898
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,870
and this is a little bit different

899
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:42,259
compared to the flow because the flow is

900
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:45,200
coming with requirements characteristics

901
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:48,170
and in the.net Network we establish

902
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,379
services to support these flows which

903
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:54,950
has correlated but slightly different

904
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:58,190
parameters we suggest to have an idea

905
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:00,290
for that service as well service

906
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,650
delivery type analogous to the previous

907
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:07,460
one it's either eaten at MPLS or an IP

908
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:09,710
that not service and another proposal to

909
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:12,740
distinguish point to point and point to

910
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:16,640
multi-point that net service types

911
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:18,790
note that multi-point to multi-point can

912
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:23,299
be constructed from point to multi-point

913
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:25,670
services in which case this be

914
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:29,960
directional becomes handy again to

915
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:31,790
indicate their cover correlated the

916
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,710
service rank is similar rank as I

917
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:39,920
explained explained before and here

918
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:41,840
comes a difference of a service actually

919
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,250
it provides the delivery profile so this

920
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,830
is what the service provides you

921
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:50,800
delivers for you gives you a bandwidth

922
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:53,750
latency latency variation and so on

923
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,120
there is the service between actuality I

924
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:59,780
already touched upon and the service

925
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:03,259
status similarly like is it up and

926
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:12,710
running or is there any issue on either

927
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:14,779
end point question from highway of our

928
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:18,049
brief question and what is the relation

929
00:48:14,779 --> 00:48:22,789
between the parameter in the green box

930
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:26,029
the tan net flow format and the

931
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:29,089
parameter in the sorry the in a green

932
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:31,339
box it it is called as a then add a flow

933
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:34,308
format in the blue box it is called a

934
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:37,819
telnet service delivery type what is

935
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:40,039
about these two parameters so the

936
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:42,769
relationship is rather in the green box

937
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:47,569
that is the data payload type that is

938
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:50,749
related to the service level type so

939
00:48:47,569 --> 00:48:53,089
what is is it like when you look at the

940
00:48:50,749 --> 00:48:55,038
debt nut service is it like a layer 2

941
00:48:53,089 --> 00:49:00,319
service that provided by that net

942
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:08,630
service that is for in the green box a

943
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:11,329
layer 2 eaten at I can understand the

944
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:15,109
payload type is different right yeah but

945
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:18,339
the flow format and the delivery type I

946
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:23,259
think it should be the same right they

947
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:28,279
so the flow format means is it an MPLS

948
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:30,469
that not the implementation or an IP and

949
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:33,949
you saw that in the data plane that I

950
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:36,289
make mixtures like you can have MPLS

951
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:39,709
over IP and so on so in the same network

952
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:43,239
actually you may have the same very same

953
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:47,509
packet Network may provide both type of

954
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:48,439
data players in some form that not MPLS

955
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:51,169
oh definitely

956
00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:54,828
ok and it's good to know which one it is

957
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:57,169
that's the idea behind ok so the result

958
00:49:54,829 --> 00:50:02,900
is that the concluding does it can be

959
00:49:57,169 --> 00:50:05,089
different yes ok yes thank you ok two

960
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:08,900
slides left I think so this is about

961
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:11,409
mapping of these these flows are in

962
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:14,029
services there is a many to one mapping

963
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:16,279
when it comes to a close to that

964
00:50:14,029 --> 00:50:18,739
naturally mapping so multiple up flows

965
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:21,109
can be supported by that not so multiple

966
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:24,190
AB AB flows can be mapped to a single

967
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:27,670
that that flow and

968
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:29,619
coming back to the aggregation one way

969
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:32,589
of aggregation or one way of looking at

970
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:35,859
that that aggregation is when that not

971
00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:39,819
flow to be aggregated into one becomes

972
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:44,348
an up flow and from the perspective of

973
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:46,538
the aggregate that that flow and the

974
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:50,039
mapping of that not flows to that net

975
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:54,010
service is also a many to one mapping

976
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:57,130
single debt net service the one may

977
00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:00,579
support multiple that not flows and you

978
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:03,700
see also the red items the multiple app

979
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:08,500
flows so this is how we see the mapping

980
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:10,270
and actually so this is as I said this

981
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,980
was a contribution from the authors we

982
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:14,980
really would like to have working group

983
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:22,990
review and comments other missing

984
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:25,440
parameters elaborated text usual working

985
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,439
at work

986
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:35,500
other comments questions so what's left

987
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:37,569
to do before last call so we really

988
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,880
would like to get feedback because this

989
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:42,700
is authors you this is Otto's initial

990
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,500
take on taking into account what

991
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:48,058
happened to the architecture what

992
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:50,950
happened to the beta playing so easily

993
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:52,390
do you think you've captured everything

994
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:54,819
that's happened in the other documents

995
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:57,190
the dead find documents we did our best

996
00:51:54,819 --> 00:52:02,609
but this was a first shot from our side

997
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:05,140
as well so our view is yes so getting

998
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:07,900
the additional reading by the working

999
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:10,930
group now is the time is definitely it

1000
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,839
sounds to wait until we resolve

1001
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:16,750
everything on the first set of documents

1002
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:21,578
before last calling this one yes that

1003
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:24,849
said do you think it would be beneficial

1004
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:29,130
or a negative to last call it at the

1005
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:32,109
same time as the data pine documents I

1006
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:36,069
haven't gone that far I'm not sure I

1007
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:38,000
mean I don't know I mean it has been

1008
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,070
several documents

1009
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,750
trade-off fear the trade-off here is is

1010
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:45,020
we might end up with a lot of reading

1011
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:47,840
change oh no no a lot of reading by the

1012
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,780
working group the benefit is is people

1013
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:54,380
will read it as a set and get the full

1014
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:57,830
picture so I can see it both ways

1015
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,870
I actually I personally well right now I

1016
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,700
don't have a strong opinion this will be

1017
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:04,910
there will be two different Shepherds

1018
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:06,649
here so or there could be two different

1019
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:11,810
Shepherds here you knows I'm not an

1020
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:13,970
author on this so we have some we don't

1021
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,500
well I'm not sure that matters actually

1022
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:18,709
never mind that doesn't matter let's

1023
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:43,550
think about it for okay thank you thank

1024
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:46,700
you good afternoon everyone this is

1025
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:49,990
issue soon and I will introduce our work

1026
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:54,109
about the tenant configuration yamoto

1027
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:57,259
in this version we end a new order Yun

1028
00:53:54,110 --> 00:54:00,620
Chao and he contributes a lot for this

1029
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:04,670
work thank you for his contribution and

1030
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:06,920
basically after I Kiev well for we

1031
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:09,680
received some comments from the working

1032
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:12,230
group and basically the requirement is

1033
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,060
that let the make the tenant

1034
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,280
configuration your model fitting in the

1035
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:19,520
design of and that architecture and the

1036
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,980
data plan solution so after the idea

1037
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,710
valve for the others have a lot of

1038
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:29,660
discussions and we do a lot of work to

1039
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:33,080
satisfy the requirement and so this lies

1040
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:36,379
is the introduction of our work and

1041
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,360
basically the parameters defined in the

1042
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:44,720
young model are similar to the previous

1043
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:48,640
version and the structure is changed so

1044
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:51,830
here is the the result of our new work

1045
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,930
basically we define four

1046
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,910
that's not a configuration instance the

1047
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:58,339
first is the application flow instance

1048
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,830
the service sub leer instance forwarding

1049
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:04,490
sub their instance and some Network

1050
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:07,580
instance we can see in the left picture

1051
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:10,879
this is the DES net data plan protocol

1052
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:16,640
static defined in the architecture draft

1053
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:20,240
and the right picture is is the picture

1054
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:22,460
shows that how we use the test net

1055
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,520
configuration instance we define in this

1056
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:28,280
draft to configure the net discipline

1057
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,150
protocol stack we can see that it can

1058
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:35,600
match with each other and here is the

1059
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:38,360
overview of the whole picture of the

1060
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,509
configuration your model basically as I

1061
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:45,950
have just introduced there are four

1062
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:50,450
classic classes of instance and for each

1063
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:53,180
instance we have at least inside each

1064
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:55,939
instance the the structure is similar we

1065
00:55:53,180 --> 00:56:00,169
have a name the operation the in segment

1066
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:03,290
and all segment here is the parameters

1067
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:05,690
for each instance in application float

1068
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:08,590
operations include sequence number

1069
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:11,600
generation and the in segment is the

1070
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:13,610
application flow identification it can

1071
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:16,490
be layer three application floor or

1072
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:19,220
layer two application flow and it can

1073
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:22,899
also be a tunnel flow and the assignment

1074
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:25,100
is a pointer to a lower sub layer

1075
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,650
instance than a serviceable their

1076
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:29,930
instance here is a question to be

1077
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,450
discussed whether the sequence number

1078
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:35,480
generation of this operation should be

1079
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:38,810
defined in the application flow instance

1080
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:41,180
because when we do the flow aggregation

1081
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:45,340
the the sequence number generation may

1082
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:48,680
be also required so maybe it can also

1083
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:51,800
another choices to define this operation

1084
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:54,710
in the service sub layer instance here

1085
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,660
is the tree of the llamado and here is

1086
00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:00,260
the service of lyric instance the

1087
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:03,200
operation have two classes the first one

1088
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:05,180
is the service operation including

1089
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,899
service initiation

1090
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:12,230
and relate and also it includes the

1091
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:14,800
Service protection operation the

1092
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:17,319
replication elimination ordering and the

1093
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,119
combination of these operations the

1094
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:22,250
instrument is done a flaw identification

1095
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:24,650
and the assignment is the attend a

1096
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:27,260
service of layer encapsulation and also

1097
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,880
a pointer to the lower sub layer

1098
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,640
instance the for wordings of their

1099
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,819
instance and here is the sub layer

1100
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,680
instance tree and also the for wordings

1101
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:39,410
of their instance the operation is the

1102
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:41,930
resource allocation the parameters for

1103
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:44,200
this part is the traffic specification

1104
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:46,220
and the instrument is forwarding added

1105
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,960
identification and awesome and is the

1106
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,540
forwarding sub layer encapsulation and

1107
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,980
also a pointer to the sub network

1108
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:57,859
instance which is not included in the

1109
00:57:53,980 --> 00:58:03,760
this version of the traffic yet here is

1110
00:57:57,859 --> 00:58:07,220
the tree actually we don't receive very

1111
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:11,599
or a lot of comments from the mailing

1112
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:15,410
list here here is the one of them from

1113
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:18,500
Lu application flow or then a service

1114
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:22,220
proxy this discussion is about the name

1115
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:24,680
of the we think it's and perhaps it can

1116
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:28,279
be a new sub layer for that that's not

1117
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:31,308
but I think from the new or from the

1118
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:34,520
chairs of he need it is just the

1119
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:36,319
application flow and so we keep it the

1120
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,900
name in the act

1121
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:42,470
architecture draft and so we call it

1122
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:45,170
application flow instance finally and we

1123
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:48,410
also our receive comments from David

1124
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:51,950
black and yes about the pig mask I think

1125
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:55,460
we have a discussion about that in the

1126
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:59,629
previous slides so previous presentation

1127
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:06,180
so I won't repeat the discussion oh DVDs

1128
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:07,859
come you again David

1129
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,269
instead back welcome like to say that I

1130
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:10,890
made you something productive as opposed

1131
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:13,169
to the long discussion I caused the last

1132
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:15,480
draft I've just sent to the list the two

1133
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:17,099
changes the IP data plane draft that

1134
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,609
will take out the bitmask

1135
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:22,079
and take out ECM for identification and

1136
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:23,308
so once those changes are made

1137
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,230
everything else should everything else

1138
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:29,730
should be reformed a place by following

1139
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:32,579
that that updated draft okay after the

1140
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:35,430
data plan problem is fixed I think the

1141
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:37,349
young model is following yeah David

1142
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:39,660
thank you for the contribution by the

1143
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:41,789
way there is a github repo and we accept

1144
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,009
full requests in this working group so

1145
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:46,410
anyone in the working group is welcome

1146
00:59:44,009 --> 00:59:50,420
to not only review but submit their own

1147
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:53,069
proposed changes that are specific

1148
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:56,400
actually I I want to end one more

1149
00:59:53,069 --> 01:00:01,349
comment for that discussion I think what

1150
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:04,289
is makest make it so difficult to to to

1151
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:06,749
figure this out perhaps it is because it

1152
01:00:04,289 --> 01:00:09,930
is not clear what is the relationship

1153
01:00:06,749 --> 01:00:12,058
between the traditional diffserv with

1154
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:14,308
the than that

1155
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:15,839
so if we can figure out what is the

1156
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:19,079
relationship between the current

1157
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:22,380
diffserv service and the DES not perhaps

1158
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:26,130
it is easy to see how to use the SCP

1159
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:30,059
value internet yes another discussion

1160
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:31,440
and continue the presentation what is

1161
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,190
the next photo at the configuration

1162
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:38,400
Yamoto

1163
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:40,470
I think this time the structure is can

1164
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:44,130
can satisfy the requirement from the

1165
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:48,839
working group so maybe this time the

1166
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:52,049
structure can be stable and afterwards

1167
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:55,589
more detailed designs can be ended to

1168
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:57,930
this structure including the aggregation

1169
01:00:55,589 --> 01:01:00,569
case including some unsolved issues

1170
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:05,368
mentioning in the slides also the sub

1171
01:01:00,569 --> 01:01:09,420
Network and please review the draft and

1172
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:12,269
give comments or just enjoy our work and

1173
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,210
also weekly discussion may be necessary

1174
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:19,109
for general configuration llamado just

1175
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:20,210
like what data plan draft a task because

1176
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:23,310
it will

1177
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:27,180
contribute to drop the to go along with

1178
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:31,740
other drops yeah whatever the author's

1179
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:33,540
feels the right tempo we can as the

1180
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:36,000
working group we can make sure that the

1181
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:41,820
working group WebEx is available to you

1182
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:44,340
and and for everyone okay so that's all

1183
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:50,780
that's our work about that then and

1184
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:53,190
copyright in your model so it in order

1185
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,390
I'm basically asking the same question

1186
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:56,670
that I asked you on OSHA about what do

1187
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:59,250
you need to get to last call it sounds

1188
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:03,450
like it's to wait to the other documents

1189
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:06,000
are complete and then update as

1190
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:10,020
necessary to align but you think the

1191
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,420
major structural pieces are there yes

1192
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:17,430
but I think the problem is the sub

1193
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:19,890
network is still yeah I think I had I

1194
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:21,720
made this comment on the list or perhaps

1195
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:23,970
at the last IETF privately I can't

1196
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:28,080
remember which I think we have to have a

1197
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:30,270
framework that allows augmentation for

1198
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,400
specific technologies in the future and

1199
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:34,320
as long as we have a that type of

1200
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,390
framework that allows the augmentation

1201
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,210
for both the sub network and also on the

1202
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:42,450
app flow side we can we can continue to

1203
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:45,000
run ahead and we can always add the for

1204
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:48,419
example the TSN's as their own documents

1205
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:52,080
as an augmentation to the base model yes

1206
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:54,990
I agree of this part but uh actually

1207
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:58,340
another one is for ten and a very young

1208
01:02:54,990 --> 01:03:01,319
model another one is aggregation the

1209
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:04,740
yeah if the sub network can be done in

1210
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:08,070
in in the future so I think aggregation

1211
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,899
case should be covered yes that

1212
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:13,530
aggregation is certainly part of the

1213
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:19,290
core MPLS and IP documents yes

1214
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:22,850
so if this part can be settled I think

1215
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:24,900
it can be a last call with other draft I

1216
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:26,250
suspect that it should Malo

1217
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:29,580
because if there's any changes that

1218
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:32,010
happen on the the data plane documents

1219
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,660
then that'll mean a necessitate a change

1220
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:38,839
here either maybe

1221
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:42,118
right after and I think if we are very

1222
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:44,549
fortunate maybe we'll be able to have

1223
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:46,559
everything last called by November but

1224
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:48,390
maybe a of all the documents we've

1225
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:51,150
talked about but I suspect it will maybe

1226
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:53,339
be halfway through by sing at the

1227
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:55,769
Singapore IETF but it's a little it's a

1228
01:03:53,339 --> 01:04:00,319
really good project the project progress

1229
01:03:55,769 --> 01:04:03,950
excuse me mm-hmm okay

1230
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,950
thank you thank you

1231
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:29,920
I'm norm Finn I'm one of the authors of

1232
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:34,470
the bounded latency draft that we think

1233
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,470
is coming along about ready for adoption

1234
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,910
just a reminder that netis about an

1235
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:46,379
upper bound to latency not low average

1236
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:48,790
latency that implies that you've if you

1237
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:51,310
you know how long it's allowed to spend

1238
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:52,810
in the network and you've got a finite

1239
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,070
amount buffers you should be able to put

1240
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:56,259
in enough buffers to achieve zero

1241
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:59,880
congestion loss and it drives the other

1242
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:02,950
way just as well if you can achieve zero

1243
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,690
congestion loss then given you've got a

1244
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:06,279
finite amount of buffer there's only so

1245
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:11,350
long that a packet can spend in the

1246
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:14,020
network feedback that slows down flows

1247
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:17,440
to avoid congestion is not an option for

1248
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:19,509
what we do here and we can get

1249
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:23,260
mathematically sound assurances that we

1250
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:29,820
can get latency and can on latency in

1251
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:34,440
congestion loss there we are

1252
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:40,480
so major changes from Rev 3 to Rev for

1253
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:43,900
section 3 was reorganized somewhat the

1254
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:47,020
the paradigm for how to reserve flows

1255
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:51,900
and so on was not in the right place I

1256
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:55,330
don't think we've made all of the

1257
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:57,040
various queueing techniques that we have

1258
01:05:55,330 --> 01:06:01,540
standards for that we know will give

1259
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:07,240
zero congestion in one section 6 as

1260
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:10,570
parallel subsections under Section 6 we

1261
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:12,399
have given the various queueing

1262
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:15,010
techniques more equal attention there

1263
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,510
was way too much in there about cyclic

1264
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:19,620
queuing and forwarding not enough about

1265
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:22,330
some others so we've even that out and

1266
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:27,210
section 8 parameters for a bounded

1267
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:30,910
latency model has been deleted so now

1268
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:35,590
Clause 3 how you create a flow in debt

1269
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:36,368
net 1 is you configure the network now

1270
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:41,259
that that's

1271
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:43,029
not silly you may provide the network or

1272
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:44,859
you may turn on certain facilities in

1273
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:49,089
the network for doing that net for

1274
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:51,038
example and configure maximum bandwidth

1275
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:54,130
so loud on certain links all sorts of

1276
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:57,249
things you might configure then two

1277
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:59,200
through five you loop you have a flow

1278
01:06:57,249 --> 01:07:01,328
that you'd like to get you care it you

1279
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,279
have to characterize the flow you have

1280
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:05,170
to establish the flow the path is going

1281
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:07,329
to take and then you have to compute

1282
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:10,269
whether or not you can accept that flow

1283
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:12,609
and what sort of latency you can give

1284
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:14,379
that flow typically the flow has a

1285
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:18,249
certain amount of latency and a certain

1286
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:20,410
amount of packet loss it can tolerate we

1287
01:07:18,249 --> 01:07:22,569
talk about two different computations

1288
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:25,118
there are two different models for how

1289
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:30,999
you figure out whether this flow can be

1290
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:33,970
handled by the network one computation

1291
01:07:30,999 --> 01:07:37,509
model depending on what queueing

1292
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:40,299
techniques you use it's likely that

1293
01:07:37,509 --> 01:07:43,319
every flow affects the latency of every

1294
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:46,119
I think every critical flow expect

1295
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:48,759
affects the latency experienced by every

1296
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:50,859
other I should say dead net flow not

1297
01:07:48,759 --> 01:07:53,460
critical flow every bit net flow affects

1298
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:55,808
the latency of every other dead net flow

1299
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:59,109
which means when you add a flow you have

1300
01:07:55,809 --> 01:08:01,119
to recompute everybody's latency and

1301
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:02,890
make sure that everybody's still within

1302
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:09,880
the bounds they asked for when they

1303
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:12,970
started some queueing techniques allow

1304
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,299
you to say when the flow says can I come

1305
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,308
in

1306
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:17,080
you can tell that you can tell the very

1307
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:18,580
first flow this is the late this is the

1308
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,948
worst case latency you it will

1309
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:23,679
experience and you know that no matter

1310
01:08:20,948 --> 01:08:25,750
what other flows come in as long as they

1311
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,179
can be admitted by the network they

1312
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:30,779
won't affect the first flows latency I

1313
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:35,589
call that the dynamic computation

1314
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:37,359
because it favors dynamism that's the

1315
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:38,979
kind of situation you want when you've

1316
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,900
got lots of flows coming and going

1317
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:42,729
unless you've got an awful lot of

1318
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:46,120
compute power the static latency

1319
01:08:42,729 --> 01:08:49,830
computation I think of as more suited to

1320
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:51,930
less dynamic environments

1321
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,760
and if the results are satisfactory you

1322
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:57,710
reserve the resources that are required

1323
01:08:53,760 --> 01:09:02,790
and you tell the sender go

1324
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:04,680
so that's described in Clause 3 clause 4

1325
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:06,930
and 5 we have gone over before it

1326
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:09,720
involves queueing model and involves the

1327
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:14,910
network calculus to figure out what the

1328
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:16,410
latency might be under the assumption

1329
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:21,180
that you've got using certain queueing

1330
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:23,880
techniques clause 6 lists the techniques

1331
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:27,720
preemption I won't go into a lot

1332
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:31,410
8'o 2.3 I Triple E 802 allows you to

1333
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:34,950
interrupt a frame transmit some other

1334
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:37,108
frames go back to transmitting the first

1335
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:40,760
frame interrupt it again transmit some

1336
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:44,310
more frames there can only be one

1337
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:48,810
interrupted frame it's not multi-level

1338
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:51,420
interrupted frames but the four main

1339
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:55,320
queuing methods we talked about our time

1340
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:59,340
scheduling where every output queue is

1341
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:01,410
gated by a scheduled gate that turns

1342
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:03,960
that queue on and off you can turn

1343
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:05,430
multiple queues on and off and in which

1344
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,180
case you use whatever queueing

1345
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:10,350
techniques whatever techniques you have

1346
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:13,140
priority for resolving which one of

1347
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:16,590
those gets to transmit we have the

1348
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:18,690
asynchronous traffic shaping which well

1349
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:20,910
let's talk about in surfer 6.5 is

1350
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:24,929
intserv a lot of us know how insurv

1351
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:28,139
works it's old but it still works where

1352
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:31,380
you have a per flow queue for the for

1353
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:35,150
the net-net flows and per class shaping

1354
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:38,510
after you go through the per flow

1355
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:41,580
queuing which we call regulator in the

1356
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:43,860
in the bounded latency document a

1357
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:46,440
synchronous traffic shaping is really

1358
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:48,719
very similar to intserv except that you

1359
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:51,809
have fewer queues you have you still

1360
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:53,880
have a state machine per flow time state

1361
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:56,550
machine per flow but you don't have to

1362
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:59,160
have as many queues as you do for in

1363
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:01,230
serve and cyclic queuing and forwarding

1364
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:03,690
is doubly double or triple buffering for

1365
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:05,669
each class on each port where

1366
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:08,759
buffers are cycled in synchrony across

1367
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:11,160
the network I think you've seen this

1368
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,630
slide this is cyclic queuing and

1369
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:18,590
forwarding the to buffer version

1370
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:20,850
basically at one moment packets

1371
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:23,969
belonging to debt net throws through

1372
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:27,810
throughout the network advanced one hop

1373
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:33,739
and then click all the packets advanced

1374
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:36,540
one more hop and click they had sorry

1375
01:11:33,739 --> 01:11:38,370
take they advanced one more hop every

1376
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:45,300
time the clock ticks all the packets in

1377
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:47,340
the network advanced one hop it's easy

1378
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:51,449
to imagine especially in a service

1379
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:53,670
provider network that the time to get

1380
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:57,030
from one to get over the wire from one

1381
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:59,870
hop to the next stop is a time that is

1382
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:03,840
comparable in length to the cycle time

1383
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:05,969
if that's true your ability to do it

1384
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,219
with two buffers is cut down because you

1385
01:12:05,969 --> 01:12:11,070
have to get the packets out of the

1386
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:12,900
buffer on one hop over the wire and into

1387
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:15,870
the buffer at the next hop within one

1388
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:17,879
cycle if that's difficult you have to

1389
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:21,809
slow the cycle way down that's not good

1390
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:23,310
so you can go to three buffers I was

1391
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:25,070
asked to show this because that got cut

1392
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:28,469
off at the last time for lack of time

1393
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:32,940
basically you have three buffers tick on

1394
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:36,540
the input side in synchrony with the

1395
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:40,379
last hops output buffer tick delayed by

1396
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:42,269
how long it takes to get to this hop so

1397
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:45,750
I take in synchrony so that all the

1398
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:47,820
packets in the read buffer in in the

1399
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:51,330
previous top all go into a single buffer

1400
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:55,639
at this hop so the input clock takes the

1401
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:59,130
output clock ticks input clock ticks

1402
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:01,469
output clock ticks and you go through

1403
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:03,750
the rotate that now you can use the full

1404
01:13:01,469 --> 01:13:05,370
cycle for filling a buffer you can use

1405
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:09,510
the full cycle time for draining a

1406
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:12,769
buffer but the inputs timing is offset

1407
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:12,770
from the output timing

1408
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:20,849
another thing we'll see queue up it's

1409
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:27,780
worth mentioning

1410
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:30,180
you can run cqf at multiple periods fast

1411
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:33,870
and slow for different classes of

1412
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,550
service at the same time to accommodate

1413
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:37,890
so that you don't have to

1414
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:40,710
you're not saddled with the choice of

1415
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:44,160
choosing a long cycle which means you

1416
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:46,410
can have lots of different flows but you

1417
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:48,809
spend a long time sitting at each hop

1418
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:51,719
and a short title which enables you to

1419
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:56,430
get good latency but you can't carry

1420
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:59,969
very many flows this summary chart is

1421
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:01,440
not in the document it could become part

1422
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:05,880
of the document but I think it's useful

1423
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:09,449
for us to look at it compares the four

1424
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,100
basic services on certain and shows that

1425
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:12,599
there are really good trade-offs and

1426
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,590
really good reasons why you would want

1427
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:19,920
to use any of these techniques the time

1428
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:22,170
schedule is really great because it

1429
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,110
allows you for instance if you have a

1430
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:26,969
machine tool that operates as many

1431
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,830
machine tools do on a cycle of

1432
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:30,870
communicate for a while think for a

1433
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:34,250
while communicate for a while think for

1434
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:38,460
a while if the communicate for a while

1435
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:40,350
uses up most of your bandwidth it's nice

1436
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:44,190
to be able to run several machine tools

1437
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:45,960
and just stagger their phase run them

1438
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:49,230
all at the same cycle stagger the phase

1439
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:52,020
so I get to use the same network for

1440
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:55,230
this for different machine tools at

1441
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:57,930
different times during the length of the

1442
01:14:55,230 --> 01:15:00,239
cycle that requires time scheduling

1443
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:02,640
that's not suitable for intserv or

1444
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:04,949
diffserv that requires strict time

1445
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:08,430
scheduling it's very hard to compute a

1446
01:15:04,949 --> 01:15:10,589
good time schedule for a network but it

1447
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:16,699
can handle almost anything and it gives

1448
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:19,260
you perfect results it's not dynamic and

1449
01:15:16,699 --> 01:15:21,929
you have to have a schedule in every cop

1450
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:24,060
within server time aware of shaping they

1451
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:26,730
are very good at efficiently using the

1452
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:28,680
bandwidth so you have very little over

1453
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:31,080
provisioning

1454
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:33,180
that tends to be a somewhat difficult

1455
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,950
computation you have to recompute

1456
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:43,050
everything whenever you change anything

1457
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:46,679
so on any attire requires first flow

1458
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:48,660
state it requires a lot of cues and it

1459
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:53,730
requires state in every top for every

1460
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:55,950
hook flow on the other hand it doesn't

1461
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:58,259
require that you time synchronize all of

1462
01:15:55,950 --> 01:16:00,240
your nodes in your network all of your

1463
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:03,360
relay nodes cyclic queuing and

1464
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:08,969
forwarding the latency computation is

1465
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:10,830
trivial it's a sum the latency you give

1466
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:12,270
one doesn't affect the others it

1467
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:14,280
typically takes somewhat more

1468
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:17,310
over-provisioning to make it work

1469
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:24,809
because of the fixed cycle times don't

1470
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:27,600
necessarily fit every single flow it the

1471
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:30,300
nice thing is it requires zero burst

1472
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,670
flow State all you need is admission

1473
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,680
control you don't need to touch any of

1474
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:38,670
the nodes along the path when you

1475
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:40,800
introduce a new flow that's good but you

1476
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:43,800
have to time synchronize everything and

1477
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,030
I will mention my little footnote here

1478
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,130
this table is a very much a

1479
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:48,450
generalization there's lots of factors

1480
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:50,520
that can mitigate some of these

1481
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:52,920
differences and there are other queuing

1482
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,490
schemes that have been proposed to make

1483
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:59,220
some what other trade-offs which is good

1484
01:16:55,490 --> 01:17:01,980
final steps we want to some of the

1485
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:04,740
terminology in the network calculus

1486
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:07,639
section doesn't really match that net

1487
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:12,210
terminology that really means to get

1488
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:14,430
fixed we need a very small amount of

1489
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:17,220
work to have the formal delay analysis

1490
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:19,890
for cqf and for the buffer size

1491
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:21,390
calculations need to be filled out we

1492
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:24,650
have to consistency check with the other

1493
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:32,400
working group drafts and we should be

1494
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:34,589
all done so to answer this question we

1495
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,839
ran a poll a couple of weeks ago yes it

1496
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:39,120
finished formally on the 15th I didn't

1497
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:42,419
actually send out the closing message

1498
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:45,449
until today

1499
01:17:42,419 --> 01:17:47,989
but it's adopted so we're ready for you

1500
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:50,159
to hit submit it with the new name and

1501
01:17:47,989 --> 01:17:52,978
we'll have a working group not yet and

1502
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:55,648
so we encourage people to read it and

1503
01:17:52,979 --> 01:17:59,209
comment on it that'll be the - zero zero

1504
01:17:55,649 --> 01:18:05,189
version yes so I can do that

1505
01:17:59,209 --> 01:18:12,800
hopefully today any questions comments

1506
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:12,800
I must be doing a good job all right

1507
01:18:13,969 --> 01:18:17,209
thanks sorry

1508
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,090
by the way we are definitely running

1509
01:18:29,479 --> 01:18:37,219
ahead of schedule so if you are in the

1510
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:38,989
second session please expect to present

1511
01:18:37,219 --> 01:18:42,019
at the end be ready to present at the

1512
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:44,148
end of this session so we'll move some

1513
01:18:42,019 --> 01:18:49,249
things that are in the second slot up to

1514
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:56,809
our second session to this session if we

1515
01:18:49,249 --> 01:18:58,969
can we by the way we do have one

1516
01:18:56,809 --> 01:19:01,039
presenter the OEM presenter who can't do

1517
01:18:58,969 --> 01:19:05,840
that so we still will be meeting at

1518
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:09,409
least for that discussion in the session

1519
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:13,429
the second session okay thank you leon

1520
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:16,699
from china mobile this is a an update of

1521
01:19:13,429 --> 01:19:20,869
the layer three or long haul large-scale

1522
01:19:16,699 --> 01:19:23,928
data net latency service requirements so

1523
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:26,959
we actually following the comments which

1524
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:29,119
received from last ISF meeting or we

1525
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:31,309
approach more service provider to

1526
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:33,379
collect more requirements for long hold

1527
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:39,439
at net service requirements and this is

1528
01:19:33,379 --> 01:19:41,300
a update of that draft so sorry just a

1529
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,519
little bit reminder that this is I

1530
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:46,010
probably need to change the name of the

1531
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:48,769
doctor that the the name of the document

1532
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:52,309
because it's so similar to North Face

1533
01:19:48,769 --> 01:19:54,649
document but these two I really really

1534
01:19:52,309 --> 01:19:56,300
not a requirement for norm fin it's

1535
01:19:54,649 --> 01:19:57,949
quite different view of the bounded

1536
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,409
latency thing this is really a

1537
01:19:57,949 --> 01:20:03,799
requirement for layer 3 and type of

1538
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:06,679
services with C and 4 for example for

1539
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:10,269
the virtualized plc for remote surgery

1540
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:13,099
etc the services requires long haul

1541
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:16,669
getting that deterministic network of

1542
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:18,619
services so that's really not to talk

1543
01:20:16,669 --> 01:20:21,519
about how we calculate or how we

1544
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:25,280
modeling the latency and there is no

1545
01:20:21,519 --> 01:20:28,239
solution or implementation specific in

1546
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:31,129
this document so this is really a

1547
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:35,178
reference or justification for our

1548
01:20:31,129 --> 01:20:38,900
working group to to to to to have a look

1549
01:20:35,179 --> 01:20:41,780
and to review whether this is a interest

1550
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:49,309
a topic that we can adopt it in in

1551
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:51,469
future work so just a quick summary of

1552
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:55,280
what we have been doing since last time

1553
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:59,030
so that the the previous version was

1554
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:03,170
only there are only three requirements

1555
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:05,660
listed and for this update we actually

1556
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:09,800
put more requirements and we can't ride

1557
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:12,950
them to different two different classes

1558
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:14,860
one is one is technical requirement and

1559
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:17,750
the other is operation and management

1560
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:20,750
requirements so we have altogether seven

1561
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:24,110
requirements collected and the first one

1562
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:27,230
and about how the requirements the

1563
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:29,200
requirements of dynamic creation and

1564
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:34,549
modification lead of the service and

1565
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:37,340
also the second one is about the time

1566
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:41,990
variance tolerance and the third one is

1567
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:45,740
to support the Intercontinental or multi

1568
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:47,330
domain or long-haul propagation delay so

1569
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:50,510
that's for the technical requirements

1570
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:52,490
and there for other operational or and

1571
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:55,180
management requirements which were

1572
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:59,990
comforting that in the in the few

1573
01:21:55,180 --> 01:22:04,370
upcoming slides so we also characterize

1574
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:08,780
sorry categorize the requirement as must

1575
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:12,019
or should because some of them are well

1576
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:16,009
in at present is quite difficult to to

1577
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:20,960
to to actually to realize so we put we

1578
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:23,960
put it's optional so in detail the first

1579
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,960
requirement is to support in layer three

1580
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:29,320
determinist network service to support a

1581
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:33,440
dynamic creation modification and delete

1582
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:37,480
or deletion of the services basically as

1583
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:43,250
more than mentioning in his presentation

1584
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:45,259
we don't want in lot a long-haul service

1585
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:48,140
we don't want the recalculation of

1586
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:52,280
everything when you add a new data net

1587
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:52,639
service to operators Network because

1588
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,769
they

1589
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,650
we'll give you scalability problem so

1590
01:22:54,770 --> 01:23:00,560
this is a requirement that we must

1591
01:22:57,650 --> 01:23:06,619
support dynamic creation or lifecycle

1592
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:08,210
management but with minimum complication

1593
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:11,019
of recalculation of everything for

1594
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:15,800
example gate control or the resource

1595
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:17,810
reservation things and the second

1596
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:21,889
requirement is to tolerate a certain

1597
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:23,750
level of time variance and maybe I need

1598
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:26,090
to change the name is not time variance

1599
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:28,010
but they're two part of it the first

1600
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:31,699
part is actually the time

1601
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:33,590
synchronization tolerance because when

1602
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:36,379
you basically talk about long-haul

1603
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:39,550
transmission you need to tolerate the

1604
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:43,250
time synchronization when you connect to

1605
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:44,929
TS in domain and well we can transmit

1606
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:49,670
the synchronization signal between

1607
01:23:44,929 --> 01:23:51,590
domains but in real network either you

1608
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:53,719
might don't have these capability of

1609
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:58,070
transmitting the synchronization signal

1610
01:23:53,719 --> 01:23:59,570
or the performance of transmitting the

1611
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:02,659
synchronization signal across a

1612
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:04,940
long-haul situation does not actually

1613
01:24:02,659 --> 01:24:07,219
meet your performance requirement so

1614
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:09,169
this is for the time synchronization the

1615
01:24:07,219 --> 01:24:11,719
second one is for your clock

1616
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:14,360
synchronization we need to tolerate a

1617
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:19,250
certain level of tutoring of the clock

1618
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:24,110
of course for just give some examples of

1619
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:27,110
the figures were looking at for crystal

1620
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:30,230
oscillator for sync II and for 5g back

1621
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:34,280
home you will have different level of

1622
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:36,799
tolerance needed the third requirement

1623
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:39,349
in technical requirement is to support

1624
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,210
intercontinental long link propagation

1625
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,909
delay without sacrificing or

1626
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:46,400
deterministic performance so basically

1627
01:24:43,909 --> 01:24:51,349
if we look at a graph on the right left

1628
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:53,570
sorry the right bottom corner let me try

1629
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:55,850
to explain this so when you when you

1630
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:59,900
look at the cyclic forwarding or psycho

1631
01:24:55,850 --> 01:25:03,230
scheduling mechanism we normally in a in

1632
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:05,719
a strongly synchronized situation we

1633
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:07,940
require the packet and

1634
01:25:05,719 --> 01:25:11,019
to be sent and received in the same

1635
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:14,539
cycle or in the same cycle the cycling

1636
01:25:11,019 --> 01:25:18,019
scheduling mechanism and that lead to a

1637
01:25:14,539 --> 01:25:21,619
consequence where you need to basically

1638
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:24,199
increase your period if you are actually

1639
01:25:21,619 --> 01:25:26,570
you are transmitting the packet with

1640
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:29,539
many many hops for a long-haul situation

1641
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:31,518
so that make your jittering performance

1642
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:33,829
to be proportional to your length of

1643
01:25:31,519 --> 01:25:37,159
transmission and that is something we

1644
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:40,849
don't really like and in for example in

1645
01:25:37,159 --> 01:25:45,110
smart factory situation these can be

1646
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:47,960
solved what sorry well in in local area

1647
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:51,650
network it is easy to understand that

1648
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:55,190
the propagation delay can be constrained

1649
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:56,598
to a certain small level and the jitter

1650
01:25:55,190 --> 01:26:00,379
can be controlled because you can have a

1651
01:25:56,599 --> 01:26:04,610
very small very little very small I'm

1652
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:07,969
cycling in period but for long haul

1653
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:12,259
that will give you trouble so there

1654
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:15,800
might be a need for a mechanism in data

1655
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:18,739
plane that the J terrain performance is

1656
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:22,159
not proportional to the length of

1657
01:26:18,739 --> 01:26:25,039
transmission can I be honest for

1658
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:26,659
speeding economic question comments to

1659
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:28,759
the to at this and the previous slide

1660
01:26:26,659 --> 01:26:31,129
you in the beginning said that you want

1661
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:36,650
to set forth requirements without

1662
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:38,869
specifying solution and actually it

1663
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:43,098
seems like you have chosen a solution

1664
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:45,348
like a cyclic queuing monism so for

1665
01:26:43,099 --> 01:26:47,449
example you just heard about the

1666
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:49,670
asynchronous traffic shaping that

1667
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:52,190
doesn't have this type of problems and

1668
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:56,719
the other assumption you are making in a

1669
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:59,749
previous slide is that in the TSN

1670
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:03,499
domains are time synchronized and that

1671
01:26:59,749 --> 01:27:05,360
is not a must so one example is a

1672
01:27:03,499 --> 01:27:06,889
synchronous traffic shaping one time

1673
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,699
synchronization is not used in many

1674
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:12,590
cases it is used but it's as I

1675
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:15,530
understand maybe I misunderstood these

1676
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:19,429
two slides but it seems you chosen a

1677
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:19,610
solution no I'm not choosing a solution

1678
01:27:19,429 --> 01:27:21,820
they

1679
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:24,580
is really just giving examples of how

1680
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:27,920
this requirement might result in

1681
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:31,010
choosing of solutions but but I'm not

1682
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:33,440
making you know assumptions of choosing

1683
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:34,880
these solutions but a good news is that

1684
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,589
it seems that there are solutions to

1685
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,780
meet these requirements like the

1686
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:41,570
asynchronous traffic shipping if you are

1687
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:44,360
picking something from the tsn2 books or

1688
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:47,750
just the three cycle safety window

1689
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:48,830
second we just heard about norm and the

1690
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:52,219
other thing yeah I just

1691
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:55,010
you mentioned the smart factory I would

1692
01:27:52,219 --> 01:27:58,820
not expect a long-haul link it's a smart

1693
01:27:55,010 --> 01:28:02,000
factories is one factory so yeah but we

1694
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:04,969
received some requirements from really

1695
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,830
large smart factories they have

1696
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:08,630
different size over the country and they

1697
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:11,059
have a centralized control center where

1698
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:13,340
they can they want their control unit to

1699
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:16,969
be plotted there there's several

1700
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:25,850
hundreds of kilometers I know that might

1701
01:28:16,969 --> 01:28:28,940
be neat to market but yeah something for

1702
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:35,050
Jason people to norm your name norm Finn

1703
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:40,960
thank you something for I knew I had one

1704
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:44,239
for the TSN people to think about is I

1705
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,850
know I missed it when I was working on I

1706
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:49,909
mean I working on bound the bound the

1707
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:51,980
latency draft I kind of wanted to put it

1708
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:56,059
in but it wasn't sure how and that's the

1709
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:59,839
Paternoster scheme which I think might

1710
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:03,050
be somewhat more useful in meeting this

1711
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:06,020
particular documents requirements in

1712
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:09,170
particular seems like it would go a long

1713
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:15,980
ways to meeting these requirements and

1714
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:18,110
that's we need to think about how to do

1715
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:20,928
that whether whether that should be done

1716
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:25,780
with with the draft whether we see that

1717
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:28,880
TSN what should we do thank you

1718
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:32,030
so um

1719
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:35,210
yeah so the that's all for the technical

1720
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:41,150
requirement and for operation and

1721
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:43,610
management so that the fourth one is we

1722
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:45,769
laid out they like should have self

1723
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:48,250
monitoring capability is basically when

1724
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:51,890
we when operator trying to sell their

1725
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:53,780
deterministic service to verticals the

1726
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:56,480
verticals are normally not expert on

1727
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:59,769
next expert on network so that would

1728
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:04,780
really like to have a visualized type of

1729
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:08,390
tool that can really see or I'll release

1730
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:10,599
being very fertile convinced that the

1731
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:14,360
service the service provided provided

1732
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:17,090
actually meet that the SI requirements

1733
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,460
of performance so we would think that

1734
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:25,240
the self monitoring capability is

1735
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:27,650
important for data net but you know

1736
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:29,240
realizing this is costly because you

1737
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:33,080
need to collect a lot of data from the

1738
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:36,080
network and do a lot of analysis and and

1739
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:39,500
portal things so we put it optional in

1740
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:42,050
five and six we didn't really put too

1741
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:45,500
much tests on the drop in the draft and

1742
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:47,890
and it's really simple that you need to

1743
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:51,470
be wrong robust against boss attacks

1744
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:56,300
because when we talk about data net

1745
01:30:51,470 --> 01:31:00,080
services most of them are in very

1746
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:03,170
critical use cases for example v2x

1747
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:06,110
or remote surgery things and so the

1748
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:09,970
security is very important and number

1749
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:13,580
six has to it must tolerant failures

1750
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:16,190
same idea because it's critical and the

1751
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:19,100
last one must be scalable when we talk

1752
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:21,200
about long haul we expect that hundreds

1753
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:24,290
or even thousands of servers running in

1754
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:26,990
the shared infrastructure of service

1755
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:29,360
provider in terms of number of devices

1756
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:33,349
and in terms of numbers flows is going

1757
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:37,190
to advocate it in Metro level or in in

1758
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:41,030
higher core level to make the network

1759
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:44,320
work it has to be scalable scale

1760
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:49,219
in terms of connected device and

1761
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:53,509
activated traffic flows yeah so that's

1762
01:31:49,219 --> 01:31:55,489
all for the update it's really an

1763
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:57,829
informational draft or informational

1764
01:31:55,489 --> 01:31:59,989
work in the inner working group we'd

1765
01:31:57,829 --> 01:32:02,360
like to hear from the audience from the

1766
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:06,230
community whether these requirements is

1767
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:10,190
a good or at least useful reference for

1768
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:14,598
detonate group to actually consider for

1769
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:16,759
future work and we've seen some

1770
01:32:14,599 --> 01:32:20,929
discussion over the list and we think

1771
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:23,500
that we have collect quite a lot of

1772
01:32:20,929 --> 01:32:26,989
requirements from a service provider and

1773
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:30,159
so we would like really to call a

1774
01:32:26,989 --> 01:32:35,150
working group adoption for this document

1775
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:38,030
no okay and no I understand let me start

1776
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:40,610
like this I really like this so I think

1777
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:43,969
it's pretty close to working group

1778
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:47,719
adoption has saying that I haven't read

1779
01:32:43,969 --> 01:32:49,489
the document but if it's as clear as the

1780
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:52,070
presentation is I think we are very

1781
01:32:49,489 --> 01:32:55,070
close to go for working group adoption I

1782
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:58,880
had it's a couple of small question can

1783
01:32:55,070 --> 01:33:01,519
you back up one slide so the must and

1784
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:06,670
should in red here are those the

1785
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:12,460
traditional ITF upper case must insured

1786
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:16,520
that's a very good comment I have to say

1787
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:20,420
as written it is but you know in a when

1788
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:23,239
we write this I I'm not that confident

1789
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:25,969
that we are I'm here to say okay I Bay

1790
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:28,519
where's the strict text description of

1791
01:33:25,969 --> 01:33:31,369
IETF definition of a mass and sure that

1792
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:34,849
that needs to be looking into more

1793
01:33:31,369 --> 01:33:37,610
characters I think if it's not you have

1794
01:33:34,849 --> 01:33:38,960
to go back and actually revisit yeah and

1795
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:43,489
change him accordingly

1796
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:45,290
I had a questions about the numbers but

1797
01:33:43,489 --> 01:33:48,888
they actually here in seven one seven

1798
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:53,920
seven two so that's fine can you back up

1799
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:53,920
one slide more you use

1800
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:59,969
the first comment here at Lincoln nodes

1801
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:05,130
failures are in themselves the polish

1802
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:08,040
changes so it's kind of the same thing

1803
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:11,010
so what I'm saying if if a link fails

1804
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:13,410
that like this at optimal you change so

1805
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:18,330
you need to tweak the language around

1806
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:23,750
that definitely yeah go back one more

1807
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:27,860
slide so I'm a little bit confused about

1808
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:30,360
the long link definition here Yusei

1809
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:33,170
Intercontinental yeah that's fine we can

1810
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:35,339
figure out what that is

1811
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:38,990
intercontinental long link is that

1812
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:42,090
something even longer or is it something

1813
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:48,050
something else so but what I'm pointing

1814
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:52,380
at here is actually there are words like

1815
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:55,610
long big massive whatever that is not

1816
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:58,350
defined and I think we should put some

1817
01:34:55,610 --> 01:35:01,679
effort into actually defining what it

1818
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:04,230
really is yeah that that's very good

1819
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:07,680
suggestion now what will already take

1820
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:09,750
good care of the language here um yes

1821
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:12,120
and basically a little bit of

1822
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:14,850
explanation of this it's really not that

1823
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:16,470
complicated to have this so many were to

1824
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:19,620
describe long or intercutting what is

1825
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:22,260
really just a long-haul situation so we

1826
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:30,809
need to rephrase the rows to better

1827
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:33,980
describe this thank you so any more

1828
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:33,980
comments and question

1829
01:35:44,139 --> 01:35:49,320
sorry we're taking your some a remote

1830
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:57,699
question yes right

1831
01:35:49,320 --> 01:36:01,409
Ethan yes so this seems rather like the

1832
01:35:57,699 --> 01:36:04,629
use case draft in the sense that it's

1833
01:36:01,409 --> 01:36:07,018
looking at making sure that the

1834
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:09,699
capabilities agree with the real-world

1835
01:36:07,019 --> 01:36:13,539
requirements and I guess one question I

1836
01:36:09,699 --> 01:36:16,119
had was the some of the things that you

1837
01:36:13,539 --> 01:36:17,949
mentioned here seemed to be already part

1838
01:36:16,119 --> 01:36:20,018
of the common themes in the use case

1839
01:36:17,949 --> 01:36:21,969
draft so they they seemed to be already

1840
01:36:20,019 --> 01:36:25,599
a part of what we're what we're doing

1841
01:36:21,969 --> 01:36:29,199
here and also I guess in the use cases

1842
01:36:25,599 --> 01:36:32,919
draft we've specifically avoided the the

1843
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:35,018
must and should and words requirements

1844
01:36:32,919 --> 01:36:37,929
because we you know we're trying to

1845
01:36:35,019 --> 01:36:39,999
guide the work and and not define what

1846
01:36:37,929 --> 01:36:42,369
has to be done so I guess if we were to

1847
01:36:39,999 --> 01:36:44,949
adopt this is a work group document I

1848
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:46,749
guess I'm I'm trying to figure out what

1849
01:36:44,949 --> 01:36:50,919
the relationship between this would be

1850
01:36:46,749 --> 01:36:58,119
and and the use cases draft you thought

1851
01:36:50,919 --> 01:37:01,360
about that yeah um well I I I understand

1852
01:36:58,119 --> 01:37:03,280
your concern but the use case is really

1853
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:05,259
in a service or application point of

1854
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:09,130
view of describing what the application

1855
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:11,619
means the the what application actually

1856
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:13,179
require the the network to be like in

1857
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:17,259
terms of functionality and performance

1858
01:37:13,179 --> 01:37:20,649
but this requirements exactly technical

1859
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:22,599
requirement is is you know the use cases

1860
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:25,209
is a service point of view that

1861
01:37:22,599 --> 01:37:28,979
requirements Network point of view and

1862
01:37:25,209 --> 01:37:31,300
use case could be a guideline for the

1863
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:36,309
working group or the dinner net so to

1864
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:38,530
consider what detonates that's a net in

1865
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:40,689
terms of technical point of view

1866
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:43,199
required to have these type of

1867
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:46,989
functionality or these type of

1868
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:51,428
performance so I I don't see they are

1869
01:37:46,989 --> 01:37:53,739
overlapping but I might need to review a

1870
01:37:51,429 --> 01:37:56,889
long time not reading reuse case but I

1871
01:37:53,739 --> 01:38:00,218
might need to reread it and to see the

1872
01:37:56,889 --> 01:38:04,900
they're any you know misunderstanding

1873
01:38:00,219 --> 01:38:06,850
this how these valleys is raised to make

1874
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:10,179
you have this kind of concern so

1875
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:13,119
actually the new skills or documents

1876
01:38:10,179 --> 01:38:15,670
sets forth requirements and it's a good

1877
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:18,849
set of requirements but it could be one

1878
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:20,830
chapter service provider network use

1879
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:23,230
case with its requirements in the use

1880
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:31,650
cases document and it's a bit late for

1881
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:34,928
that because we have probably RFC but I

1882
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:36,420
think we'll talk about requirement

1883
01:38:34,929 --> 01:38:38,320
people have different understandings

1884
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:41,409
sometimes it's like use case

1885
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:43,980
requirements like in 3gpp requirement

1886
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:46,809
requirement can stand for use cases but

1887
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:49,690
this requirements document really does

1888
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:51,520
not talk about use cases like like video

1889
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:55,259
audio or things like that it's really

1890
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:58,179
what the network we think need to be

1891
01:38:55,260 --> 01:39:01,480
function or need to have that sort of

1892
01:38:58,179 --> 01:39:08,139
performance so and given the fact that

1893
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:09,820
use case hasn't published yeah but one

1894
01:39:08,139 --> 01:39:12,340
of the requirements in use cases for

1895
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:13,599
example factor for vector automation the

1896
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:16,090
machine to machine the number of

1897
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:18,460
consecutive packets can be lost that's a

1898
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:21,489
very specific network requirement what

1899
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:23,940
has been rolled into later on in the

1900
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:23,940
document

1901
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:40,388
have you really document have you made a

1902
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:44,860
clear distinction between synchronizing

1903
01:39:40,389 --> 01:39:51,310
time in the various parts of the network

1904
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:55,389
and having the same frequency in the

1905
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:59,170
various parts of the network I know that

1906
01:39:55,389 --> 01:40:03,219
there are service provider networks that

1907
01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:07,349
maintain frequency lock without

1908
01:40:03,219 --> 01:40:13,619
necessarily time synchronization

1909
01:40:07,349 --> 01:40:17,940
and for example cqf can be made to work

1910
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:25,290
with frequency synchronization without

1911
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:27,659
necessarily requiring time absolute time

1912
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:32,310
synchronization and some of the other

1913
01:40:27,659 --> 01:40:36,230
techniques also work can give really

1914
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:40,079
good results with frequency lock without

1915
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:41,790
synchronization lock have you do you

1916
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:47,519
make that distinction in the document

1917
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:49,710
yes we that if I can go back the is

1918
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:58,520
basically the time synchronization and

1919
01:40:49,710 --> 01:41:01,829
the yeah basically we distinguish the

1920
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:06,420
time synchronization time variance and

1921
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:11,699
the clock or frequency variants into two

1922
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:13,590
different requirements I need to

1923
01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:15,210
rephrase the fat under the title the

1924
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:27,139
title is not correct it's not time

1925
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:30,690
parent is really time and clock so

1926
01:41:27,139 --> 01:41:34,469
asynchronous clocks does does that mean

1927
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:38,219
that you have also different frequency

1928
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:40,469
domains that's that's yes that's what I

1929
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:42,210
don't stand do what I don't understand

1930
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:44,489
is so from what he sings so from one

1931
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:48,420
domain to another that they may be

1932
01:41:44,489 --> 01:41:49,919
operating not just different frequency

1933
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:53,190
but you're saying within the domain it's

1934
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:57,119
fine to have this you it's it you can

1935
01:41:53,190 --> 01:42:00,019
operate with you have a certain level

1936
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:03,989
it's it's not a problem to have

1937
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:05,940
frequency lock but that to be within a

1938
01:42:03,989 --> 01:42:08,400
tolerance well everything's within a

1939
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:11,638
tolerance and you know there's no such

1940
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:15,659
thing as perfect yeah definitely its

1941
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:17,639
reference to to to for example for 5g

1942
01:42:15,659 --> 01:42:21,389
backhaul I don't remember the exact

1943
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:25,740
number but is smaller than the

1944
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:29,670
the previous two examples and that's the

1945
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:36,780
tolerance and we need to obey for for

1946
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:37,770
for clocks a synchronization that's norm

1947
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:40,050
it sounds like I think there's probably

1948
01:42:37,770 --> 01:42:42,480
a good conversation to have after line

1949
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:44,640
the key numbers I remember from finally

1950
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:47,549
please Stuart Bryant the key numbers I

1951
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:50,790
remember from 5g or 1.2 microseconds or

1952
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:52,680
you can't work at all and there seem to

1953
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:55,980
be a whole variety of different numbers

1954
01:42:52,680 --> 01:43:00,150
between 350 nanoseconds going down to

1955
01:42:55,980 --> 01:43:03,950
150 nanoseconds to get the optimum use

1956
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:08,160
so you I can imagine that those sorts of

1957
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:10,679
qualities of time are going to be almost

1958
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:18,269
commodity in the network because every

1959
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:19,800
transmitter is going to need it I think

1960
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:21,120
the number Stuart mentioned we need to

1961
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:24,210
differentiate between the front hall

1962
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:26,040
that is the G note B to the base station

1963
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:27,570
and the back hall there may be some

1964
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,610
differences we need to look into that

1965
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:33,630
do you have any idea on that number such

1966
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:35,910
what is the clocks increments you mean

1967
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:40,980
the exact number as I mentioned back

1968
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:43,260
Hollyer yeah but I well I was doing back

1969
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:46,320
home for long long time before 4G and 3G

1970
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:48,800
but I don't remember the exact number 5g

1971
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,799
but I can check

1972
01:43:53,630 --> 01:44:01,520
not on time sink I may be actually on

1973
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:03,500
the list at that so I'm not I'm not sure

1974
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:06,380
if it is debt net requirements really on

1975
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:08,030
on time seeing all these time sink

1976
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:10,910
requirements are all on to death net

1977
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:13,280
because we said that we mean in a

1978
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,080
deployment that the deployment you

1979
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:18,230
choose your time singh solution you

1980
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:20,870
prefer to end adequate for for you so

1981
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:23,839
i'm not sure if you should make the time

1982
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:25,610
thinking amended that network so it's

1983
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,320
it's it's a really good work we give it

1984
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:29,120
sort of requirements I'm not sure how to

1985
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:40,160
document and what we're the

1986
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:44,599
clarifications are I think we need to

1987
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:46,280
wrap up this this conversation and to do

1988
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:48,290
that I'd like to understand from the

1989
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:51,290
room how many think people in the room

1990
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:53,000
think that this is a this topic is one

1991
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:56,600
that the working group should continue

1992
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,210
discussion discussing excuse me and be

1993
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:02,210
working on to refine and to document

1994
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:04,820
remember the the product of the ITF are

1995
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:06,980
documents so is this something we should

1996
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:09,349
be working on with an aim towards

1997
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:10,759
documenting so if you think this is

1998
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:14,780
something we should be working on can

1999
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:18,110
you wait hands up I call that a

2000
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:22,130
reasonable number how many think we

2001
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:26,000
should not be working on this no one so

2002
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:31,100
that that's pretty clear how many folks

2003
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:32,600
have read the document it's less than

2004
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:35,510
we're before but still a reasonable

2005
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:37,850
number how many think that this is a

2006
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:43,670
reasonable starting point for our work

2007
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:46,160
in this area each time we've had less

2008
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:48,560
hands this is an okay number the other

2009
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:51,260
two numbers were good is it this is just

2010
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:55,160
okay so I think there's a little

2011
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:57,980
weakness there so let's maybe you talked

2012
01:45:55,160 --> 01:46:00,470
about some some updates perhaps go

2013
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:01,730
through those updates see if we can have

2014
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:04,610
some more discussion continue the

2015
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:07,459
discussion on the list and if we really

2016
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:09,230
want we have time in the second session

2017
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:13,820
you can come back we can talk about it

2018
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:16,759
more so if we want we will have more

2019
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:18,530
time to talk about it I'm just I sort of

2020
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:22,250
think we're reaching diminishing returns

2021
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:31,880
for the rest of the group we don't count

2022
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:36,080
individuals or specific numbers and okay

2023
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:38,810
I think he Andy was putting his hand up

2024
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:44,210
for all three one additional hand isn't

2025
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:46,670
something that okay so we're just having

2026
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:48,020
since others can't hear the mic we just

2027
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:49,730
wanted had someone who wanted to make

2028
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:51,890
sure that if they were remote they

2029
01:46:49,730 --> 01:46:53,599
wanted that that comment was captured we

2030
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:56,120
think the comment has been captured

2031
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,400
if someone remote has something to say

2032
01:46:56,120 --> 01:47:02,480
just say that mic and we'll make sure to

2033
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:04,040
get it in there alright so thank you and

2034
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:07,250
again we're gonna have time afterwards

2035
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:09,200
so if we want to have discussion on this

2036
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:11,810
we should take advantage of the the fact

2037
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:14,019
that we're all here so thank you thanks

2038
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:14,020
a lot

2039
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:23,000
now we're gonna jump now to the control

2040
01:47:21,739 --> 01:47:25,509
playing frameworks your song are you

2041
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,510
still in the room

2042
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:48,950
oh no no I'm sorry wrong document it's

2043
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:48,950
still you but I had the wrong title

2044
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:59,190
right I'm sorry this is your song and I

2045
01:47:57,030 --> 01:48:02,570
want to introduce our work about the ten

2046
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:06,450
that SRA six data plan encapsulation

2047
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:11,730
actually the the data plan works for

2048
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:15,510
then that is kind of kind of going to be

2049
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:18,360
closed or is it a lot of work has

2050
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:22,710
already been done but we still think

2051
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:26,730
it's necessary to discuss some new new

2052
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:32,790
topic to this this area we want to use

2053
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:38,669
sr6 as a very useful tool to carry data

2054
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:41,880
net service I'm not sure whether all the

2055
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:44,580
people in this room familiar with SRS

2056
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:48,950
six basically I sorry six is the

2057
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:54,120
segmented routine that is applied to the

2058
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:57,750
ipv6 data plan the SRS six header is the

2059
01:48:54,120 --> 01:49:02,880
extension of the ipv6 header and there

2060
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:07,469
is a segment least in the SRH which can

2061
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:09,000
indicate the path of the service also

2062
01:49:07,469 --> 01:49:13,410
the optional Tobs

2063
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:16,050
are included again as our SRH and the

2064
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:19,380
network programming is allowed in SMS

2065
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:22,800
six because the functions can be ended

2066
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:25,230
in the seat of the SRH and this function

2067
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:29,270
can indicate the packet processing a

2068
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:29,269
particular node of that another domain

2069
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:35,519
here is the 10 that as our six data plan

2070
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:39,030
requirement first we should have a

2071
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:42,090
method of identifying the sr6 payload

2072
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:45,540
type a note DSA p-value but some other

2073
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:47,459
method second a suitable explicit

2074
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:51,360
routine to deliver that then

2075
01:49:47,459 --> 01:49:53,369
Flo this is naturally supported by SRS

2076
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:55,739
six because we can define a second at

2077
01:49:53,369 --> 01:49:58,530
least to do this and a method of

2078
01:49:55,739 --> 01:50:00,749
indicating the packet processing such as

2079
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:04,438
a packet replication elimination

2080
01:50:00,749 --> 01:50:07,610
ordering function and also to implement

2081
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:10,469
these functions we will need the item

2082
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:12,808
identification of the Dynaflow and also

2083
01:50:10,469 --> 01:50:15,630
that then that sequence number actually

2084
01:50:12,809 --> 01:50:18,360
also we should have a method of carrying

2085
01:50:15,630 --> 01:50:20,909
cueing and forwarding indication to do

2086
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:23,098
the congestion protection but this is

2087
01:50:20,909 --> 01:50:28,469
not covered in this version of the draft

2088
01:50:23,099 --> 01:50:29,699
yet here is the SRS six data plans

2089
01:50:28,469 --> 01:50:33,329
solution overview

2090
01:50:29,699 --> 01:50:37,289
actually we list some options about how

2091
01:50:33,329 --> 01:50:39,389
to do this basically we should carry the

2092
01:50:37,289 --> 01:50:43,349
flow identification the sequence number

2093
01:50:39,389 --> 01:50:47,400
in as our six header the first option is

2094
01:50:43,349 --> 01:50:50,820
we can carry this in as our htlv and the

2095
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:52,949
second option is we can extend the

2096
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:57,360
function and a carrot in the arguments

2097
01:50:52,949 --> 01:51:00,299
of the seat the third operation option

2098
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:02,880
is that we can define a new dynasty for

2099
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:06,570
these information and this it is not for

2100
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:10,229
routing it's just for the net and here

2101
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:14,188
is an overview how to do this this is an

2102
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:16,650
example of how to use as our s6 to do

2103
01:51:14,189 --> 01:51:19,199
packet replication and elimination it is

2104
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:20,900
not the only way to do this it's just an

2105
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:24,839
example

2106
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:29,150
first the on station it will send out a

2107
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:32,760
pv6 had ipv6 packet and the in the u.s.

2108
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:37,400
in the ingress the packet is

2109
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:42,209
encapsulated with outer ipv6 header this

2110
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:46,049
ipv6 header one is carried with as our

2111
01:51:42,209 --> 01:51:48,360
h1 and this sr h1 will steers the packet

2112
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:52,499
from the ingress node to the relay node

2113
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:54,869
1 and the the function in the as our h1

2114
01:51:52,499 --> 01:51:57,329
will indicate the packet to do

2115
01:51:54,869 --> 01:52:01,230
replication in relay node 1 and this

2116
01:51:57,329 --> 01:52:04,590
packet is replicated into two packets

2117
01:52:01,230 --> 01:52:08,160
and the packet is also our D capsulated

2118
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:13,410
and in kubinka blue encapsulated with

2119
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:16,080
two two new headers one of them is ipv6

2120
01:52:13,410 --> 01:52:21,330
header - and one of them is ipv6 header

2121
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:23,580
3 and the SRH included in these 3 ipv6

2122
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:26,160
header is different because the these

2123
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:30,780
packets will go through different paths

2124
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:34,590
to avoid equipment failure or other

2125
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:37,790
causes of loss and you know related to

2126
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:40,860
the the redundant packet will be

2127
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:43,670
eliminated and the left packet will be

2128
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:47,429
forwarded with a new a few basics header

2129
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:50,220
ipv6 hang therefore and the as rh4 will

2130
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:53,100
steer the packet from relay node to to

2131
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:55,440
the egress and the you know egress the

2132
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:59,640
packet will be d capsulated and the

2133
01:52:55,440 --> 01:53:02,549
native ipv6 header will be remained and

2134
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:04,860
the packet will go to the ana station to

2135
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:08,850
a so in this feature we can see that

2136
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:10,889
with sr 6 we can implement packet

2137
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:14,820
replication and the elimination ordering

2138
01:53:10,890 --> 01:53:18,300
and all these functions easy easily so i

2139
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:21,599
think it's a good good option for

2140
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:24,600
tonight of with sr 6 implementation

2141
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:28,290
actually this document is aimed to

2142
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:31,800
become a working group document more

2143
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:34,769
comments are welcome here i said the

2144
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:38,910
document is asked for is asking for

2145
01:53:34,770 --> 01:53:41,790
working adoption this is not because the

2146
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:43,410
document is perfect now and this is the

2147
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:46,320
chest of the second version of this

2148
01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:50,400
dogma document just because that the

2149
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:52,980
document of data plan solutions again

2150
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:55,980
the tenor working group are just under

2151
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:58,980
discussion if we can adopt this draft i

2152
01:53:55,980 --> 01:54:01,589
think we can catch the the discussion

2153
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:06,239
and the all the data plan solutions can

2154
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:07,770
be considered together yes please yes i

2155
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:10,709
have a question actually I'm a bit

2156
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:13,380
confused what you are exactly

2157
01:54:10,709 --> 01:54:15,979
and I'm trying to figure out what is the

2158
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:19,199
reason for confusion so segment routing

2159
01:54:15,979 --> 01:54:30,539
was always discussed is one of the tools

2160
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:40,650
to establish the exit routes for IP get

2161
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:44,280
the point solution without actually I

2162
01:54:40,650 --> 01:54:46,829
see it's kind of a new IP data plan for

2163
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:50,670
dotnet with new fields there's our

2164
01:54:46,829 --> 01:54:54,030
basics framework or something like that

2165
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:58,199
so I proposed a new IP data plane to

2166
01:54:54,030 --> 01:55:01,429
specific to a sorry six I think I know

2167
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:04,499
because I think the previous IP

2168
01:55:01,429 --> 01:55:07,769
discipline solution for dinette is more

2169
01:55:04,499 --> 01:55:11,099
about the native IP not as a v6 right

2170
01:55:07,769 --> 01:55:15,840
and this is the extension for SMS six so

2171
01:55:11,099 --> 01:55:23,039
it's a totally new story yeah mic up

2172
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:24,409
microphone microphone please it could

2173
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:27,179
use a new one

2174
01:55:24,409 --> 01:55:28,949
Brian a kid is a new I'm sorry I keep

2175
01:55:27,179 --> 01:55:31,860
forgetting so it clearly is a new data

2176
01:55:28,949 --> 01:55:33,869
plane but it serves best properties that

2177
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:36,780
we don't have in the existing ones and

2178
01:55:33,869 --> 01:55:38,610
we should look at it seriously I think

2179
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:41,539
we should also take into account there's

2180
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:44,429
a huge huge amount of work going on in

2181
01:55:41,539 --> 01:55:46,518
SR at the moment and network programming

2182
01:55:44,429 --> 01:55:48,689
if you were in spring this morning and

2183
01:55:46,519 --> 01:55:49,939
goodness knows which one of those is the

2184
01:55:48,689 --> 01:55:54,559
right one to pick

2185
01:55:49,939 --> 01:55:59,789
yes and this this document will also be

2186
01:55:54,559 --> 01:56:03,139
presented in the I think tomorrow in the

2187
01:55:59,789 --> 01:56:06,478
six men working group and we just try to

2188
01:56:03,139 --> 01:56:11,039
show this work to more people who are

2189
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:13,920
familiar with SMS six and we can seek

2190
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:16,380
feedback from them but we also think

2191
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:19,439
it's very necessary antenna working

2192
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:22,709
group to to see the as a v6 can do this

2193
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:24,090
can you implement data net I think it's

2194
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:26,760
necessary

2195
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:28,890
I I think I probably agree it's

2196
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:33,360
certainly necessary to have pray off in

2197
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:35,460
the IP domain yes for sure and I guess

2198
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:41,849
people want an SR v6 solution as well

2199
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:44,070
yes thank you so there clearly is for as

2200
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:45,840
Stewart mentioned for those who attended

2201
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:50,130
the spring working group there's clearly

2202
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:52,500
a lot of flux in SR v6 at the moment

2203
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:54,720
that's it that is a good thing that to

2204
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:57,810
be aware of and something separately to

2205
01:56:54,720 --> 01:57:02,910
track we first have the first question

2206
01:56:57,810 --> 01:57:04,860
is is this a topic that met SR v6 is

2207
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:06,510
that a topic ooh that this working group

2208
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:08,849
wants to be working on with an

2209
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:12,330
understanding is that goes beyond the

2210
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:14,160
addition the current set of data playing

2211
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:16,440
solutions we've been looking at so do we

2212
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:20,340
want to expand our solution set to

2213
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:27,269
include SR v6 if you are interested in

2214
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:30,960
that can you put up a hand there's a few

2215
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:34,650
people if you think we should not be

2216
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:38,160
working on debt net SR v6 can you put up

2217
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:40,080
a hand low it doesn't like by phrase the

2218
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:41,580
questions for some reason so you're not

2219
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:44,940
if you're not if you think we should not

2220
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:50,100
be working on that okay so the first one

2221
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:51,360
had a few the second one had none so I

2222
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:53,370
think that's that's reasonable

2223
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:57,809
information I've now generated a Q

2224
01:57:53,370 --> 01:58:00,809
Pascal let's get you here so um I'm

2225
01:57:57,810 --> 01:58:03,630
curious because there are two things

2226
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:06,300
right there is to lay out the path and

2227
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:08,070
then there is the dynamics of this like

2228
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:11,790
how many packets goes through this path

2229
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:16,620
and now you you turn your Q's etc and I

2230
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:19,890
see how a service six can be used to

2231
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:21,450
Scott encode serialize a complex path

2232
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:25,320
which is not necessarily a series of

2233
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:28,200
hops so we can see all that stuff I see

2234
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:31,380
less how you can signal everything we

2235
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:33,269
need to signal in the packet right like

2236
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:35,730
the right or anything like that that has

2237
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:38,000
to be a state which is maintained in the

2238
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:40,379
hops so

2239
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,450
whatever you do it seems to me that

2240
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:45,510
there is a balance between what goes in

2241
01:58:42,450 --> 01:58:47,639
the packet and what tear must be a state

2242
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:50,040
that still needs to be resident in the

2243
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:53,460
hops at the very extreme

2244
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:56,570
with already have work at beer where the

2245
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:59,820
bits just indicate the segment's like

2246
01:58:56,570 --> 01:59:02,099
replication but more thing about the

2247
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:04,080
real-time or anything above just one be

2248
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:06,540
to say I'm using it meaning that the

2249
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:07,920
purpose is strictly already laid out

2250
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:10,560
just like in that net

2251
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:13,710
everything is in the hops all the state

2252
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:15,660
and what we do is just decide per packet

2253
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:17,220
whether we use this reservation for this

2254
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:21,030
packet or we don't just to save

2255
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:22,860
resources right when I see this I have a

2256
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:23,610
feeling that way you could signor dig

2257
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:26,429
the same thing

2258
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:28,170
or you could signal more but I don't see

2259
01:59:26,430 --> 01:59:30,090
that you can signal it all

2260
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:32,490
you still need a state that's this

2261
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:37,710
balanced and curious about know you feel

2262
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:40,050
about it actually I understand your your

2263
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:43,170
concerns and I have read your draft

2264
01:59:40,050 --> 01:59:46,370
about the beer kind of solution I think

2265
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:49,230
it's really an interesting option for

2266
01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:51,510
for do a packet replication and

2267
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:53,629
elimination because the the packet

2268
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:55,920
replication the administration

2269
01:59:53,630 --> 02:00:00,060
elimination this function kind of

2270
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:03,900
similar to the multicast case so if we

2271
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:08,430
use beer is natural yes it's a natural

2272
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:11,639
idea but it's totally a different story

2273
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:14,700
between the beer and sr6 in beer we just

2274
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:17,670
use the the bit to show the path and we

2275
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:22,080
don't need more status in a note yes

2276
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:25,560
it's a good choice but yeah yes but I

2277
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:29,940
think it's it doesn't means that the sr6

2278
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:31,920
solution is not valuable or useful yes I

2279
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:34,919
think it's another solution another way

2280
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:38,400
and I'm actually if this works I think

2281
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:40,560
it will be good too this is Stewart

2282
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:43,740
round again so there's two high order

2283
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:47,300
bits first off we do need a full bone IP

2284
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:52,320
solution that will be deployable in

2285
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:55,980
regular IP networks now whether those

2286
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:58,799
networks will be running sv6

2287
02:00:55,980 --> 02:01:01,709
I don't know because SRB six is really

2288
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:04,349
more of a service provider sort of

2289
02:01:01,710 --> 02:01:06,239
domain so that so if we even if we do

2290
02:01:04,349 --> 02:01:09,360
this then they're still potentially a

2291
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:13,860
demand for a regular IP full-blown

2292
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:15,630
solution secondly this has to align with

2293
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:19,769
what is going to get deployed for

2294
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:22,500
network slicing in practical 5g networks

2295
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:26,670
and as far as I know the industry is

2296
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:29,340
still not quite clear what it is going

2297
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:31,560
to do I know there is a big push for sr

2298
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:33,570
v6 for this equally well what I hear

2299
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:37,770
from 3gpp is they're not necessarily

2300
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:40,860
sold on that as a design yes I think the

2301
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:44,460
intention of this drops they won't just

2302
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:48,420
I think it's not it's just another

2303
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:51,540
option to do that net with as I were six

2304
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:53,190
but if we want a native IP I think that

2305
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:55,469
the current worker can cover the

2306
02:01:53,190 --> 02:01:57,928
requirements right and you we want to do

2307
02:01:55,469 --> 02:02:03,929
this with sr6 and we have a new draft

2308
02:01:57,929 --> 02:02:06,360
just that is that yeah the intention now

2309
02:02:03,929 --> 02:02:10,880
the current work does not support full

2310
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:12,900
debt net in a regular I don't work the

2311
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:15,540
data frame graphs that we've been

2312
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:17,519
writing the yes yes the ones that we've

2313
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:20,599
been writing they do not support the pre

2314
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:24,989
off function yes so we do not have a

2315
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:27,060
full-service IP solution and I think we

2316
02:02:24,989 --> 02:02:29,339
should remember that now if this if

2317
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:31,320
people if the people so we have an

2318
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:33,900
equivalent one to this we have IP over

2319
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:36,809
and kill us and this so IP / sr v6 would

2320
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:38,549
be an equivalent yeah you could do it we

2321
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:40,170
should probably move we're actually I'm

2322
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:44,580
running out of time so we should go to

2323
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:47,010
the last two folks in line Oh LuAnn

2324
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:52,019
isn't the first what Stuart said I think

2325
02:02:47,010 --> 02:02:53,730
I agree 100% with that I have you said

2326
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:56,610
that I didn't like how you phrased the

2327
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:58,739
questions and the reason I didn't like

2328
02:02:56,610 --> 02:03:02,219
the question was that I think it's too

2329
02:02:58,739 --> 02:03:05,308
early we need to wait and see where s

2330
02:03:02,219 --> 02:03:10,860
re6 goes and if s are

2331
02:03:05,309 --> 02:03:13,070
is going to be part of a death net type

2332
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:19,829
of network then we need to do something

2333
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:22,619
if it's fully apart then we and we can

2334
02:03:19,829 --> 02:03:26,518
leave it but we can't make that decision

2335
02:03:22,619 --> 02:03:30,119
today but but Tazawa I think I have to

2336
02:03:26,519 --> 02:03:34,679
mention that SRH is stable now I think

2337
02:03:30,119 --> 02:03:36,709
it has already being adopted as FC

2338
02:03:34,679 --> 02:03:40,829
standard track so I think the essa

2339
02:03:36,709 --> 02:03:42,599
perhaps the SR v6 how to implement as

2340
02:03:40,829 --> 02:03:46,590
our six in the future is still under

2341
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:49,409
discussion but the encapsulation of sr6

2342
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:54,959
for example the SRH this kind of header

2343
02:03:49,409 --> 02:03:59,009
is they go enough I think so not Marc

2344
02:03:54,959 --> 02:04:00,479
from from Huawei so there's a possible

2345
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:06,570
mentioned dad the beer can be a

2346
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:09,300
community searching for right so this is

2347
02:04:06,570 --> 02:04:12,449
srte this is not a beer talk if we have

2348
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:12,749
a beer we only have a contribution let's

2349
02:04:12,449 --> 02:04:15,329
go

2350
02:04:12,749 --> 02:04:18,239
if we have a contribution that that's it

2351
02:04:15,329 --> 02:04:20,190
talks about debt net and beer we should

2352
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:21,570
talk about it there we should not talk

2353
02:04:20,190 --> 02:04:24,268
about beer right now because we are

2354
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:26,280
actually over time so this topic is SR

2355
02:04:24,269 --> 02:04:28,530
v6 if you have a comment up mock if you

2356
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:34,469
have a comment on SR v6 please make it

2357
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:36,239
if it's about beer please don't can I

2358
02:04:34,469 --> 02:04:37,800
say something I mention I should not

2359
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:40,320
have mentioned beer I apologize for that

2360
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:41,639
I was trying to say there is something

2361
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,380
you can signal in the packet and

2362
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:45,900
something which must be a state in the

2363
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:48,119
note I was mentioning view as an extreme

2364
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:50,159
case while everything is in the node but

2365
02:04:48,119 --> 02:04:52,199
just enabling and I was saying hey you

2366
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:53,728
have to these to tell us what goes in

2367
02:04:52,199 --> 02:04:56,009
the packet what still needs to be a

2368
02:04:53,729 --> 02:04:57,809
stake that's just what I wanted so we're

2369
02:04:56,010 --> 02:05:01,530
missing out your keys what we're going

2370
02:04:57,809 --> 02:05:05,249
to do is put both of these two topics at

2371
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:07,739
the end of our agenda though this this

2372
02:05:05,249 --> 02:05:09,510
one and the previous one and bring up

2373
02:05:07,739 --> 02:05:11,879
the speakers and see where we go from

2374
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:13,499
there and if we have more conversation

2375
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:16,829
we'll take advantage over the comments

2376
02:05:13,499 --> 02:05:18,690
okay all right so we will be back here

2377
02:05:16,829 --> 02:05:41,519
and

2378
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:44,809
fifteen minutes give us separate doesn't

2379
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,810
matter it's here in this room
