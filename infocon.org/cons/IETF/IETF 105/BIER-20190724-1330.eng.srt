00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,158
hi

2
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:11,110
I figure one here for beer today is

3
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:16,640
calling Tony Tony in the room hello Tony

4
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:22,120
you wish anyone have beer with Tony last

5
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,119
night I've not seen him yet this morning

6
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,709
seriously

7
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,850
holy crap I'm gonna just text him first

8
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,140
we'll start but I want to make sure he

9
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,700
knows we're starting without him and

10
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,700
maybe we can see if he's okay

11
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,010
all right a set of attacks hopefully

12
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,510
hear from him I'm gonna sit over here

13
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,980
but that kind of doesn't let me address

14
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,450
that because I've to run slides from

15
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,929
this side

16
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:59,470

72
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,620
the cue what's going on so what we chose

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,020
to do with four or five documents ready

74
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,120
for last call I didn't want us hammer

75
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,849
cuz right we're all volunteers for time

76
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,139
for the IETF is voluntary right I I

77
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,400
don't expect people to respond

78
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,349
immediately but with a two-week window

79
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,750
at least say yes or no let's just

80
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:08,960
progress so let's look at the stats okay

81
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,210
we had cleared our IPA cleared in

82
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,919
February still waiting for a shepherd

83
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,359
I've hammered the de list a few times

84
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,940
looking for shepherds and we don't have

85
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,560
them so I do have someone just stepped

86
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,389
up this morning volunteered for this one

87
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,529
so I've got a shepherd assigned for that

88
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:26,210
and we'll move let's move down te arc

89
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:29,000
for people respond to the thread saying

90
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,960
I accept this as a word as a last call

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,839
nobody else we can't call that consensus

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,638
I can't in good conscience send that off

93
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,360
that iesg

94
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,250
all right there's a lot of people

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,199
participate in here this is significant

96
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,370
addition to the overall architecture of

97
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,949

98
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,469

good review so at least toilets didn't

100
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:53,659
he he did rev it so I guess there's some

101
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,188
input that's taking place but this is

102

105
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,009

106
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:05,750
be know if you don't think is ready for

107

last call if there's comments but please

108
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,510

109
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:12,980

110
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:15,260

113
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,390
speak chef he's tried and failed

114
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,940
countless time shut the door shut the

115
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:32,330
door turn off the recording devices bTW

116
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,180
pls we got eight responses that was good

117
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,520
that's on the high side but we had the

118
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,650
author made thirty first we had some

119
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,719
really good comments about the document

120
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,440
itself which kind of sat dead I tried to

121
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,570
kick him a bit

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,670
July 12th we actually had a reply to the

123
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,640
doc good so some practice product versus

124
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:53,840
make is moving forward however I think

125
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,219
the comments weren't a rev because there

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,500
was some Corrections there was some

127
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,740
clarifications so I would like to see

128
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,360
that revved once rather than and

129
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,370
submitted we can go back to last call on

130
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,880
that get confirmation and get a Shepherd

131
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,530
and we'll move em LD and PIM signaling

132
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,640
are both just sitting in my queue I was

133
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,150
just kind of waiting for these others

134
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,400
progress before I take them to the list

135
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,479
but if you think there's something we

136
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,359
can celebrate on that we can move

137
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:24,560
forward something listen yeah so MLD we

138
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,600
retracted that one right so we

139
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,820
introduced the new one that the cisco

140
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,590
juniper on our site so just the pin

141
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,460

142
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:36,199

155

157
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,860

00:09:48,890 --> 00:10:03,860
men so Greg actually again sorry for the

167
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,870
conflicts this has been a kind of a

168
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,910
conflict in week I'm gonna take it to

169
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,050
the list again to just ask a request for

170
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,280
working groups that we have the peoples

171
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,709
are participating in so we can try to

172
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:17,720
get that that list cleaned up all right

173
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:37,850
thanks Greg yes what we I just do the

174
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:40,730
PDF thing rather than it works so got

175
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:45,710
the comments reviewing comments from

176
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:49,220
awara and we discussed it worked on it I

177
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:52,520
worked on them some suggestions were

178
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:57,070
very straightforward and it was easy for

179
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,420
me to make changes and some questions

180
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:05,600
they're coming to the working group and

181
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:09,290
actually our Senate document back to us

182
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,480
so we need to discuss this chain how to

183
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,160
change the document and how we proceed

184
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:20,620
so some comments that were easy to

185
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:23,930
address as to make RFC 83 to anyone

186
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,230
which is on describing ultimate

187
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,660
marketing method and experience that

188
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:34,459
Telecom Italia has with use

189
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:37,680
it from information of the normative

190
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:40,979
references we have the discussion about

191
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,229
their use of terminology and packet

192
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:47,370
network performance monitoring which

193
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:52,769
might be nice term but in 8321 it's used

194
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:57,480
only once so we agreed to use marking

195
00:11:52,769 --> 00:12:01,920
method the question was about one of

196
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:09,629
examples that is in the draft that says

197
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:15,000
that if the head already marks the

198
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:19,589
packets and there some nodes the afar's

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,709
are monitoring so the narrative goes

200
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:27,060
that it says okay it's easy to start

201
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:29,128
monitoring in other nodes yes it's not

202
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:35,420
that easy because there's needs to be

203
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:39,149
some instructions given to node to set

204
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:45,810
certain probably ACLs or something to

205
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:49,050
start monitoring for the markings but

206
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,469
the idea was that basically from the

207
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,508
head there is nothing to do so it's only

208
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:59,130
dynamically enabling or disabling the

209
00:12:54,509 --> 00:13:04,019
monitoring point that I think that it

210
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:06,689
was addressed over I suggested to add

211
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:12,990
operation of consideration section it's

212
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:15,870
added but it might not be up to level

213
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:22,189
because the question is outstanding from

214
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:25,980
alvera is that can we can the document

215
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:29,759
provide more specific recommendations in

216
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:35,660
terms of parameters of this coloring

217
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:37,710
blocks and frequency of measuring delay

218
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,630
and

219
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,750
purity section yeah Security section was

220
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:45,060
really weak and just plain wrong I

221
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:49,980
apologize for that

222
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:54,030
so the question is that whether there is

223
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,980
a integrity protection and as far as I

224
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,199
know the alternate marking method does

225
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,950
not have integrity protection actually

226
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:06,330
the idea and go of alternate marking

227
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:10,580
method is to have as minimum footprint

228
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:14,520
as possible as I mentioned some of

229
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,620
questions and comments not addressed and

230
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:22,470
they require working group consideration

231
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:23,670
can we go to the next page please oh no

232
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:29,820
yes

233
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:35,520
yeah open delicious so the track 8321 is

234
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:40,710
experimental and experimental it for the

235
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:48,560
reason because Telecom Italia way of

236
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:50,370
implementing it in IP they used space of

237
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,489
differentiated services called

238
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:57,300
pourraient field and only in their

239
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:01,790
network so basically it's non-standard

240
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:06,079
and ipv4 doesn't have a good way of

241
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,079
supporting alternate marking method

242
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:18,990
because of status of 8321 so i wanna

243
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,650
raise the question why this document is

244
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:26,840
an a standard track and since we don't

245
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:30,120
have reports of implementation and

246
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:34,770
deployment of alternate marking methods

247
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:38,040
other than Telecom Italia recorded in

248
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:40,380
RFC so whether it should be experimental

249
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,030
or informational and that's something

250
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,500
for the working group to discuss in the

251
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:50,699
side another question is

252
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,800
we do have beer om requirements document

253
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:59,240
which was already a working group West

254
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:02,010
called and clearly this draft on

255
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,950
applicability of marking method in beer

256
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:09,630
is to address some of the requirements

257
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,570
Gregg quick question before its kids

258
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:17,040
escapes my mom for them for the marking

259
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:22,950
has all the IP are being disclosed yes

260
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:25,920
thanks so and the question is if we are

261
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,500
progressing this document why there om

262
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:34,219
requirements is not progressed at least

263
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,220
in the step with it am I correct

264
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,970
do you want to go one question at a time

265
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,770
or do you want to just go through the

266
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,450
whole slide and come back or actually

267
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:51,660
and that's I think this is the last

268
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:54,450
slide you just want to okay my

269
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:57,390
understanding is that I want to inform

270
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,830
the community about this discussion even

271
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,860
though the discussion was in the mailing

272
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:05,090
list as a summary because I don't know

273
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,380
if we can reach the decision here so I

274
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:11,699
it would be great if we can reach the

275
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,890
decision here my expectation I came to

276
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,810
the meeting with expectation that we

277
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,450
might start the discussion but their

278
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,760
final decision will be made on the list

279
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:23,840
and it's probably will have to go for

280
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:28,020
another working group West called that I

281
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,659
don't know this chef as chair asking my

282
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,400
boss man over there what we're producing

283
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,170
our specifications right the

284
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,520
requirements talk is often I look it as

285
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,100
being a working document for the group

286
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,020
it's not always needed to go all the way

287
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,570
to publications just use through the

288
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,970
process so if there's something in there

289
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,790
we need to reference directly then maybe

290
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,100
we need to progress it I would prefer to

291
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,500
dress that in this dock and move it as a

292
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,540
solution right so specific to that

293
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,420
comment that's why because the three

294
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,409
points there are independent so that's

295
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,220
why I was asking that you want to go

296
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,880
question my question

297
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,900
but when I was reviewing this hey you

298
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,220
know my other things that go check the

299
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,750
mailing list and other stuff and that I

300
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,780
follow available is that requirements

301
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,400
draft and I thought well this one that

302
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,289
it's tried to solve an away in problem

303
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,570
doesn't even talked about the

304
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:19,860
requirements raft doesn't even say there

305
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:25,918
is a requirements raft over there right

306
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:28,350
and then I think remember correctly it

307
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,919
went through last call or some state

308
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:35,730
like that

309
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:37,530
so my question too great I think was you

310
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,539
know what is relationship now his

311
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,460
initial answer was okay oh we meet

312
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,740
requirements 2 & 4 or something along

313
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,289
those but there are like 14 requirements

314
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,360
so of course the next question is well

315
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:49,740
what about the other requirements if the

316
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,178
working group agreed whether we

317
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,460
published the requirements document or

318
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,140
not is relevant but if the working for

319
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:01,380
agreed on a set of requirements for OEM

320
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,679
and we only support two or I can answer

321
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,990
it

322
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,990
III think that I try to answer my

323
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,460
question about the relationship I don't

324
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,860
think we necessarily need to publish the

325
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,140
requirements I agree all my question was

326
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,360
is if we already agreed on a set of

327
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,159
requirements maybe we should say

328
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,678
something about why we don't address

329
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,539
some maybe they don't apply or you know

330
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,159
whatever it is yeah I'll have to go back

331
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,480
and read them all to give you a solid

332
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:26,340
answer but it would seem to me that

333
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,260
especially with OEM requirements there's

334
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,178
not going to be one tool to solve all

335
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,549
these requirements right this is a tool

336
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:35,130
that solved a few and maybe we if if the

337
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:37,408
document is gonna stand as a list for us

338
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,720
to accomplish and complete then maybe we

339
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,059
should continue with it reference those

340
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,650
pieces as the tools are developed and

341
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,720
then we can finish our list right and

342
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,880
the other question related to that was

343
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,620
that because it looked and I have to go

344
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,090
look again it looked like that

345
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,760
requirements draft may have been through

346
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,959
working through bus call and so I wasn't

347
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,429
sure if the intent was to publish or not

348
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,110
so in my opinion is that if we are going

349
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:02,400
to publish the requirements draft I

350
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,320
agree with you that we don't necessarily

351
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,520
need you but if we are going to publish

352
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,439
it as an RFC

353
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,730
it makes sense to me that the

354
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,590
requirements of these are published at

355
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,149
the same time as a solution not after

356
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,199
because then after that has no real

357
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:16,139
value

358
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,450
usual result problem right the real or

359
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,480
chiral Valley so that's just sort of a

360
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,600
process timing thing that we need to

361
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,760
worry about so again is chair Antonio

362
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,379
disagrees but I've often looked at the

363
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,200
requirements documents is something to

364
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,820
keep open until complete its trouble in

365
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,800
an OEM case where we have a tool that

366
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,540
solves a couple of them knowing it's not

367
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,120
going to be one tool solves all solution

368
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,590
we'd like to see that thing progress but

369
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,149
there may be requirements that come up

370
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,409
along the way they get exposed that

371
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,640
we're because we're just developing an

372
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,170
architecture and starting to finalise

373
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,020
this stuff it seems a little premature

374
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,700
to publish that one now and one tool

375
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,720
addresses only a couple Melissa so yeah

376
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,180
that's why I was asking what's the

377
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,560
relationship and as you said you know we

378
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,050
don't necessarily need to make that

379
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,850
requirements locked in an RFC when you

380
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,940
say keep it open to me it sounds like

381
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,320
you can keep working on the draft and

382
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,650
sure you can reference the draft from

383
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,320
the RFC s as informational and that's it

384
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,670
right the draft is so why I encouraged

385
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:18,240
the requirements on the OEM site

386
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:20,760
initially very strongly is because we

387
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,480
have no tradition of publishing good OAM

388
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,460
on our technologies okay and this is no

389
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,910
major carrier stuff and I think we have

390
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,830
to shift this culture and then having

391
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,230
these requirements not being contested

392
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,020
because there's so many OEM things right

393
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,820
models what you could do could lead to

394
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,260
some productive work rather than go and

395
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,129
argue once you know a couple of

396
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,440
competing OEM things have materialized

397
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,460
now where the information should be the

398
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,590
requirement should be published

399
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,330
informational I don't think so because

400
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,679
you have a good template to go and beat

401
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,840
other people over the head and says like

402
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,190
that's type of Oh am i want you to bake

403
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,879
into the next technology that we can

404
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,200
deliver the stuff solid but you know

405
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,800
whether you see any value in that on

406
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:10,320
alternates our job is to deliver and

407
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:13,919
carry a great Oh a.m. with beer or for

408
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,710
beer whatever yeah so that's I consider

409
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,780
that a nice vehicle and publishing and

410
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,760
documenting that allows people

411
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,760
historically to track back right what

412
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,620
we're up to and which tools can do what

413
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,940
but yeah I mean we can also skip it and

414
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:32,100
just hear the tools

415
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:34,440
fine with me and we could Greg again we

416
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,469
could progress with a like I said

417
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,640
informational reference to the draft and

418
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,050
then at some point make a decision

419
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,930
whether we move that draft forward to it

420
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:48,659
if we concluded all those requirements

421
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:51,360
with tools would that make sense yes and

422
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,420
maybe not the reason I'm saying that is

423
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,679
that if we ended up with five tools or

424
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,160
whatever that solved most of the

425
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,070
requirements and now we're just

426
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,560
documenting that for posterity I don't

427
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,760
know if we need to if we couldn't meet

428
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,679
all the requirements with the five tools

429
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,629
and there's you know some other stuff as

430
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,820
Tony said that maybe we want for the

431
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,770
future for someone to look at in three

432
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:18,210
years or whatever then maybe it makes

433
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:19,320
more sense to to put that in an RC but I

434
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,170
think that's something that we probably

435
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,210
need to circle back as we go along

436
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,700
because I agree with you that once you

437
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:30,000
said that if there are other requires

438
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,340
that come back then that come in maybe

439
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,910
it's not time now to publish that draft

440
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,350
and that's fine I just don't want to

441
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,420
publish a draft that says your

442
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,439
requirements and the solutions that

443
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,580
solve all these requirements were

444
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,350
already popped that is what seems to not

445
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,639
make a lot of sense if there are

446
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,909
substantive requirements that's a

447
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,790
different that's just commented that a

448
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,590
bit seems that may be more of a semantic

449
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,690
argument I mean the OEM requirements

450
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,580
document started first we worked from it

451
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,980
developing these tools just because the

452
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,990
publishing process was out of order

453
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,110
doesn't mean the process was out of

454
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,110
order

455
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,350
right it's a perception and says from

456
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,490
the ounce that I made look like that

457
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,840
happened just because of date of

458
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,340
publication but clearly we know in the

459
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,080
IETF documents did begin that

460
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,730
publication date right I mean there's

461
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,710
just a waste of other resources later

462
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,030
because we need the operations and

463
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,740
security and everyone else will review

464
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:26,210
the draft and the iesg and all this

465
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,790
stuff for something that we already know

466
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,110
was used I guess or oh I see right right

467
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,190
that would be a brutal process

468
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,449
regardless we've already been through

469
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,630
right and then we're gonna have you know

470
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:38,520
27 or not 27 13 and other 80s abstain of

471
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,090
the document because we're republished

472
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,760
all the solutions for that

473
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:46,570
so I think that I would rather either

474
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,690
publish the requirements at the same

475
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,250
time of the solutions or if as Tony said

476
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,860
there are requirements outstanding there

477
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,510
are left for the future then we can you

478
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,520
know supposed to then and call those up

479
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,200
and say you know we solve all these

480
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,370
things but then there's there's these

481
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,260
other important things that we haven't

482
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,719
solved there we still need salt but

483
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,340
right now then then the tools that get

484
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,170
published should not reference the draft

485
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:13,000
in that case with a reference with

486
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,660
informative reference saying what if the

487
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,920
draft expires that's and then if new

488
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,220
requirements come up we resurrect the

489
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,380
draft sounds good I like that room and

490
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,970
that makes sense because I sorry I was

491
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,650
standing on the line for I know but I'm

492
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,540
referring to his conversation still so

493
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,960
can we did that make sense to people in

494
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,370
the room

495
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,020
nods hands okay do people agree that

496
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,810
that's a reasonable process to go

497
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,010
forward to publish the tools keep the

498
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:43,450
draft open we can reference it normative

499
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,260
informative excuse me foundational thank

500
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,750
you

501
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,750
informative and what it expired doesn't

502
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:53,770
progress we can resurrect it if needed

503
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:55,000
yeah anyone agree with that anyone

504
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,500
disagree with that I have a different

505
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,330
I'm standing here on the line to say

506
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,670
that I completely disagree right I think

507
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,370
it is a you know not helpful for

508
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,960
furthering you know work in the ITF when

509
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,030
the stuff that ultimately people are

510
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,770
referring to to understand why the heck

511
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,280
is are these protocols doing all these

512
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:13,990
crazy things are is seen by the iesg as

513
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,570
second-class citizens and the process

514
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,220
that we're doing right in my case in the

515
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,110
animal working group was also you don't

516
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,910
the architectures you don't do what

517
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,459
requirements documents in the end all

518
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,930
the stuff came up during iesg review of

519
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,850
a lot of the documents and all the

520
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,650
explanations went and bloated up

521
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,389
specifications which is worse than what

522
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,640
we have here which is perfectly fine

523
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,590
standalone documents that are run in

524
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,870
parallel sometimes the explanation of

525
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,970
why these things that these protocols

526
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,560
are doing are needed to take longer than

527
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,720
actually coming up with the protocols

528
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,730
themselves and and somebody comes oh

529
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,710
you're too late right you should have

530
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,050
finished all these requirements in

531
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,280
detail before these protocol bits were

532
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,139
developed I'm sorry but I'm on

533
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,350
completely the opposite side of El burro

534
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,960
and

535
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,840
this one and sorry I came I told the

536
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,049
second I'm not I haven't read this I'm

537
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,610
not you know for this specific this is

538
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,470
just very in general my bitching about

539
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,510
you know requirements documents being

540
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,820
seen as something uh sorry we already

541
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,110
got too much to do go away so let me

542
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,080
just interject we're discussing now is

543
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:16,418
IETF process more than the working group

544
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,360
process so one more than we gotta move

545
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:21,429
this Akbar just one comment from

546
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,428
previous experience if you have

547
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:27,130
requirements or something that's

548
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:29,530
requirements like people might object to

549
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,179
classifying that as informative because

550
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,658
by its very nature it's actually

551
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:36,940
normative so again maybe if the IDI you

552
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:39,130
know supports I think it's a good thing

553
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,380
to what the ad proposes and what you

554
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,179
propose but in similar circumstances

555
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,860
we've run into problems when they went

556
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:46,330
to IEC and they said well you cannot

557
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,889
make something that's a requirement is

558
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:52,000
informative because it goes against

559
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:54,100
great and Laura thought I talking more

560
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,820
about IETF process I think it depends on

561
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,500
how you make the reference so you can

562
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,299
get away with both now the thing is that

563
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,520
if it's normative than what that means

564
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,679
is that even if you send this for

565
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,350
publication now we'll have to wait for

566
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,330
the requirements we publish and that's

567
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,820
equivalent to what I was

568
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,870
the other alternative which is let's

569
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,418
publish everything at the same time

570
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,739
right so it's the crippling either you

571
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:18,970
send me everything at the same time or

572
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,710
you send me everything in pieces and

573
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,000
then everything gets published with an

574
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,000
RFC no but at the same time at the end

575
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:36,190
Gregor's chair that being the case then

576
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,530
the only risk would be if Newark armors

577
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,760
come up we have an addendum to the RFC

578
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:43,059
that got published in the requirements

579
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,590
draft right it's just at that points the

580
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:47,379
semantics really the process is the same

581
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,610
we just called the document right and

582
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,020
what I meant is that you can keep

583
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,379
working with the requirements draft all

584
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,600
you want and then send it later and

585
00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:01,540
because if it's normally if the other

586
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,219
RFC is gonna wait Thomas Eckert so again

587
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,230
it for a normal requirement stuff that's

588
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,820
kind of closed and seem to be finished

589
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,110
for whatever it's done

590
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,269
don't think what I wanted to say is

591
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,490
interesting but I thought that Warren

592
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:13,120
had this thing going on with a more

593
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,549
agile

594
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,178
you know document option and maybe

595
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:20,440
that's something so tomorrow at 8:30 in

596
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:28,450
the morning there's certain living

597
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:30,279
documents cite me occasion time timeout

598
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,549
on this discussion I don't see any

599
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:37,659
action items what it's so journalist or

600
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:41,730
it was marching point on this last point

601
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:47,860
on this slide okay that there the draft

602
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:55,330
currently has I am a section and I agree

603
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:56,709
with our word that it's odd because only

604
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,408
what it defines it defines

605
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:04,840
interpretation of the om field which is

606
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:08,070
a part of beer MPLS header so there are

607
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:12,399
couple questions out of this comment is

608
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:16,870
so can there be other interpretations of

609
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:22,268
om field or only once that will be

610
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:24,219
defined in a this draft and even the

611
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:28,000
protections of oil filters only in the

612
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:31,659
finest is then draft does it mean that

613
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,350
this draft updates there RFC eighty to

614
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:37,929
ninety six so in any case I am a

615
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:41,649
consideration section dozen is not

616
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:45,100
needed because if there could be other

617
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:47,320
interpretations then they do their

618
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,469
interpretations if it's the only

619
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:57,189
interpretation then we update the draft

620
00:30:50,470 --> 00:31:00,850
in Ayana has no action and then the

621
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:03,370
question of the naming the loss and

622
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:10,719
delay versus single and double marking

623
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:14,110
method that it's okay Tony

624
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,419
so if we go the route I'm kind of

625
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:18,370
agnostic that this came of multiple

626
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,890
interpretation you have to specify a

627
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,729
mechanism

628
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:26,370
how this you know the semantics are

629
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:28,320
being signaled and you can say very well

630
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:31,379
it's out-of-band configuration whatever

631
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,550
but you have to say something right and

632
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,070
that's what the draft says right now

633
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,540
there's no way to discover what you're

634
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,370
doing right you configure the two

635
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,770
endpoints and you interpret the bits

636
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,129
that way right and there was a question

637
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,780
because yes the beer header has two bits

638
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:48,960
and it says that it can be used for

639
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,899
LeAnn but doesn't hate see how the way I

640
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,120
interpret the RFC is that it's open to

641
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,180
the OM method to describe how and then

642
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,760
you agree but the way this draft was

643
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,370
written was that it was basically taking

644
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,590
ownership of those bits yes and not

645
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:08,159
leaving the room for others to use them

646
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,419
it's another Hawaii right so this

647
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,520
question to the working group is that

648
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,710
the interpretation that the bits can be

649
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,139
used by any method you know and it's

650
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,290
just a matter of configuration or

651
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,970
discovery or something or is the intent

652
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:25,860
that we were to assign those two bits to

653
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:28,610
a specific mechanism and if yes then is

654
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,050
this the mechanism Quantrill silencer

655
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:36,389
well there's no advantage to like take

656
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:38,280
ownership of those bits right okay so

657
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,910
ladies and gentlemen those are pretty

658
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,570
much you know watershed decisions here

659
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,570
for the foreseeable future

660
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:53,129
except yeah listen to these things so

661
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,360
good points came up I mean we should

662
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,650
highlight those from the minutes and

663
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,479
I'll bang those things out who's got the

664
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:02,370
minutes again where'd he go there you go

665
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:05,430
great mm-hm okay so we have to go to

666
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,260
last call again yes there's a rep yeah

667
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:10,020
which is so who's read the current

668
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:14,879
rather the draft we got three people

669
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:17,700
four people no actually I think that we

670
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,430
need to discuss it and because actually

671
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,720
all this open issues that are not

672
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:30,480
addressed before yes so basically it's a

673
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:31,779
track relationship with the requirement

674
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,139
document

675
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:38,379
and flags and again then the

676
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:40,059
relationship with the beer Heather so

677
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:41,468
seamless spiritless with a dedicated

678
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:43,479
threat an email highlighting those

679
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:45,789
issues with the intent of getting some

680
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:47,649
conclusion and revé and then we okay

681
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:49,090
then I'll start the three threads and

682
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,709
we'll go from there

683
00:33:49,090 --> 00:34:02,849
thank you thank you sorry for the

684
00:33:50,710 --> 00:34:02,849
conflict a free

685
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,960
hmm you know I have a full screen this

686
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,820
I'm in PDF mode and I get this like

687
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,230
scrollers all I get when I do that

688
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:22,570
that's it that just comes PPP mode

689
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:24,610
because I have some seems easy mode

690
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:28,330
there's a PPT mode look at that we can

691
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:32,530
switch between them decided no I have to

692
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:34,840
sign into Microsoft to use it yeah TDF

693
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,220
right that's right that's kind of where

694
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,500
I've concluded all my work and with the

695
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,199
new Windows to Microsoft tools I have to

696
00:34:38,500 --> 00:35:01,840
be online yeah so I said I'm done

697
00:34:41,199 --> 00:35:07,020
ok edit on a plane so this is an update

698
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:09,370
to the beer tethering drafts we have

699
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:13,480
they new adults you from Resident

700
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:18,520
joining us as co-author we added the

701
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:20,790
some text about the loop possible

702
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,560
looping prevention and then some other

703
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:27,640
scenarios like one for many and many

704
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:30,460
form protection I'm not helping so some

705
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,600
quickly goes through the basic idea of

706
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,030
peer telling it's in the wrong for your

707
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,500
deployments situation how do we handle

708
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:43,980
incapable routers you either get around

709
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,800
them or your tunnels through them in the

710
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,440
left picture it's that's where we get

711
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,380
around them the router X does not

712
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,110
support peer so even though going

713
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,510
through X is the best pass from our

714
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:00,490
unica's point of view because that's not

715
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,580
support beer then we'll go through be a

716
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:06,399
bar to even though the cost is higher

717
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,710
another way is the tunnel through the

718
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,830
incubo routers that's in the right

719
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:17,950
picture Nick with a nose who acts

720
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:19,720
next slide so sections six point nine

721
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,839
will be rocked and respect talks about

722
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,549
how this paneling is done automatically

723
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:30,070
I'll skip it

724
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:33,340
next slide please so paneling along it

725
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:36,130
works but may not be good enough in the

726
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:39,070
in this picture

727
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,440
imagine that okay so because there is no

728
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,600
animation here who has to imagine for a

729
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,470
moment that would be fr X that's my

730
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:51,250
exist here

731
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:54,850
so for PFR one will need to tunnel for

732
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:58,630
copies of the packet from bf bf ir 1 to

733
00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:02,319
p FR 3 4 5 6 respectively and if the

734
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,360
link between p FR 1 and roster X does

735
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,040
not have enough bandwidth then you're

736
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,100
wasting your precious bandwidth on those

737
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:13,930
replicas copies so the solution for that

738
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:18,360
is that we attach a beer perhaps to to

739
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:20,919
the router X with a local fed pipe then

740
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,220
the be a part 1 with ton of the package

741
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,950
to the B FRX just one copy and then be

742
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:31,899
our FB of our actual panel individual

743
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:38,310
copies 2 3 4 5 6 through that local fed

744
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:42,100
pipe next slide please so because that

745
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:44,529
BRX is like a stop router there so the

746
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:48,100
normal six point five a six point nine

747
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:51,940
procedure will not how will not work so

748
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:54,150
to make it easier we do some additional

749
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,040
signalling I'm going to jump to the

750
00:37:54,150 --> 00:38:00,310
alternative method there we're a basic

751
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:05,590
the PFR X signals that I'm the helper

752
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:07,600
for this router X with that other BFRs

753
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,170
will use the section six point nine

754
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:13,540
method Titano

755
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:16,810
to be a power x and b RX were the

756
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:19,110
internet on o2 other the fpr's next

757
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,110
slide please

758
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:28,940
so we had that's a simple picture there

759
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:32,960
we had attached that be FRX to the to

760
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:38,270
the Inca router but any is notice that

761
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:41,240
some bf are three four five six in the

762
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:44,200
picture they are connected to ax they

763
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:48,339
are capable beer any one of those or

764
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:53,509
multiple those could all be the helper

765
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:57,500
2x as long as the connection between the

766
00:38:53,510 --> 00:39:01,940
helper and that there helped its fat

767
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:05,210
enough so when you have their kind

768
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:08,780
situations they're signaling that I'm

769
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,910
access Harper can carry a priority so

770
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,670
that's the ones with the highest

771
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:16,339
priority is used as helper you could

772
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,589
even have multiple ones either has in

773
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:23,480
the same priority then all those could

774
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:26,420
be used in other situation is that one

775
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,270
helper could actually help not multiple

776
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,400
number efforts will have a slight later

777
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:34,819
for that

778
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,950
so with OSPF star I assess signaling the

779
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:40,240
helper needs to be in the same area or

780
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:43,549
level as num be a par that it helps

781
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,490
that's the OSPF is a signaling now I

782
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:49,579
also have a slide on how to do tethering

783
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,609
with BGP signaling later next slide

784
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:57,650
please

785
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:59,420
so you may have some concerns on

786
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,780
possible looping situation you may get

787
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:05,890
into what if BFRO and tunnels the peer

788
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,030
packet will be FRX and in somehow pfr X

789
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,308
sends a packet back to PFR why

790
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:14,230
especially if you have a direct angle

791
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:19,040
connection between VFR while I'm VFR X

792
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:23,599
so there are some simpler scenarios

793
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,880
where if you have a dedicated stop

794
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:30,559
helper that does not have any other

795
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,710
connections then you you're guaranteed

796
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:36,590
not working in the loop

797
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:39,849
or if you have helper that has other

798
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:45,619
connections for example in this picture

799
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:51,170
PF rx has connections to be a power 5 5

800
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:53,630
& 6 it's no longer a stop helper but in

801
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,970
but as long as the upper axe does not

802
00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:01,520
have connection back to the tunnel

803
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:04,220
ingress then it's also fine but you may

804
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,310
say that it's probably harder for me to

805
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,040
guarantee my topology like that and next

806
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:14,330
slide please

807
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:17,509
it turns out that it can also be

808
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:21,380
guaranteed as long as you do as your SPF

809
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:26,420
calculation niku let me jump jump to the

810
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:30,460
boat and slanted text there basically in

811
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:33,619
this picture pfr 1 when it decides

812
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:38,780
whether PFR acts can be used as a helper

813
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:44,000
it just as a SPF calculation with the

814
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:48,800
PFR PFR acts as the root even if it

815
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,589
realize that if somehow be a power X

816
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,820
would use PFR one as next hop to reach

817
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:58,910
be a power 3 then PFR 1 will not panel

818
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:02,000
Packer to be a 4x too risky a par 3 so

819
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,598
that extra calculation is actually no

820
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,570
different

821
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:11,180
it's the same as the extra calculation

822
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:14,630
you use to prevent looping in the OFA so

823
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:18,140
it's the same idea in fact you can view

824
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:23,390
the tunneling of beer from beer power 1

825
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:26,690
to P of X as LF a protection pass

826
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,940
it's just now you you always using that

827
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:32,690
protection passing stuff in so that

828
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:36,589
nature pass so that SPF calculation

829
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:38,720
routed pass the other helper is the way

830
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:41,770
to guarantee that you do not get into

831
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,209
the looping situation there's Greg

832
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,349
independent just trying to follow the

833
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,800
example I understand what you're trying

834
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:47,630
to do

835
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,950
but the example has me a bit baffled and

836
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:51,230
I don't know why that would be a problem

837
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,029
here because you're going back I mean

838
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,680
why would I go back to be afar one in

839
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,120
the first place if the bits not set for

840
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,940
that and no ingress would set its own

841
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,799
bit coming in so I only work at bfr one

842
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:04,130
was the path through X back three and

843
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,370
four it would take that path right so in

844
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:13,550
this picture imagine that the connection

845
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:20,509
between B F R 1 and b FR x has a costs

846
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:23,330
of its it's three it's the same cost

847
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:26,510
back x right but cost of beer for one

848
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:29,060
from bf4 X is now four through X + 3 / 3

849
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:31,670
if I want but why would it send anything

850
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,920
to be FR one was a bit is set for it in

851
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:37,340
this technology as long oh it's that sum

852
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,290
I think first of all or the metrics

853
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,570
there may be the metric is not the

854
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:46,009
rights to these explain the problem this

855
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:50,480
is imagine that PFR one send a packet

856
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:52,850
destined to be a BF ER 3 to be a power X

857
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,750
because b FR ax is the helper and

858
00:43:52,850 --> 00:44:00,230
somehow b FR x does its calculation

859
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,820
realize that oh that the torus PFR 3

860
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:05,810
actually have it goes through the FR 1

861
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:10,220
in that situation then yeah ok but that

862
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:11,960
extra calculation that is the same thing

863
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:19,700
we do for our fa purpose

864
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:21,820
well address this concern so when we

865
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:25,819
first came up with tethering solution

866
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:29,180
how always kind of nervous that's where

867
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:32,960
I get into looking and with this I'm

868
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,899
actually much relieved that this is

869
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:40,850
finds it's going to work out

870
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:43,970
next slide so what what if you have a

871
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:47,089
situation where you have you want to use

872
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:51,020
one helper in this case it's BF r XY in

873
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:56,790
the middle to help multiple non capable

874
00:44:51,020 --> 00:45:00,000
incapable routers x iy xn y here that is

875
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:03,029
just a special case of translators so as

876
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,430
long as you do the extra SPF calculation

877
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:08,100
and make sure that you won't get into

878
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:14,089
loops situation looping then you can use

879
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:14,089
the PFR XY to help both x and y here

880
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:25,850
this slide is about how you do the

881
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,850
signaling with bgp to do the tethering

882
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:36,570
we I had a animation in the PPP mode to

883
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:41,010
make it easier but now I'll try to

884
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:46,050
explain so if you look from the right

885
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:54,290
side of the picture PFR ER 3 4 5 6 they

886
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:58,230
advertise beer prefixes along with

887
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:02,820
Tunnel encapsulation attributes their

888
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:06,870
attributes is said to the PAPR 3 4 5 6

889
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,670
own beer critics that panel

890
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,560
encapsulation attribute basically tells

891
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:15,270
the receivers of this Eddard husband

892
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:18,750
that when you send packets to this for

893
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:22,920
this beer fear of fall for this BFE are

894
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:25,590
you send it to the BFRO

895
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,910
you know encoded as in that tunnel

896
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:32,460
encapsulation attribute so for example

897
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,529
when the when the par-3 gets that

898
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,010
announcements appear BGP at her

899
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:41,670
husband's and it gets a beer packet

900
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:46,080
destined to be aware via ferry BF ER 3

901
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:50,760
it will send the packet to P of e r3 now

902
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:58,319
VFR 3 4 5 6 continue to advertise those

903
00:46:50,760 --> 00:47:01,950
bf bf our prefixes to be FR x ya to be a

904
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:05,220
power x now this time you will change

905
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:08,000
the panel encapsulation attribute to be

906
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:10,910
across 3 4 5 6

907
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,700
peer predicts that were there with that

908
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:17,060
when the routers on the right on the

909
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,600
left side send them beer packets with

910
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,500
some kids be said for beer for ER three

911
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,569
four five six

912
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:27,160
they were just simply send the packet

913
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:31,760
through the PFR three four five six now

914
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:37,759
when X gets that advertisement it will

915
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:42,920
advertise reader has those two PFR X the

916
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:45,350
helper now this time X no longer says

917
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:49,940
itself in that paneling hydrogen

918
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:51,680
attribute instead X will set what

919
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:58,000
changed the panel encapsulation

920
00:47:51,680 --> 00:48:06,169
attribute to address of the PFR X now X

921
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:10,670
as this does the same thing with PFR one

922
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:13,430
and so on so forth so when that when the

923
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:18,320
package from be Fri are one arrives at

924
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:20,540
PFR 1bf our one war send the package to

925
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,680
be F our X because that's what the

926
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:29,840
tunnel encapsulation attribute says and

927
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:32,240
and then we have our X or or follow the

928
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,920
tunneling has a encapsulation attribute

929
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,970
and send the packet to be across three

930
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:41,030
four five six

931
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:43,790
I wish I could explain this better in

932
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:49,940
here but if you

933
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:51,620
I think our sender PT key to the email

934
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,620
to the mailing list and that way people

935
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:57,470
can convey their draft and then can can

936
00:48:54,620 --> 00:49:03,980
can follow the animation and it's easier

937
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:05,930
oh the PPD oh okay good good okay it's

938
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:11,680
just we cannot display it here okay ask

939
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:16,940
me to log into Microsoft okay thanks so

940
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:19,970
the in summary tethering be a power

941
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,680
helper will reduce the copies of tano's

942
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:25,490
packets over

943
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:29,598
scares links so it helps there are two

944
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:32,689
options to signal and the preferred

945
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,400
solution of signaling is to edit I that

946
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:41,900
helper otherwise that I'm the helper

947
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:44,059
with that then the incubo browser does

948
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,220
not need to do anything which is a good

949
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:48,290
thing because in most cases if you

950
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:52,098
cannot do PR you don't you would not

951
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:55,730
want to upgrade it for whatever reason a

952
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:57,950
software upgrade and we have some

953
00:49:55,730 --> 00:50:00,500
flexible heathering options you can have

954
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:02,569
stop helpers different transit helpers

955
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:06,920
you can run for many helper or many for

956
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:10,279
one helper and we know that if you do

957
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:12,680
the extra calculation you can you know

958
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:19,849
that when to do go through the helper or

959
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:22,339
not next slide so we continue to see

960
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:26,200
comments and the authors also believe

961
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:29,540
that the document is mature enough for

962
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,069
working group adoption so we want to

963
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,630
that request yes

964
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:35,540
thanks Jeffrey who's read the draft in

965
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,099
his current form right

966
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:42,040
I think it's who thinks it's ready for

967
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:42,040
last holdout and dachshund

968
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:51,910
have you been the first ten minutes who

969
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,440
thinks it's ready for adoption

970
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:56,540
all right so it looks like those who

971
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,119
read it or on board will take it to

972
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,410
listen Thank You Jeffrey okay thanks do

973
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,799
you have see a question

974
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:06,200
Oh Sam right this game what I didn't

975
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:10,250
read the draft so bear with me

976
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:16,669
so X in this case is going to keep the

977
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:19,430
state of all the the end points X yeah I

978
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:22,069
mean the if you go to the topology if

979
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:24,259
you go to whatever I don't know whether

980
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:29,540
we call it it's more like a proxy or

981
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:33,800
more like it can I call it proxy yeah

982
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:35,810
yes it's it's proxy but the

983
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,080
the reason we don't call proxies that

984
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:41,960
some there is already another traps with

985
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:46,250
the proxy is that it's that proxy is

986
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:52,070
really trapped it's really about so you

987
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:55,580
are realizing beer or prefixes across

988
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:58,610
areas or across protocols stat rather

989
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:01,370
already used the proxy turn so that's

990
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:05,540
why we're not using C indeed it's a the

991
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:09,380
FRX is the proxy for X okay so it's

992
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:11,840
going to keep the information what bfr

993
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:15,050
one is supposed to keep is that right

994
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:18,230
because you're tunneling to X and X will

995
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:20,210
actually going to for the packet two

996
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:23,780
different year for dogs

997
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:27,980
no BPF for the helper that does not keep

998
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:30,320
additional information except that I am

999
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:33,260
the helper our X that's the only

1000
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:37,010
additional information that's bf Iraq

1001
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:39,620
skips that way when the when the FRX

1002
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:43,550
does is calculation knows that so I'm

1003
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:44,560
not going to use X and then the other

1004
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:49,340
BFRs

1005
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:52,520
they also they only remember that pfr x

1006
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,290
is the helper for x therefore when that

1007
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,009
when for example in this picture when

1008
00:52:54,290 --> 00:53:01,779
PFR one that's the section six 96.9

1009
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:05,090
procedure instead of replacing X with

1010
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,970
access children that suppose beer it

1011
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:11,390
will simply replace X with its helper

1012
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:13,399
PFR X I system so you're in other words

1013
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,839
the whatever the advertisements the

1014
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,220
control plane is going to send to the

1015
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:20,840
VFR I r1 will remain the same right so

1016
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,770
it's not going to Rhian capsulate or

1017
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:34,970
anything of that sort

1018
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:39,020
right my corner might get a question so

1019
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:44,089
most of the examples here I see only one

1020
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:47,130
router that cannot do that is not beer

1021
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,740
capable and and we are trying to get

1022
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:53,850
around that one router so I'm just

1023
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:57,000
wondering how realistic is this in in

1024
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:59,210
like a provider network and the second

1025
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,400
part maybe would be the same token is

1026
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:04,590
let's assume that now that one router

1027
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,780
becomes a cluster of a router like a

1028
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:10,050
ring

1029
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:14,190
and we want to bypass that ring that is

1030
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:18,420
not Bill capable how will how will these

1031
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:21,810
procedures go so let me press I'll

1032
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:26,400
answer that you're very pressed crashing

1033
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:28,740
down imagine that you have a network

1034
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,580
where most of the routers do not support

1035
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:35,609
peer and those routers are like

1036
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:38,250
workhorses for unicast yeah

1037
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:41,150
it can handle tremendous amount of

1038
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:45,690
unicast traffic and but now you want to

1039
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:48,060
pierce and it's not just not feasible to

1040
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:51,600
add peer support to those routers in

1041
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:55,770
that situation in in theory you could

1042
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:59,630
attach a small PFR router to any one of

1043
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,630
them and then you can just do the

1044
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,960
tunneling through that help that that's

1045
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:09,660
in theory so you can just pick your you

1046
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,710
just look at your network and you see

1047
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:16,490
that okay even though there are many

1048
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:19,350
billion cable routers there I could

1049
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:21,990
attach a helper for every one them or I

1050
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:25,410
could just simply pick a couple or a few

1051
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:27,779
of strategic replication points attached

1052
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:33,089
help more help there so that's one way

1053
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:35,340
to do it yeah again I think it's great

1054
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:38,610
idea I'm just trying to understand like

1055
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:40,830
how far down the road to be doing this

1056
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:43,320
procedure is gonna be relevant so like

1057
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:45,509
just thinking about like a third-party

1058
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:48,780
off-the-shelf basic kind of thing which

1059
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:54,240
does a lot of throughput and doesn't do

1060
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:57,150
beer you know okay I can understand if

1061
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,450
it's top of the rack type of switch and

1062
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:01,019
and you want to bypass that and maybe

1063
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,999
this car

1064
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:06,319
in handy but it is this a type of

1065
00:56:02,999 --> 00:56:10,379
scenarios that you're thinking about no

1066
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:13,019
it's when you say Papa wreck you're

1067
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:15,119
talking about either centers yeah well

1068
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:15,839
beer exactly like a 5g data center or

1069
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,249
something like that

1070
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,619
all I'm trying to understand is like

1071
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:22,229
where is this going to come in handy any

1072
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:25,919
network where you think that you want to

1073
00:56:22,229 --> 00:56:28,259
start doing beer and is just for a short

1074
00:56:25,919 --> 00:56:31,348
term you you you don't have that every

1075
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:35,399
router that can support beer you can you

1076
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:44,579
can do it it is just a matter of how

1077
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:46,828
many helpers you want to attach what you

1078
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:51,509
telecom to your question how relevant

1079
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:54,719
this is as a co also also from from this

1080
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:57,569
draft for example in our network it's it

1081
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:59,519
is relevant if you think of the

1082
00:56:57,569 --> 00:57:02,640
brownfield approach and you have a life

1083
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:05,609
cycle of about five to eight years when

1084
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,219
once you renew the router we have done

1085
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:10,439
the calculation on our end and we see

1086
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:12,659
that we have some relatives in the

1087
00:57:10,439 --> 00:57:14,699
middle of our backbone which will not be

1088
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:18,149
being capable so the question is what do

1089
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:20,789
you do now do you do you wait until you

1090
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:25,380
have got a complete refresh cycle of oil

1091
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:28,229
routers which be a capable then then you

1092
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,630
have a very long time to cover or are

1093
00:57:28,229 --> 00:57:33,419
you looking for ways around how you can

1094
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:37,169
do for example tethering so that you

1095
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:41,219
enable in the network with with side

1096
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:43,828
machines to really gain the profit of

1097
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:49,919
fear in order to make it and the whole

1098
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:51,329
backbone via Cape just a third question

1099
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:52,769
in that case like there are two

1100
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:54,539
scenarios here there is a tethering

1101
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:57,689
scenario and there is a scenario that we

1102
00:57:54,539 --> 00:58:00,779
go away from the non beer capable so

1103
00:57:57,689 --> 00:58:02,879
going away from non Butte get all that

1104
00:58:00,779 --> 00:58:05,009
that completely makes me you know put a

1105
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,719
router that is pure K for all your

1106
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:08,729
unicast goes over the one that is not

1107
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,789
there and your multicast goes over the

1108
00:58:08,729 --> 00:58:15,020
one that is beer capable the one that is

1109
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:18,300
for title tethering which actually

1110
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:21,930
tunnels the beer through whatever LDP sr

1111
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:25,320
or whatever it is so in that case you're

1112
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:32,129
saying that the router so there's no way

1113
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:36,570
to put a be a capable router beside you

1114
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:42,210
just can't bypass it right quick comment

1115
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:44,040
down to a human if if you want to get

1116
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:47,220
around the income of routers then you

1117
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,100
still need to ensure that eventually you

1118
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:53,459
have a connected graph for other the

1119
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:56,339
rich or the B F ers and sometimes you

1120
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,530
may not be able to put in those

1121
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:01,350
additional connections you can put a

1122
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:03,240
router in there but you may or may not

1123
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,860
have an extra fiber or connection for

1124
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,100
that with the tethering

1125
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,690
as long as you have a local fed pipe to

1126
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,490
the between the help rather than the

1127
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:15,870
helped then address will just work out

1128
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,470
we shall leave no move up for you right

1129
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:20,520
okay

1130
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:22,589
the Sun is only he my question is I just

1131
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:26,550
admitted the newest version of this

1132
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:30,000
draft and I found that there are two no

1133
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:33,600
two type of node is defined in the draft

1134
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,830
helper note under help know that right

1135
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:42,690
and it reminds me the PTP feature for

1136
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:45,180
grace for restart and the only the node

1137
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:48,930
who will help to other know that will

1138
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:53,299
send this a future of helper but no

1139
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:57,480
one's then is a helped tutor for it so

1140
00:59:53,300 --> 01:00:01,320
I'm just wondering if we should define

1141
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:08,450
only one type of it just however not

1142
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:10,800
helped so for the first comment now yes

1143
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:14,399
there is a helper and then there's helps

1144
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:16,980
I remember when it come to a signaling I

1145
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,730
said I said there are two way to

1146
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:24,460
advertise the helping information that

1147
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:30,430
the second one I am the helper of X

1148
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:32,680
that with that you that that the help

1149
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:34,950
the router that the one who does not

1150
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:40,540
appear does not need to do anything

1151
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:43,149
it's just ignorant how anything and

1152
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:50,430
everything is handled by the PF ours and

1153
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:56,230
the PPF apfr helpers so does that answer

1154
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:59,859
answer your question or no twitch can't

1155
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:02,080
support beer he will not send a pure

1156
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:05,710
perfect other information associated

1157
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:08,410
with the IDP OPP extension right so we

1158
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:13,000
know that this node account support we

1159
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:17,589
are already and we can also think this

1160
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:21,000
node need help right right the thing is

1161
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:23,500
that if you look at this picture here

1162
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,890
even though this is BGP you'll spoke

1163
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:32,070
about this is about BGP so the here X

1164
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:34,359
does not say anything and pfr one

1165
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:39,820
following the existing six-point-nine

1166
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:42,600
procedure if you were you will realize

1167
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:45,460
that okay X does not support peer

1168
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:48,279
therefore for PFP are three four five

1169
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:49,740
six I will have the tunnel to be a par

1170
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,110
three four five six

1171
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:55,330
crossbow Nene and that will work but it

1172
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:57,700
does not work well because PFR one needs

1173
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:59,980
with tunnel for copies through X now

1174
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:04,600
with the additional other hidin from VFR

1175
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:09,520
X saying that I am helping X than PFR

1176
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:13,630
one will say that okay now instead of

1177
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,580
replacing X with PFR three four five six

1178
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:18,340
following the section six point nine

1179
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:21,100
procedure I will just simply replace X

1180
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:26,520
with P FRX with the helper so that's the

1181
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:29,470
that's the trick here are we gonna

1182
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,380
really behind here so you did the neck

1183
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,089
OH

1184
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:36,290
I guess we dressed this all the way down

1185
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:39,350
the other question is to address this so

1186
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:42,259
I in the discussion where's the DT guy

1187
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:45,049
that we agree on whom is questions as

1188
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,910
well maybe an example that shows

1189
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:48,680
incremental deployment as opposed to the

1190
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:50,450
tail end of the deployment right like

1191
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,850
I've got a couple modes I can put in and

1192
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:54,589
the majority of my network has not how

1193
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:56,060
would this tool migrate as opposed to

1194
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:58,640
because it because the snare is like one

1195
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,529
lock left node as opposed to a couple of

1196
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,500
EUR nodes and everything else not I knew

1197
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:05,450
was that would that be like a valuable

1198
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,500
human would that be valuable to the to

1199
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,970
the draft that we showed that

1200
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:17,990
incremental deployment is supposed to

1201
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:19,370
like the tail end right I think clearly

1202
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:20,930
these questions are coming up so if it's

1203
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:23,990
looked at as being transitional would

1204
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:27,669
show that path would be all right all

1205
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:30,290
right next I don't get out of this I

1206
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:33,530
found the button so I'm making progress

1207
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:35,529
here oh by the way I just found this

1208
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:37,790
slide doomed if you have PowerPoint

1209
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,680
documents they need to be converted to

1210
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:51,950
Google slides and just all of these

1211
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:53,569
simple instructions this is but this was

1212
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:55,279
at my desk right here right so

1213
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:57,560
apparently I'm supposed to do this to

1214
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,300
allow you to animate for every deck

1215
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,970
it's just let you know this is not gonna

1216
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,890
happen up here but if you need this

1217
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:05,330
stuff maybe we should all go to Google

1218
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:06,980
slides instead and then we'll be a quick

1219
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:10,460
quick move thanks

1220
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:17,120
all right next is signaling over beer

1221
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:18,560
this is ml DP not ml d I did the same

1222
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:23,509
thing of a mailing list when I saw the

1223
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:27,440
the requests come up there one letter

1224
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:30,680
difference between them so this is the

1225
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:34,580
second try for the MLB signaling over

1226
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:37,850
beer the previous draft that we had I

1227
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:39,529
think there were some concerns about the

1228
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:41,569
way that the signaling was down so we

1229
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,040
retrieved it and here's a new way of

1230
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:45,710
doing it

1231
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:50,570
that the main problem is the same right

1232
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:52,730
so we are trying to segment of the

1233
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:55,100
network we are trying to go to beer

1234
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:59,240
brand new hardware that can support beer

1235
01:04:55,100 --> 01:05:03,799
and we got all these access or legacy

1236
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:06,560
multicast part parts of the network that

1237
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:10,340
they want to be communicating over this

1238
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:12,250
new beer let's call it a core and we

1239
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:17,320
want to make this happen

1240
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:20,660
excuse me with minimum disruption or

1241
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:24,550
software upgrade on these legacy

1242
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:26,899
multicast networks so next slide please

1243
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:31,040
so now the way that we're gonna do this

1244
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:35,480
is via RFC 7060 we're gonna try to

1245
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:39,140
connect the two ml DP Islands together

1246
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:43,160
over the beer we are signaling TL DP

1247
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:45,680
through the beer core so literally

1248
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:48,259
you're gonna be seeing the TL VP packets

1249
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,609
on the beer core they're not being

1250
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,930
tunneled or anything like that tree the

1251
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:55,700
beer you're gonna see the signaling

1252
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:58,279
going from the IBB are today eb b r and

1253
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,009
they're gonna signal the and all deep

1254
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:03,710
effects through the core of the beer

1255
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:06,610
core one thing you gotta keep in mind is

1256
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:10,940
that usually MLBPA as everybody knows is

1257
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:13,670
in a d u mode with the TLD P it's gonna

1258
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:18,260
be downstream on demand meaning that I

1259
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:21,170
PBR when it gets effect from the from

1260
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:24,140
the receiver will actually ask from the

1261
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:28,130
label from the upstream router and of a

1262
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:32,600
stream router which is the egress bbr pH

1263
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:36,880
router will assign that label to the to

1264
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:41,299
the downstream router next slide please

1265
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:44,300
so from procedure point of view again on

1266
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:48,930
the ib b r is very simple when ml DP

1267
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:52,080
fake arrives on the ib b are we find

1268
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:55,339
eld possession to the other beer edge

1269
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:58,650
router at the way that we find that

1270
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:02,120
egress beer edge router is via

1271
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:04,400
procedures described in RFC 76 II or

1272
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:09,150
procedures that are already in the draft

1273
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:15,120
ITF PM signaling so those procedures on

1274
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:19,020
the IP BR will actually identify the

1275
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:22,799
egress beer router now the egress B

1276
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:28,320
router again it's the last router that

1277
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:30,500
supports beer B floor the root note on

1278
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:35,390
the point-to-multipoint

1279
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:40,230
LSP next our next slide please

1280
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:44,870
so on the ebbr on the BBB are basically

1281
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:49,260
the procedure is when these facts arrive

1282
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:51,960
from the IBB are the ebbr needs to track

1283
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:56,580
all these facts the reason that it needs

1284
01:07:51,960 --> 01:08:00,200
to track the facts is for the same facts

1285
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:02,670
it needs to be built at beer header

1286
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:07,680
basically the same story as PIM

1287
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:10,800
signalling and also the ebbr as it was

1288
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:14,430
mentioned before it assigns the other

1289
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:17,420
stream label so there are multiple ways

1290
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:20,490
of doing that but we feel that that

1291
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:23,840
assignment needs to be unique throughout

1292
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:28,679
the entire beer domain and that's why

1293
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:34,650
the draft MVP an EVP an aggregation

1294
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:37,490
label which uses like unique upstream

1295
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:42,750
label assignment it will come in handy

1296
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:45,330
in these procedures are also so next

1297
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:48,090
slide please so when it comes from the

1298
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:51,059
other pad perspective as when the packet

1299
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:54,420
comes back from the root with the MPLS

1300
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:56,880
label it arrives on the ebbr the ebbr

1301
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:59,160
will do a swap with the label that it

1302
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,650
has assigned for all the downstream

1303
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,439
labels with the same token it's going to

1304
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:07,149
look at all

1305
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:09,549
the PFE ours that are interested in this

1306
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:12,028
fake based on that information it's

1307
01:09:09,549 --> 01:09:14,500
gonna push the beer header on top of it

1308
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:17,310
we are thinking that the beer header

1309
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:22,569
protocol prototype protocol should be an

1310
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:27,730
MPLS so the BF ER can identify that beer

1311
01:09:22,569 --> 01:09:31,509
packet as an MPLS payload and actually

1312
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:34,809
removed the beer header look at the MPLS

1313
01:09:31,509 --> 01:09:38,069
label underneath do a swap with the

1314
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:41,290
label that is relevant on the leaf

1315
01:09:38,069 --> 01:09:48,339
domain if you will and then forward the

1316
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:50,799
packet through the second MPLS Island if

1317
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:55,380
you will access Island and that's how

1318
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:55,380
the data path works next slide please

1319
01:09:56,699 --> 01:10:01,750
yeah so the next step for this is you

1320
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,380
know we definitely want

1321
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:08,050
comments on this draft any questions

1322
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:13,900
comments and we are hoping to ask for

1323
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:16,170
working group allocation who thinks this

1324
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:18,670
should be adopted his working group item

1325
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,420
solid support from those who read let's

1326
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:22,300
take it to the list

1327
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:23,830
thank you very much we are really behind

1328
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,120
so I'm going to start putting stuff

1329
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:26,769
through this sorry but that was a good

1330
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:33,070
discussion especially the operators

1331
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:35,199
community thank you give me a third

1332
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:43,870
minute 30 minutes I'll regret at all all

1333
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:51,759
right next is HTTP Dirk yes all right

1334
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:55,030
hi should be a quick one okay so so this

1335
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,100
was an update to the micros overlay for

1336
01:10:55,030 --> 01:11:02,769
adaptive streaming services since the

1337
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:04,930
last idea of 104 we've you know we have

1338
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:07,150
a use case of expanded comes to the next

1339
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:08,260
one we ever the the trough shows the

1340
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:11,259
reference architecture and the

1341
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:14,410
realization of the multicast overlay in

1342
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:16,270
over IP MC but also over beer as a

1343
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:17,710
comparison if you will

1344
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:20,800
and the pros and cons for both are

1345
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:22,390
described in the draft and for the

1346
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,700
realization of a beer we provide the

1347
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:26,440
operational details for elements like

1348
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,490
the you know the PC service hand etc

1349
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:33,219
that are introduced in the reference

1350
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:36,969
architecture next one piece as a recap

1351
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:39,250
the the yellow ones are the application

1352
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:41,560
elements in that are described in the

1353
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:43,210
draft and the red elements are the

1354
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,100
elements that are introduced by the

1355
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:48,010
reference architecture for the for the

1356
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:50,890
use case meaning the the service center

1357
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:54,880
as well as the PC and the multicast

1358
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:57,040
overlays then formed by the IR and the

1359
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,450
yours of the beer layer and the service

1360
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,550
handler is performing the additional

1361
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:03,790
operations for the actual arm streaming

1362
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:05,950
service of the of the use cases to the

1363
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:07,780
next piece the details that we've

1364
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:10,599
changed compared to the previous version

1365
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:12,370
is that we added a second category so we

1366
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,400
focus initially on the HTTP based

1367
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:17,380
streaming use case where we added a

1368
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,410
description of - in there I guess that's

1369
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:22,540
the realization in one of the examples

1370
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:24,910
but we also added another use case for

1371
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:27,160
HTTP based software updates that's been

1372
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:29,170
added in the new version - just have two

1373
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:32,290
different categories of HTTP based

1374
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:34,090
services and we also added an enhanced

1375
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:37,150
the security considerations to address a

1376
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:39,190
comment from the Beavers ITF on the HTTP

1377
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:40,929
based exchanges so since either the the

1378
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:42,820
certificate handling is being included

1379
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:46,450
in that section these are really the

1380
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:49,059
changes since the last time so next

1381
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:52,330
steps is well first I would like to have

1382
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:53,260
comments and really you know people you

1383
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:55,059
know reading the traffic avoiding

1384
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:57,880
comments back and from our perspective

1385
01:12:55,060 --> 01:13:00,640
you know we have finished with a details

1386
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:04,630
and so would be asking for last call for

1387
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:07,240
this draw specifically looking one was

1388
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,810
on one on one published it was just

1389
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,540
after

1390
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:11,950
Prague then right yes yeah yeah it was a

1391
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,840
quick update it wasn't very clean update

1392
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:17,530
all right who's read the draft in its

1393
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,890
current form you're an author all right

1394
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:22,960
who thinks it's ready for last call yeah

1395
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:25,120
I get soft response couple hands went

1396
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,920
down we can listen let's take you the

1397
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,800
lists open thread and yeah again going

1398
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,570
last call is often just a stick in the

1399
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,690
nest to get you

1400
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:34,889
read it and respond right so I'm gonna

1401
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:37,110
put it in the queue with these I've got

1402
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:39,840
going but we need to respond to this

1403
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:51,179
week in progress okay thanks thank you

1404
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:55,640
very much okay next beam tour list have

1405
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:55,640
you seen this guy he has no tour none

1406
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:23,010
your socks hex light oh I'm sorry we

1407
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:24,750
have a meeting ok so right so this isn't

1408
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:26,190
working group last call you heard the

1409
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,990
working group chair please read it

1410
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:30,629
please provide feedback we really want

1411
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:33,840
to get it out to ISJ right just few more

1412
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:36,570
voices and so we thought that we read it

1413
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,520
ourselves that some of the past comments

1414
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:41,429
were this is of obviously it's somewhat

1415
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:44,190
difficult technology so we added text to

1416
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:46,740
a better I think get started in reading

1417
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:48,990
it in the beginning so next slide so

1418
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:51,059
improve the abstract right so basically

1419
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:52,830
even though we introduced beauty

1420
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:55,110
obviously everybody knows what traffic

1421
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:57,000
engineering is no and of perfected

1422
01:14:55,110 --> 01:15:00,179
stateless strict and loose path engineer

1423
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,550
replication forwarding right using peer

1424
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:04,530
packets call that beauty the basic

1425
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:06,420
examples I'm going to show and then

1426
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:08,910
basically we edit how this topology

1427
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:10,620
think that the basic example show comes

1428
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:12,870
into picture in the architecture and

1429
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:14,640
then also for people coming from this

1430
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:17,059
world of segments routing you know

1431
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,400
trying to find some way on how to upsell

1432
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:22,830
beauty to them in their terminology okay

1433
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,799
so this is the basic example right is

1434
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:28,080
the first one on this slide is showing

1435
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:30,660
hop-by-hop native so to speak these are

1436
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:33,300
all layer two adjacencies forwarded you

1437
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:36,000
see the full be ifts of all the routers

1438
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,860
and then the text one page or so walks

1439
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,170
through the forwarding of an individual

1440
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:43,290
packet how each bloody bits does its

1441
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:44,380
work at each other so next slide same

1442
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:46,269
thing overlay

1443
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,010
so basically we've removed two of these

1444
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:50,410
routers from beer they're not beer

1445
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:52,180
capable so now you've got forward routed

1446
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:54,550
adjacencies before between the four

1447
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:57,550
remaining ones comparison also how the

1448
01:15:54,550 --> 01:16:00,000
bits react and basically those are the

1449
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:02,350
two type of you know extreme beauty

1450
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,910
topologies we can think of a native one

1451
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:07,060
and overlay you can have any combination

1452
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:09,430
that's what the examples in this new

1453
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:11,950
introduction part say so and that

1454
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:13,900
basically means in the in the

1455
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:16,240
architecture paper it's really the

1456
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,650
beauty controller host read/write so the

1457
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,050
controller discovers the network

1458
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:22,269
topology and out of that it creates

1459
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:25,120
whatever thinks is the best beer to eat

1460
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:27,610
apology overlay native combination and

1461
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,470
the rest is obviously all was already

1462
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:32,440
there but this particular piece of

1463
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:34,090
explanation hopefully you know few more

1464
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,549
people reading it with this new text

1465
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:39,510
understanding it saying great right so

1466
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:45,520
that's what we're trying to do please

1467
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:47,010
last light right so then oh there was

1468
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,110
the word Tecna drought we missing in the

1469
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:53,050
in the title here on the slide sorry so

1470
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:55,150
yeah so basically the be peace in in the

1471
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:56,530
sense of segment routing can really be

1472
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:58,629
seen as equivalent of forwarding

1473
01:16:56,530 --> 01:17:00,340
segments except that you can't take a

1474
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:02,020
bit position you know and think oh it's

1475
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:03,970
a global thing I can send from it from

1476
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:06,430
anywhere because the whole trick of how

1477
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:09,550
to steer things through it is that only

1478
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:11,370
you know the adjacent nodes have this

1479
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:13,870
bit and replicate to it right so

1480
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:17,170
basically maybe in this terminology we

1481
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:18,970
call these beer te bits adjacency scope

1482
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:20,800
forwarding segments right so I mean it's

1483
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:23,470
just more food for thought on how you

1484
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,480
see it I'm also saying that SRK

1485
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:27,280
naturally be combined with beer te and

1486
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:30,610
help to optimize it right when everyone

1487
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:33,790
is deal without replication SRS fine the

1488
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:36,370
whole point of beer te of course is to

1489
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:38,260
steer and replicate right and then the

1490
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:40,210
last one which I think more people from

1491
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:43,300
just the beer side may have an opinion

1492
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:46,110
about is that you know you can also see

1493
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:49,210
that here itself you know kind of just

1494
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:50,950
destination sit with a fashion

1495
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:54,220
replication right instead of having a

1496
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:57,059
long list of egress it's in a packet and

1497
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:59,250
replicating on that well every set is

1498
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:02,280
you know compress to one bit so that was

1499
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:03,750
kind of you know this can all be removed

1500
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,210
if people don't like to be compared with

1501
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:08,790
us are right this we're just hoping it's

1502
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:13,800
helpful to bring people to beer and

1503
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:16,920
that's it the end Wow even conclusion

1504
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,810
that's kind of cute let's take that

1505
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:21,300
delicious of the response we took this

1506
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:23,880
to a last call before we had to people

1507
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,920
said it was ready for last call but

1508
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,810
we've wrapped since cleaning some things

1509
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,489
up from response we can start the timer

1510
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:31,620
again make sure the minutes note that

1511
01:18:29,489 --> 01:18:33,080
I'm going to take a vote who thinks it's

1512
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:35,130
ready because we thought we were before

1513
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,340
what we need if people who are ready to

1514
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:52,469
read so please participate alright next

1515
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:54,660
after tortoise is dig this is the three

1516
01:18:52,469 --> 01:18:58,000
letter M acronym and not the four letter

1517
01:18:54,660 --> 01:19:03,769
correct and movie without the piece

1518
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:07,170
[Laughter]

1519
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:10,050
alright just go to the next slide I

1520
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:11,880
guess there's only one slide really so I

1521
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:14,340
thought we were done with this document

1522
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:17,390
but then I realized that one month you

1523
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:20,430
want to discuss with the working group

1524
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:24,300
currently we are saying that the source

1525
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:26,820
address so the MLD or or RMP messages is

1526
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:29,420
the beer prefix and we use that to

1527
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:33,090
figure out the B Friday or the sender

1528
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:35,489
and subdomain we completely figure out

1529
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:37,710
we just said it has to be configured in

1530
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:40,019
some way or you can use multiple

1531
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:41,989
instances as it's discussed in the draft

1532
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:45,739
and you could say for a certain

1533
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:50,610
destination address we assume a certain

1534
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:52,468
subdomain anyway in pema decided that we

1535
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:54,929
wanted to use that John attribute to

1536
01:19:52,469 --> 01:19:57,660
explicitly specify the be Friday and

1537
01:19:54,930 --> 01:20:00,330
subdomain and so on out there oh the

1538
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:02,580
join sender instead of relying on this

1539
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:05,429
and the question is should we do

1540
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:07,910
something like that for our EMP MLB

1541
01:20:05,429 --> 01:20:11,690
overlay

1542
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:13,130
that the issue is that tip typical

1543
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:16,070
implementation at least some

1544
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:18,050
implementations when you parse the RMP

1545
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:21,320
remedy packet you don't have access to

1546
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:26,120
the deBeer header that could tell you

1547
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:31,730
who sent the which beavers sent the join

1548
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:33,769
message or origin PM le report so one

1549
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:37,250
option is to say they'll just go with

1550
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:38,690
what we have it works it just makes some

1551
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:41,360
assumptions on the source address and

1552
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:44,389
configuration and stuff or we could

1553
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:47,990
potentially delay this draft further and

1554
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:51,380
do some work on extending the item PM LD

1555
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:53,840
messages to include this information I

1556
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:57,020
would say normally it's a non-starter to

1557
01:20:53,840 --> 01:21:00,170
modify our EMP or Emily but these

1558
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:01,940
messages only sent or received by beer

1559
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:05,170
routers so it's not like any

1560
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:10,040
modifications any many existing

1561
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:13,370
implementations also maybe a bit for a

1562
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:16,130
background in the RMP worsen 3ml ever

1563
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:19,010
since your RF sees it this explained how

1564
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:22,190
you can have additional data in the

1565
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:24,650
message and how existing implementation

1566
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:28,849
should just ignore any such additional

1567
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:30,559
data but we could possibly update those

1568
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:33,710
and do something special for beer if

1569
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:36,260
that's what they wanna do who may not

1570
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:38,450
hear just thinking out loud

1571
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:41,960
it isn't this the same comments that

1572
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:43,580
were made for yes it's the same so

1573
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:47,150
within the same hardware without the

1574
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:49,220
same issue yeah so that means either as

1575
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:51,639
if you have that issue it means that

1576
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:54,710
either we need to add this information

1577
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:57,680
or we need to just enforce and say use

1578
01:21:54,710 --> 01:22:02,300
the vo prefixes the source and decode

1579
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:04,010
that from the this source address yeah

1580
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:07,100
yeah I agree and I think that's on the

1581
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:09,950
suit all I'm trying to say is that so

1582
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:12,710
so for pin we made an assumption as a

1583
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:14,300
working group that you know using the

1584
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:17,450
beer information from the beer header

1585
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:19,269
could be hard for certain hard yeah yes

1586
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:22,599
I think that I would imagine

1587
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:24,820
yeah yeah that's so assuming that that

1588
01:22:22,599 --> 01:22:27,309
is not possible where it is very hard

1589
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:30,159
then you only have two options either we

1590
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:33,610
just say used to be a prefix get the B

1591
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:36,190
Freddy from that just sort of getting

1592
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:39,579
subdomain by configuration or the other

1593
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:44,499
option is extending our EMP MLB messages

1594
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:46,360
themselves and yeah I'm just yeah

1595
01:22:44,499 --> 01:22:49,030
curious so people think about this I'm

1596
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,860
kind of agnostic myself it could be nice

1597
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:53,559
to include that extra info on the other

1598
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:57,219
hand it works the way it is defined now

1599
01:22:53,559 --> 01:22:59,170
and it's nice to be done with us but I

1600
01:22:57,219 --> 01:23:03,429
think it's good to discuss it or think

1601
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:05,320
about it before we publish the draft so

1602
01:23:03,429 --> 01:23:08,409
Jeff is coming to Mike alright good so

1603
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:11,619
women again in in my opinion it's fine

1604
01:23:08,409 --> 01:23:14,379
the way it is any hardware that supports

1605
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:18,389
beard it's some next generation hardware

1606
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:18,389
that can read into the header so okay

1607
01:23:19,469 --> 01:23:25,630
since we did that additional second in

1608
01:23:23,019 --> 01:23:32,380
proposed PIM and actually MEP as well

1609
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:33,789
with my dad said do this for AT&T and I

1610
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:37,239
guess one question if you want to do

1611
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:39,070
this for our GMP MLD is it worth

1612
01:23:37,239 --> 01:23:42,308
publishing what they have now and say

1613
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:44,650
this works and then you know do some

1614
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:47,610
kind of update to a new draft later with

1615
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:50,949
that extension or should be rather wait

1616
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:52,598
the problem with the problem in what I

1617
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:54,039
just said though is that implementations

1618
01:23:52,599 --> 01:23:56,860
may have to deal with two different ways

1619
01:23:54,039 --> 01:24:01,960
of doing things so maybe it's better to

1620
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:05,530
wait yeah I guess other than that so we

1621
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:09,820
don't have RC for a little longer there

1622
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:12,190
is no other bad impact right yeah at

1623
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:14,590
least I mean even if it's not an RFC

1624
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:17,259
people can charge implement what we have

1625
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:25,749
now even even if we delay the

1626
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:30,350
publication so so maybe we should check

1627
01:24:25,749 --> 01:24:32,000
on the list but if if people agree am

1628
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:34,400
I'm happy with what Geoffrey said if

1629
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,290
people agree with that then it means he

1630
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,719
won't be lost its call yet

1631
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:40,850
we need that it may actually need to go

1632
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:44,420
back to the pin working group and talk a

1633
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:49,280
bit about what is the best way of doing

1634
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:51,530
this kind of extension origin PM LD so I

1635
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,509
heard conflicting suggestion there was

1636
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:55,040
yeah progressed almost taken back to Pym

1637
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:56,680
so you saying this conversation should

1638
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,690
conclude with PIM before we go - no

1639
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:02,030
let's discuss this on my beard mailing

1640
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:06,370
this okay a little while I think if the

1641
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:06,370
decision is to extend out your family

1642
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:19,429
for as well no Tim all right thanks okay

1643
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:35,839
thanks it was a sandy show you got three

1644
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:38,090
in a row you ready good afternoon

1645
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,260
i'm sanna Dom from the key this

1646
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:49,280
furnishing is for purely ipv6 we have

1647
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:54,140
caused our pony eyes and many people so

1648
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:55,370
we know who the horrible bag let me read

1649
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:58,070
it

1650
01:25:55,370 --> 01:26:03,080
let's see the advantage of beer we know

1651
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:09,410
that here can achieve multicast I hope I

1652
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:12,110
hope forwarding and op c 8h tools 96

1653
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:15,380
defines to bear encapsulation ways I'm

1654
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:19,219
sure an anonymous and from it we know

1655
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:23,150
that a new internet type for peer is

1656
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:26,930
defined and if we want to use peer

1657
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:31,670
forwarding in ipv6 situation we can use

1658
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:36,130
the native Ethernet packet forwarded but

1659
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:39,050
we know in many networks the

1660
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:43,750
reorganization of the new Ethernet cable

1661
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:47,130
for peer cannot be supported so we

1662
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:50,530
he find a general and a simplest way to

1663
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:55,960
achieve the beer foreboding king ipv6

1664
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:59,080
situation and so we just introduced a

1665
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:03,940
new protocol and you can call it a new

1666
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:08,800
header in ipv6 frame and it can achieve

1667
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:10,870
the fast forwarding paths and so sort of

1668
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:16,060
their forwarding paths multicast

1669
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:20,620
forwarding and in order to receive the

1670
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:25,030
ipv6 encapsulation pure package rotor

1671
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:27,430
must advertise appear ipv6 encapsulation

1672
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:30,700
transportation stop Shelby it's a very

1673
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:35,200
simple sceptre we for the beer

1674
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:40,570
information therapy or defining OSPF

1675
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:45,760
releases or BP for a rotor in the word

1676
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:49,120
highs and advertises many encapsulation

1677
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:53,140
ways such as ipv6 and a healer nature or

1678
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:58,320
some other the rotor max must accept all

1679
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:58,320
the encapsulation it that it advertised

1680
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:07,000
because the extension fool ipv6 header

1681
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:11,019
is very simple so let's see the other

1682
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,100
fields in ipv6 header for directory

1683
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:14,940
connected neighbor

1684
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:17,760
we know that the destination address

1685
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:21,820
should be the neighbors link local

1686
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:25,060
address and the source address should be

1687
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:28,750
the rotors link local address but as we

1688
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:31,570
all know we can defend the local policy

1689
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:34,770
on the router but we can't keep the

1690
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:39,820
source address unchanged it on the other

1691
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:44,650
policy so we can make a great make many

1692
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:48,420
changes for it and an Arab of course

1693
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:53,259
the ipv6 here must be state water and

1694
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:56,470
let's see for now directly connected

1695
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:57,489
neighbor the destination address should

1696
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:59,829
be the beer

1697
01:28:57,489 --> 01:29:02,259
traffic's of the neighbor and the sauce

1698
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:05,499
at address should be these rotors we

1699
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:07,989
have our prefix and of course the TTL

1700
01:29:05,499 --> 01:29:11,079
must be large enough to get us a packet

1701
01:29:07,989 --> 01:29:13,570
to the neighbor and the flow I dealing

1702
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:16,449
the ipv6 packet issue to be copied from

1703
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:23,380
the entropy field in the Barry

1704
01:29:16,449 --> 01:29:25,780
encapsulation next week and the peer

1705
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:29,920
header is very simple because it's

1706
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:33,309
allowing away the format defining a P FC

1707
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:37,090
and eighty to ninety six for an Alan

1708

1711

1715
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:09,480
very much for his helpful for editor

1716
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:11,530
thank you so any comments mr. blue shoes

1717
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:13,570
sorry turret Secord haven't gotten

1718
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:16,210
around reading it but is this meant to

1719
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:18,999
support you know the way it sounded

1720
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:24,130
partial deployment of some hops use ipv6

1721
01:30:18,999 --> 01:30:28,480
and use Ethernet encapsulation right and

1722
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:31,360
you can use these ernet or so but you

1723
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:34,239
know that some chips will not support

1724
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:37,739
the record nursing of the either new

1725
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:41,468
user data type right so we can use these

1726
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:43,239
ipv6 extension to achieve peer

1727
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:46,090
forwarding so be our character will be

1728
01:30:43,239 --> 01:30:50,650
the payload of the ipv6 header and you

1729
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:53,590
can do hope I hope forwarding to achieve

1730
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:55,239
multicast well I'm saying I haven't read

1731
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:57,150
the draft so I haven't seen if there is

1732
01:30:55,239 --> 01:31:02,230
anything about partial deployment

1733
01:30:57,150 --> 01:31:04,119
capabilities given how you have but

1734
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:06,070
doesn't say anything about the slides

1735
01:31:04,119 --> 01:31:08,110
don't say anything about that it's just

1736
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:10,330
it kind of implied by the fact that you

1737
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:12,519
can have a remote neighbor

1738
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:15,070
and you're announced again the IGP is it

1739
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:18,400
meant to be Otto discovering yeah yes

1740
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:20,620
yes yes out calorie yeah so so the idea

1741
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,139
is not only the encapsulation but also

1742
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:24,490
the system might think that in the ITP

1743
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,750
you're kind of trying to figure out

1744
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:27,940
what's your next neighbor toward the

1745
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:31,230
destination that's you're capable okay

1746
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:35,410
yes because I didn't say this is just I

1747
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:39,730
think we I think I think we spelled it

1748
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:42,910
out in the draft the primary intended

1749
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:45,160
use is towards home net which means you

1750
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:47,349
have v6 chips which you cannot modify

1751
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:49,780
but you don't need a high throughput

1752
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:50,110
right you could be on the fast path for

1753
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:53,950
it

1754
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:57,219
go look behind a ipv6 header and process

1755
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:59,349
what is inside on l4 but if you don't

1756
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:01,300
have that then you have pure ipv6 you

1757
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:03,280
pop it up somewhere to a slow processor

1758
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:05,980
and you can process the stuff without

1759
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:07,809
changing any of the v6 chips or any MPLS

1760
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:09,610
or Ethernet support okay that was a

1761
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:13,120
great answer just not for the question I

1762
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:14,950
asked so the meant for partial

1763
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,950
deployments that you know but but

1764
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:20,050
basically it's meant for partial support

1765
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:22,870
networks the network can partially

1766
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:25,000
support beer and it will automatically

1767
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:29,309
build ear across the nodes that can

1768
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:32,620
support it yes no the funds also support

1769
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:34,360
well because if some nodes don't do beer

1770
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:36,849
it seems as if you can't got over them

1771
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:39,280
by having this non directly connected

1772
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:41,710
neighbor stuff that oh yes but that's

1773
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:44,679
just unintended consequence which is the

1774
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:47,950
strongest force in universe so it was

1775
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:50,170
intended to be purely hop by hop but of

1776
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:51,750
course you can go multiple hops all of a

1777
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:54,700
sudden you don't have to build tunnels

1778
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:56,320
right you can just use v6 to jump over

1779
01:32:54,700 --> 01:33:01,360
stuff yeah but that's unintended

1780
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:03,219
consequences it's an IP over IP so as a

1781
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:05,110
native kind of multicast person you

1782
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:07,780
don't like it but an operator could see

1783
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:11,500
it as a benefit that's precisely how I

1784
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:13,030
should show it okay I would say that

1785
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,040
that's fine that's fine so the only

1786
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:18,610
other small comment is I'm not sure

1787
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:21,190
about the cost of copying the entropy

1788
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:23,440
field into the flow ID and I'm not quite

1789
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:23,919
sure if both of them have exactly the

1790
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,190
same

1791
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:29,050
CMP meaning so maybe either sell it

1792
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:31,570
stronger or they degrade it to a may

1793
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:33,630
because you know forwarding plane there

1794
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:38,429
is a cost of copying these things

1795
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:41,380
yeah entropy is a tag how you process it

1796
01:33:38,429 --> 01:33:43,449
yourselves in a structure that just

1797
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,949
tells you it so you so when you get to

1798
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:46,059
those conditions you make those decision

1799
01:33:44,949 --> 01:33:48,580
right there but there's a lot of

1800
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:51,370
explanation beer and basically I don't I

1801
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:53,469
don't think you have at least to say

1802
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:55,630
that if you find an entropy on the beer

1803
01:33:53,469 --> 01:33:57,160
you better have the same entropy on v6

1804
01:33:55,630 --> 01:34:04,840
whatever it is because otherwise you

1805
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:07,210
start to miss order okay so so I think

1806
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:09,190
the draft says I mean just a little

1807
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:11,580
slide here that you are using link local

1808
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:14,769
address and TT other one so it seems

1809
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:18,820
clear that you can't bypass unknown be a

1810
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:21,730
rapper okay but if you I fear lower

1811
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:29,739
global address and all the TTL them you

1812
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:32,739
could of course okay all right so where

1813
01:34:29,739 --> 01:34:45,099
are we with this dark it's a dot that

1814
01:34:32,739 --> 01:34:50,709
isn't it for my date track this the

1815
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:55,660
third Rev it is Zhang beer so its

1816
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:58,230
current name is not an adopted draft all

1817
01:34:55,660 --> 01:35:00,670
right it's not wearing the document yet

1818
01:34:58,230 --> 01:35:05,739
it's not yet a working group document

1819
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:07,690
it's just it's not adopted as a draft

1820
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:09,730
for the working group yet right

1821
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:11,019
yeah that's i'm till checking status

1822
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:12,549
before i did that those are just

1823
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:13,150
confirming with you and my name's i got

1824
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,800
here so

1825
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:18,849
who's read the draft in this current

1826
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:21,010
form okay who thinks this should be

1827
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:25,660
adopted by the working group as when you

1828
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:27,160
buy them I've got yeah everyone who read

1829
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:29,260
and then some more all right let's take

1830
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:30,910
that to the list and we'll go from there

1831
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:33,090
okay you're not moving yes do right

1832
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:33,090
there

1833
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:50,700
thank you for protection

1834
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:53,680
yes source protection okay

1835
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:57,220
this presentation is for peer source

1836
01:35:53,680 --> 01:36:00,280
protection we have caused our Gregg and

1837
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:03,670
Jenn and that see the background of

1838
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:06,820
destruct and we know that the motive has

1839
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:11,680
the sauce always connects two or more

1840
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:14,500
always ingress routers to avoid a single

1841
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:20,200
node failure that's easy to understand

1842
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:23,800
right if this domain is beardo man you

1843
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:27,400
know that the ingress router we call it

1844
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:31,210
a BF iOS will advertise sourcing

1845
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:36,160
information to all the BFE eyes and the

1846
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:41,140
egress router will select the router

1847
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:45,940
which he thinks is the prevail priors

1848
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:49,300
and rotor is the upstream multicast hope

1849
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:54,250
and the signals to the selected via fire

1850
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:57,430
so in this picture picture we know that

1851
01:36:54,250 --> 01:37:00,700
and the PFA Yahoo will receive the

1852
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:04,600
advertisement from VFR 1 and V F IR to

1853
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:10,780
and from the local policy if ya - maybe

1854
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:14,020
it will choose B F IR one is um H so BFA

1855
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:18,490
Yahoo will signal to the BFI R 1 to get

1856
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:20,740
the multicast flow when the selected BFI

1857
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:26,170
affairs in this picture we suppose that

1858
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:29,440
the PFR one field the pfayetteville will

1859
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:32,650
choose the p fi r 2 s the um h and a

1860
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:36,129
second or two it from it we know that

1861
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:38,799
the sooner of the Vav architects the

1862
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:40,660
failure of the UMS the quicker the

1863
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:43,960
multicast flow recovers

1864
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:48,280
so in order to accelerate the detection

1865
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:53,110
time we have some solution about yet

1866
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:59,830
it's the first solution let's see the

1867
01:37:53,110 --> 01:38:03,160
ERP so the it's the same example if a

1868
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:06,220
yeah ii can send the periodical ping

1869
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:10,840
packet to the selected umh in this

1870
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:14,110
picture is be a fire one so P available

1871
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:17,410
and should reply to be fer to the ping

1872
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:21,730
packet so P fer to will monitor the

1873
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:25,030
status of PFR one and also the be a Fiat

1874
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:29,250
you can monitor the past status from VFR

1875
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:33,009
one to be a via to FB a Fiat who can't

1876
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:36,040
receives a reply from the behaved one

1877
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:39,880
for a period of time the PFA Yahoo will

1878
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:43,030
treat the PFR one is a failure load and

1879
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:49,120
it will second node to the PFI r2 to

1880
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:52,090
receive the multicast flow and in order

1881
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:56,500
to achieve the its goal the S&P ping or

1882
01:38:52,090 --> 01:39:02,440
the ping defining the airplane Draft can

1883
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:06,100
be used here but there's problem in this

1884
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:08,769
solution if the path from the BF ER to

1885
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:11,800
the selected the umh is different from

1886
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:15,760
the past from the umh to the behavior in

1887
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:19,480
this example we can attach if the past

1888
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:23,520
from PAPR to to be FR one is different

1889
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:28,709
from the past from b FR one to BF ER to

1890
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:33,190
the ping packet ER may result to an

1891
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:36,070
incorrect result because if the p the

1892
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:39,669
past from PFA year two to be fi are one

1893
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:43,240
hell is broken the path is the path of

1894
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:47,110
ROM BF our one to be fer two is good but

1895
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:51,490
as a ping packet er will not be received

1896
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:53,290
by be fr one comment on jabber doesn't

1897
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:56,620
the pink establish bi-directional or

1898
01:39:53,290 --> 01:40:00,090
each ability we can use transition

1899
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:00,090
though as SMTP

1900
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:03,740
sorry

1901
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:11,040
so do we use beer bingo we do

1902
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:11,700
traditional ICMP Kylie's doing her also

1903
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,280
abused

1904
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:16,740
yes you can use the traditional king

1905
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:21,179
because you're the penis of Romans the

1906
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:23,940
BFA yacht will be a fire so that the two

1907
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:29,550
functions can always be used here

1908
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:30,599
there's Esther depends your choice so

1909
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:36,180
mmm

1910
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:38,970
if the path is different maybe is a pink

1911
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:43,080
packet er will be lost in some ways and

1912
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:46,860
the so BFE r2 will make us a necessary

1913
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:48,540
switchover I might be wrong but this is

1914
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:51,389
steak I think what we're saying is if

1915
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:54,300
the if you have a symmetric routing so

1916
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:56,640
the path to there to that first hub or

1917
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:59,340
to the BFI are is different from the

1918
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:05,190
return path yes yes and the the request

1919
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:09,360
might be lost on the way to yes yes next

1920
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:13,200
piece let's see the second the solution

1921
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:17,190
the BR PFT it's defending the RPG

1922
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:20,280
dropped and so we know that the in this

1923
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:23,429
solution the universe router will sense

1924
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:26,730
the periodico us today the periodical p2

1925
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:27,630
and ppfd control package to all the bf

1926
01:41:26,730 --> 01:41:32,339
yes

1927
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:36,240
which is select itself as the um edge so

1928
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:40,710
the egress routers in this example we

1929
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:44,670
know that the we suppose that the BFE i1

1930
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:48,540
+ PF e r2 + b f r3 all choose the b FR 1

1931
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:51,570
is the um edge so PF our one will send

1932
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:57,690
the periodical feed from ppfd package to

1933
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:59,880
all these three routers so if somebody

1934
01:41:57,690 --> 01:42:03,660
ahhhhh in this picture we suppose that

1935
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:07,460
bf yah one cannot who receives a packet

1936
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:12,450
from if I are one and the reason maybe

1937
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:14,400
maybe the BFF IR one has failed and the

1938
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:17,460
other reason maybe the past from

1939
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:21,989
I want to be a Fiat who is broken so BAV

1940
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:27,719
yeah what can choose the be fio2 is umh

1941
01:42:21,989 --> 01:42:31,379
and the second or two here and so again

1942
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:34,320
this function we we can use the pure

1943
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:37,350
ping packet a defender in burping draft

1944
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:40,830
to bootstraps the people and PPF

1945
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:44,580
decision so this is a easy way and the

1946
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:47,969
earth and the past from the egress

1947
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:52,080
ingress router to the egress router is

1948
01:42:47,969 --> 01:42:56,100
the same with multicast flow so there is

1949
01:42:52,080 --> 01:43:00,870
no problem that will cost by the PRP

1950
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:04,170
just we mentioned in master slides this

1951
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:05,909
is a great question is there a reason

1952
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:09,210
why you're not running BFD between both

1953
01:43:05,909 --> 01:43:11,849
Canada B I thought from both Canada B if

1954
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:13,199
IR s down to the B F ers it sounds like

1955
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:15,420
you just have the BFD running on one

1956
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:17,309
case and when the detection is failures

1957
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:20,100
detected you have to then not only

1958
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:22,440
reelect but then re-establish a VFD

1959
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:24,000
relationship and begin that process it

1960
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:25,650
seems it would be more expedient to have

1961
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,730
that running between both and then

1962
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:29,699
you'll know if you got a double failure

1963
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:31,199
you'll know if one comes back live right

1964
01:43:29,699 --> 01:43:35,280
there's an active relationship between

1965
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:38,519
both candidates hmm I think a you means

1966
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:40,920
that if was also a bf I ask you the same

1967
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:45,750
as a beer yeah if the brackets is right

1968
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:47,460
in this is a question because for

1969
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:50,159
different emotive half the flow

1970
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:50,760
different if I our B choose to for it

1971
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:54,710
right

1972
01:43:50,760 --> 01:44:00,409
true yes so the nation all no yes yes so

1973
01:43:54,710 --> 01:44:07,110
we think that if the mmm ever the truth

1974
01:44:00,409 --> 01:44:09,449
bf4 is sending the packet to the it's

1975
01:44:07,110 --> 01:44:11,519
necessary for the truth the PFI are to

1976
01:44:09,449 --> 01:44:15,989
stand in the packet a to zaroor the PVR

1977
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:18,960
right and the maybe is a if I are to the

1978
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:21,419
back will become hoeata back half right

1979
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,800
back up can send a the generator

1980
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:26,910
editor

1981
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:29,460
arsal it has what no you has then I just

1982
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:31,519
mean that because in this feature we

1983
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:36,600
know that's the beer for our one is

1984
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:39,870
primary standing petted but maybe BFI

1985
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:41,820
are to respond stirred for some other

1986
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:45,019
people for the Eau de Caza forwarding

1987
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:49,830
right so we have our 1 concern does a

1988
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:53,160
karateka be FDA packet to the be fer one

1989
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:56,850
to be a yes yes read and the BFI are two

1990
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:59,790
can send also the the chillin EF de

1991
01:44:56,850 --> 01:45:03,930
pocketed to the other the FA yes which

1992
01:44:59,790 --> 01:45:06,870
selected his you jump to an application

1993
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:10,290
of it or but I'm thinking more just from

1994
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:14,010
a protocol design operational decision

1995
01:45:10,290 --> 01:45:15,000
the EFI the B F ers decide which be if I

1996
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:17,580
are mm-hmm

1997
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,750
okay so if they're deciding they need to

1998
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:19,980
know whose all there they didn't know

1999
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:22,080
the liveness of all of them that are

2000
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,459
there right so it's almost like you're

2001
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,230
making you're letting them decide and

2002
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:27,870
then you're making them tell me if I are

2003
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:30,540
what they're going to do to detect the

2004
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:32,400
liveness it be it seems to me I'm just

2005
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:33,780
saying if I knew that all over there and

2006
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,670
I'm independently making decisions on

2007
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:36,690
which one I'm going to use I'd like to

2008
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:38,790
have all the information all the time

2009
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:39,929
and then I could decide you know what's

2010
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:42,120
my primary backup would have that

2011
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:44,250
algorithm is backwards yes isn't it

2012
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:46,890
yes right and then then you can know if

2013
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:48,360
I have a double failure if a BFD died on

2014
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:50,190
one I try to re-establish another one i

2015
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,480
I am assuming it's there it may be gone

2016
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:54,059
as well they make the filler maybe

2017
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:56,969
somewhere else right or between the two

2018
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:59,670
so I just it's it's noise in terms of

2019
01:45:56,970 --> 01:46:02,700
messaging and the state machine already

2020
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:05,340
has to be ready it seems to be a more

2021
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:09,059
efficient process if we just let them

2022
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:12,360
communicate all the time so there's many

2023
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:16,770
ways to nose off they are also ingress

2024
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:19,019
is all that detecting my neighbors to

2025
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:20,970
begin a process is not really expedient

2026
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:22,770
once I have my neighbors and I want to

2027
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:25,110
elect between them that's much quicker I

2028
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:29,040
need be on top of that stuff so is there

2029
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:31,559
a is there an example within application

2030
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:33,780
the uses of BFD where I'm not just doing

2031
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:36,150
point-to-point liveness but I'm doing a

2032
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:38,699
redundancy comparison like this

2033
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:41,519
that's if we take an existing mechanism

2034
01:46:38,699 --> 01:46:44,159
using VFD that's not beer related that

2035
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,449
looks like this we'll just you know we

2036
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:50,509
then we have some precedence Geoffrey's

2037
01:46:45,449 --> 01:46:54,540
got an answer okay so imagine the

2038
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:56,820
overlay here you use its PGP MVP M then

2039
01:46:54,540 --> 01:47:00,420
what you have presented so far it's

2040
01:46:56,820 --> 01:47:03,690
already covered by by the the phosphate

2041
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:04,620
over her yes I'm looking for us to feel

2042
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:08,159
overpressure

2043
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:12,469
yeah and another question here is that

2044
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:14,969
with fear supposedly the unica safe are

2045
01:47:12,469 --> 01:47:18,570
utilizing will be used and then you can

2046
01:47:14,969 --> 01:47:24,830
quickly switch over to the backup pass

2047
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:29,040
so most likely your traffic will recover

2048
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:32,610
very quickly and now when you use this

2049
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:38,340
PFD or PM to decide to switch to the

2050
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:40,679
backup be a PI R I wonder you if that

2051
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:45,179
switch over would take a longer time for

2052
01:47:40,679 --> 01:47:49,170
your beer traffic to recover with the

2053
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:53,219
original efi are the egress rotor can

2054
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:57,270
send a signal into the backup ingress

2055
01:47:53,219 --> 01:48:01,770
router for backup the purpose right but

2056
01:47:57,270 --> 01:48:03,659
it's not including this draft i think

2057
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:06,390
it's many ways to achieve it right

2058
01:48:03,659 --> 01:48:08,670
because ii Oleum will take time

2059
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:12,390
yeah right so the first of all teat a

2060
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:15,150
PFD for the DFT to detect that you have

2061
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:18,300
a problem that takes time and then you

2062
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:22,259
send a signal into the back happy if IR

2063
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:25,110
that takes some more time so I wonder by

2064
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:28,260
the by the time all this detection and

2065
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:31,080
switchover her request happens the the

2066
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:33,239
the original that the traffic from the

2067
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:36,510
original P Farr may already have

2068
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:39,839
recovered on the back half pass I'm just

2069
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:43,949
curious if that could be the case you

2070
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:45,690
just a sink in a solution figure yes I

2071
01:48:43,949 --> 01:48:48,239
agree with that comments if there's a

2072
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:49,940
link failure you might be able to route

2073
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:53,150
around it and you may not eat it

2074
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:56,000
which ingress router is forwarding what

2075
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:58,250
you may be he do is do some kind of

2076
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:01,310
forwarder election though and do BFD

2077
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:02,930
between be if I are one and two and if

2078
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:05,630
one of them goes down and the other one

2079
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:09,680
takes our SS forwarder if you imagine

2080
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:12,710
that you actually join to both both the

2081
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:16,760
bf IRS but only one of them will send

2082
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:21,110
your data yes in P me you can join the

2083
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:23,660
two PF p fi RS and receives of all the

2084
01:49:21,110 --> 01:49:27,139
multicast flow butter you're just folder

2085
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:29,690
one flow from the PF i r1 and the

2086
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:31,430
discard there's a other flow yeah just

2087
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:33,320
quickly also if you're using m LD

2088
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:35,840
overlay you are sending your Emily

2089
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:37,489
reports to all all that Bevers yes so

2090
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:41,750
either of them can decide on their own

2091
01:49:37,489 --> 01:49:47,809
which ones it forward one more question

2092
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:53,540
we got move Neil's just as a extension

2093
01:49:47,810 --> 01:49:55,190
to what Jeffrey and stick just said what

2094
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:58,190
are you trying to cover when you're

2095
01:49:55,190 --> 01:50:00,349
trying to cover a node failure I'm not

2096
01:49:58,190 --> 01:50:01,790
sure if this is the right mechanism if

2097
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:04,370
you're trying to cover the link area

2098
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:08,360
then the underlay is probably quicker to

2099
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:12,140
detect it then then you can do with a in

2100
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:15,230
the overlay because the PF key can't get

2101
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:18,560
hacked has no the feeder can also get

2102
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:21,320
hacked as a link fader right because the

2103
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:25,340
pass from the ugurus rotor to the egress

2104
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:28,429
router at will if the rotor is broken

2105
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:32,180
the PFD factor will be discarded so you

2106
01:50:28,430 --> 01:50:35,090
can use a PFD way to find the post no

2107
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:37,820
the feather and then understate my

2108
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:39,920
comment is more on the line I think this

2109
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:42,559
is already detected in the underlay

2110
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,300
before you get the response from BFT can

2111
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,400
i address that that one's been beaten up

2112
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,949
but you had such a question initially

2113
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:50,030
about node failure all your comment was

2114
01:50:48,949 --> 01:50:52,280
I don't think this is the right

2115
01:50:50,030 --> 01:50:55,540
mechanism what would be the right

2116
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:55,540
mechanism for node failure then

2117
01:50:55,730 --> 01:50:58,889
[Music]

2118
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:06,799
more on the line what what stick has

2119
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:10,610
mentioned before so that you you join

2120
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:12,890
two to two ingress routers and balance

2121
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:14,269
it why are the joints there but then

2122
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:18,890
they have to communicate between you

2123
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:22,790
know who's actually good is why then the

2124
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:26,450
BF ER has to know which which nodes

2125
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:31,519
exist and the underlay does does detect

2126
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:33,470
if if there's a being fairly underway

2127
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:36,230
we're talking node failures on ingress

2128
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:38,150
that's the underlay is just going to

2129
01:51:36,230 --> 01:51:39,799
give you topology information right

2130
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:42,589
needle route packets accordingly I'm

2131
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:44,660
trying to I join them both they need to

2132
01:51:42,590 --> 01:51:47,120
know which one is going to send packets

2133
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:50,660
on behalf of those joints yes alright so

2134
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:52,610
yeah communication but if I can't reach

2135
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:54,680
the note anymore and this is probably

2136
01:51:52,610 --> 01:51:56,120
quicker detected in the in the unit who

2137
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:59,960
are you you said I can't reach the note

2138
01:51:56,120 --> 01:52:02,840
if the via via doesn't get any and you

2139
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:05,990
couldn't any route anymore to the PF ir

2140
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:07,820
routes by me the failure could be not

2141
01:52:05,990 --> 01:52:09,559
just it could I have a route to it just

2142
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:10,940
fine it's not moving packets networks

2143
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:14,440
link behind it's failed and that's not

2144
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:14,440
going to be a my GP I'll never know

2145
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:22,130
exact as a BF ir yes that's different

2146
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:23,750
than its down right so that's route to

2147
01:52:22,130 --> 01:52:25,190
it it's not gonna be detection okay

2148
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:27,800
that's a different use case that I

2149
01:52:25,190 --> 01:52:30,230
thought about was still redundant

2150
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:32,240
redundant ingress routers they can fail

2151
01:52:30,230 --> 01:52:34,790
in numerous ways it'd be nice to have a

2152
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:37,280
mechanism that address them all and

2153
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:39,140
instead of a bunch of pieces taking up

2154
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:41,120
to fine as I said this was a different

2155
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:44,510
use case than I thought about okay okay

2156
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:46,970
I think this picture may cause some

2157
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:50,150
confusion about it it's not one hope

2158
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:54,560
from the ether s rotor to the egress

2159
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:56,480
route her story is multi hopeful from

2160
01:52:54,560 --> 01:53:06,920
the ingress water to egress water

2161
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:09,660
service read every IETF draft right just

2162
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:12,390
a cloud picture right there yes

2163
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:14,070
this is great discussion I think we need

2164
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:15,300
to really consider all of the failure

2165
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:17,309
scenarios to be kind of interesting to

2166
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:19,590
to break those down and see what we have

2167
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:21,030
in terms of solutions what problems

2168
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:24,510
they're addressing and maybe if there's

2169
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:28,559
some open problems but who's read the

2170
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:31,260
draft currently all right and I don't

2171
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:35,100
believe it's adopted right it is still

2172
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:36,450
an independent craft okay and you think

2173
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:39,420
this is kind of work we'd like to adopt

2174
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:43,950
in the working group I see any hands I

2175
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:46,950
see a few hands okay all right because

2176
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:48,360
honestly I think it's I think it's worth

2177
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:49,740
taking on this just drag independent

2178
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:51,900
just didn't keep these conversations

2179
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:53,670
going so that we come to a conclusion

2180
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:56,400
whether it goes all the way to RFC or

2181
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:58,350
not it's irrelevant in our process we

2182
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:59,969
have to solve problems and whatever the

2183
01:53:58,350 --> 01:54:02,850
solutions fall out this is helping us to

2184
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:05,790
get there I think we should do it thank

2185
01:54:02,850 --> 01:54:11,270
you oh yes young lady

2186
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:11,269
I only had this um I hadn't read this I

2187
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:18,660
haven't read this particular draft but

2188
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:23,220
on the case of sort of trying to detect

2189
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:26,130
node failures and so on the ml DP fast

2190
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:27,690
reroute RFC talks about figuring out

2191
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:29,610
whether it's a link or a node failure

2192
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:31,559
based on where traffic streams are

2193
01:54:29,610 --> 01:54:35,190
coming in and if you haven't looked at

2194
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:38,330
that you might find it interesting yes

2195
01:54:35,190 --> 01:54:41,400
great input thank you thank you all

2196
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,600
right you haven't one more I think don't

2197
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:45,589
you yes

2198
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:45,590
last four

2199
01:54:52,530 --> 01:55:04,719
yeah PFT yeah yeah you just I was

2200
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:08,110
showing how you alright Co me this front

2201
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:10,860
is for PR PFT because the author account

2202
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:16,449
attended this meeting because of the

2203
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:21,070
visa problem so I present it is strapped

2204
01:55:16,449 --> 01:55:25,360
for her and the update of this version

2205
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:28,989
is the description about PRP of decision

2206
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:33,309
bootstrapping and the actual hotel part

2207
01:55:28,989 --> 01:55:35,980
has been updated and we know that the

2208
01:55:33,310 --> 01:55:41,230
multi-point of EFT and active terror

2209
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:46,989
draft has being published as FC propose

2210
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:50,949
the standard of ca10 562 and 8563

2211
01:55:46,989 --> 01:55:56,830
and also the other modification is about

2212
01:55:50,949 --> 01:55:58,799
the PRP ft sub Jovi or sub sub shall be

2213
01:55:56,830 --> 01:56:02,800
carried genes

2214
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:05,320
SPF and you see is advertisement it's

2215
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:15,030
aligned with appearing for mission

2216
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:19,630
advertisement the PRP of T is based of

2217
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:23,019
cat5 62 and so it used the D minor mode

2218
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:25,810
to build as a BF decision okay I just

2219
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:28,000
jump in on the time that this is this is

2220
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:29,560
great but this is not sure how it works

2221
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,179
is just you've done your homework this

2222
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:34,690
is great so let's go what our next steps

2223
01:56:31,179 --> 01:56:36,040
are here so the idea I think with BFD

2224
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:38,379
and how its units all standards based

2225
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:40,870
which is excellent I had the one comment

2226
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:42,850
about that use case if there's an

2227
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:44,380
existing use case where BFD is used like

2228
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:47,320
that we can kind of use as a model be

2229
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:49,719
beneficial are there other use cases in

2230
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:52,989
this draft besides the one you just

2231
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:57,340
presented before you or in mindedly the

2232
01:56:52,989 --> 01:57:00,250
previous presentation is for this yes

2233
01:56:57,340 --> 01:57:03,130
it's a usage of the BRB FT right the

2234
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:06,220
only one not so many but I think it can

2235
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:10,840
be used the other question yeah

2236
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:13,380
whose run this trap no readings when I

2237
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:15,880
trying to lose a long time ago yeah

2238
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:17,410
alright so I think it's willing to throw

2239
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:19,750
to the list get some feedback on it

2240
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:21,309
again I think to work from this right

2241
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:23,200
now is tied to the previous draft which

2242
01:57:21,310 --> 01:57:24,640
we're gonna take to the list anyway so I

2243
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:26,139
think it makes sense to have this part

2244
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:28,060
of the conversation well we'll take it

2245
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:30,400
to listen see where we go okay thank you

2246
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:32,050
thank you sorry for pushing a bit but

2247
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:34,960
we've got we're almost at a time when

2248
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:40,060
we've got at least one more here we got

2249
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:42,330
Mike McBride Hey Hey look at his face is

2250
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:46,810
up there hmm

2251
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:47,920
best-looking guy in the room have you

2252
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:51,790
been watching us all this time

2253
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:55,470
yep and telling Hoxie all right go for

2254
01:57:51,790 --> 01:57:58,180
it okay so at this point three-minute

2255
01:57:55,470 --> 01:58:01,780
review there may not be much any time

2256
01:57:58,180 --> 01:58:03,730
for discussion but this draft has moved

2257
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:05,740
from a problem statement to a

2258
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:09,519
requirements draft for last night if

2259
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:10,929
discussion we've per the decision of the

2260
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,780
working group moved the requirements

2261
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:14,730
section up making that the main focus of

2262
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:18,160
the draft

2263
01:58:14,730 --> 01:58:22,719
we added regime as a co-author it's now

2264
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:24,400
a working group document and we've put

2265
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:26,730
out a new array of mainly developing the

2266
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:28,299
requirements section next slide

2267
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:33,400
hopefully you already know what the

2268
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:35,680
draft purposes so next slide so the

2269
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:37,900
these are the requirements and we've

2270
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:40,750
added some more commentary to some of

2271
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:43,030
these requirements we have a few

2272
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:46,440
additional requirements that we intend

2273
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:50,950
to put into the document between now and

2274
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:53,650
next month and please look at these

2275
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:56,550
requirements if you go to the exercise

2276
01:58:53,650 --> 01:59:01,839
you'll see some new requirements that we

2277
01:58:56,550 --> 01:59:05,140
intend to put into the document my

2278
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:08,680
suggestion request based on our last

2279
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:11,610
discussion it's that we probably

2280
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:15,590
shouldn't drink options

2281
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:21,380
Solutions until this apartments draft is

2282
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:22,520
more mature and I think we can get to

2283
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:28,230
[Music]

2284
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:35,270
requirements draft that we were there to

2285
01:59:28,230 --> 01:59:43,428
get to that point each other documents

2286
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:50,909
contribute to giving our best what those

2287
01:59:43,429 --> 01:59:54,179
are and where this thing that leads us

2288
01:59:50,909 --> 01:59:56,460
to that last slide is just looking at

2289
01:59:54,179 --> 01:59:58,199
you know the different solutions we need

2290
01:59:56,460 --> 02:00:02,190
to provide the pros and cons per our

2291
01:59:58,199 --> 02:00:04,980
discussion less EF l so we will we need

2292
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:07,678
to be as impartial as possible we

2293
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:09,209
probably need to which we don't do right

2294
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:11,550
now explicitly state at the beginning

2295
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:13,949
whether this is an encapsulation method

2296
02:00:11,550 --> 02:00:16,170
if visits an encoding method we probably

2297
02:00:13,949 --> 02:00:19,110
need to agree on what exactly native

2298
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:21,239
ipv6 means to us and because everybody

2299
02:00:19,110 --> 02:00:23,699
and in all those solutions we all talk

2300
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:24,989
about native ipv6 I think it made me a

2301
02:00:23,699 --> 02:00:27,210
little bit something different each of

2302
02:00:24,989 --> 02:00:28,739
us we don't have time to discuss it now

2303
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:30,810
but we can take these things to the list

2304
02:00:28,739 --> 02:00:34,409
but that's our request and that's the

2305
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:36,030
update so my thanks for much for doing

2306
02:00:34,409 --> 02:00:38,549
this remote I'm sorry they got crushed

2307
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:40,259
on time I read through most of this

2308
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:41,940
again this morning and you you hit on

2309
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:43,619
the point that I wanted to make and I

2310
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:47,489
just want to beat this dead horse a

2311
02:00:43,619 --> 02:00:50,849
couple more times here if there's any

2312
02:00:47,489 --> 02:00:52,440
reason to modify the bier header there

2313
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:54,090
needs to be some justification in doing

2314
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:56,730
so we have a beer encoding already

2315
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:57,570
established encapsulation is what we're

2316
02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:59,099
really targeting if there's

2317
02:00:57,570 --> 02:01:00,420
encapsulation use cases to do it but

2318
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:02,699
when we merge the two as you said

2319
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:04,500
capsulation encoding there has to be

2320
02:01:02,699 --> 02:01:06,150
reason why we're doing that you know and

2321
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:07,350
caps to get over something but the

2322
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:09,929
encodes already established in this cut

2323
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:12,600
in stone we can we can deconstruct it

2324
02:01:09,929 --> 02:01:14,010
but there's we need to know why right

2325
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:15,810
because there's hardware being built to

2326
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:17,250
pipeline this stuff through and if

2327
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:19,530
there's another step to be ordered in

2328
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:20,940
front of it to take pieces out of an

2329
02:01:19,530 --> 02:01:23,580
existing header and put it back into a

2330
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:25,438
beer structure for the hardware it's and

2331
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:27,179
consider transitional that's

2332
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:28,999
transitional hardware is a really hard

2333
02:01:27,179 --> 02:01:32,639
sell yeah right

2334
02:01:28,999 --> 02:01:36,570
yeah agree that will all be specified in

2335
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:38,849
this draft okay but and again I don't

2336
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:40,949
want to read it one more point if your

2337
02:01:38,849 --> 02:01:42,300
solutions in this document please step

2338
02:01:40,949 --> 02:01:44,159
up I mean that that's the deification

2339
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:46,199
comes through you can come out and say

2340
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:47,969
this is what we need the existing tools

2341
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:49,768
don't get us there we need something

2342
02:01:47,969 --> 02:01:51,869
else then we've got a reason to go

2343
02:01:49,769 --> 02:01:54,209
forward with this work so if your use

2344
02:01:51,869 --> 02:01:55,499
case is on there and and you think this

2345
02:01:54,209 --> 02:01:59,459
is important work you need to make your

2346
02:01:55,499 --> 02:02:01,789
case thank you thank you Mike any other

2347
02:01:59,459 --> 02:02:01,789
questions

2348
02:02:03,889 --> 02:02:09,840
Belushi's came back Mike thanks for the

2349
02:02:08,099 --> 02:02:20,010
presentation was excellent and thanks

2350
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:22,489
for keeping you so terse and thermos is

2351
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:22,489
on the way
