email please do this please contribute

46
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:05,870
this is the way we make progress so now

47
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,430
to what we've done recently what's

48
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:12,250
always good to report we've done real

49
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:18,169
work the LEP HB draft has now become RFC

50
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:20,000
Saar FC 862 to the new code point and is

51
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:24,349
defined in that and is now in the eye on

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,430
a registry this is a nice result because

53
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,919
this particular document is actually

54
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,349
being talked about by other people other

55
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,740
people are referring to it already so

56
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:40,520
that's good we have 4 internet drafts in

57
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:43,130
RFC early to q2 on the effect subject

58
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,460
the fact framework extension and the

59
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,960
FEC's sliding-window RLC which we've

60
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,989
been through this working group for some

61
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,909
time I did a third one which talks about

62
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,280
the pseudo-random number generator where

63
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,710
upon which their base so these three

64
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,109
form a group together in the rst air to

65
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,599
cure a new contribution the old

66
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,800
contribution is the diffserv and WebRTC

67
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:05,539
QRS

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,780
which is still residing on a mystery I

69
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:10,580
think cluster two three eight and we are

70
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,440
now being promised her to threaten that

71
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,690
the cluster two three eight floodgates

72
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,240
will open next month which should result

73
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:23,750
in this in this draft I'm being

74
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,840
publishers in RFC and that's going to be

75
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,169
exciting

76
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,869
[Music]

77
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,580
there's no ideas at the iesg which means

78
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,259
our area director has not got enough

79
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,659
work so we'll try and keep him busy

80
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,930
during this idea by sending things to

81
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:42,979
him if you wish there's two IDs with

82
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,500
working group chairs and authors after

83
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:48,590
working great let's call okay so it took

84
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,449
two tries to get these drafts through

85
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,489
working the blast call may it call

86
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,289
prefer for for not doing good job in the

87
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,169
first one the drafts are now through

88
00:06:54,289 --> 00:07:02,628
last call they're mostly revised except

89
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:05,419
the second draft which is the RFC 6040

90
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:08,300
update shim there was some brand new

91
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,729
text written on fragmentation after

92
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,770
working group last call completed that

93
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:15,830
text needs review there was just a

94
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,780
comment this morning that the text

95
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,789
problem at text may be problematic I've

96
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,279
sent out a comment suggesting that is a

97
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,169
concern we need to figure out what to do

98
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,419
about that text when its final form is

99
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,810
once that's done I can do the Shepherd

100
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,930
right up and and gif Magnus with these

101
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,789
two graphs

102
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:38,000
does anybody have any further comments

103
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:41,719
or concerns regarding these two drafts

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,819
on the working group compostela one of

105
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:45,289
the office I just wanted to say that it

106
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,810
was written after last call because the

107
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:51,229
comment in law school oh right it's just

108
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,969
that it has done usual amount of content

109
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:56,840
to it for post working group class call

110
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:58,340
text and therefore we we need we need to

111
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,568
take a little extra view time to try

112
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,880
better right there actually is the same

113
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,770
problem to same conflicting bullet

114
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:14,960
routes they have the base with the same

115
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:16,900
mechanism okay so please discuss on the

116
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:25,659
list and we will see

117
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:27,820
how to proceed from this we have no

118
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,410
ideas in working group last fall apart

119
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,449
from the discussion of those two that we

120
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,890
just mentioned but we have two ideas

121
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:38,070
like to go to working group us call soon

122
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,689
okay the transport header

123
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,870
confidentiality impacts draft will be

124
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,180
presented at this meeting and we

125
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,650
mentioned previous meeting that this

126
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,560
would be the time to working group must

127
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:55,810
call it so that will be discussed at the

128
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,969
current meeting the DPL PM tud draft has

129
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,790
been ongoing for some time it is nearing

130
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,160
working group us call it is not ready

131
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:11,680
yet but it might be ready before the

132
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:13,150
next meeting okay l4 s drafts we're

133
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,020
going to figure out what to do about

134
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:19,029
those as the first order of business

135
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,459
first sort of business during during the

136
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:29,279
mean tomorrow so there's no comment here

137
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:33,089
on upon process steps word okay okay

138
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:36,339
beyond that six additional working group

139
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:39,820
drafts going to talk about today

140
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,430
the SCTP of this draft

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,550
there are the three out fresh grass a

142
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,469
UDP options and tunnel tunnel tunnel

143
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,900
Jessen feedback I think combination of

144
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,040
feedback is not on the agenda this time

145
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,670
it's not on the agenda for discussion

146
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,000
this time around the the quorum

147
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,640
mechanism in that draft is is stable of

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,120
and it will progress as other drafts

149
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:13,689
that are taking advantage of it progress

150
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:17,260
on the SCT peanuts is also to Cheston

151
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,630
quakes like a young yeah we somehow drop

152
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,100
drop their CTV not NAT into a crack at

153
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,920
you the children on that slide we'll fix

154
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,709
that okay so there are a number of

155
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,719
transport related traps and I think it

156
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,000
is very useful to call these out please

157
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,070
transport issues in other working groups

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,890
and please bring them back here if you

159
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:40,450
need to be discussed one of these is the

160
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:44,060
path MTU discovery hop-by-hop option

161
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:48,080
which was proposed as a working group

162
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,300
item in six months idea obviously this

163
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,740
is a mechanism to it with path MTU

164
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,990
discovery so it is relevant to transport

165
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,140
discuss that in six month lease there's

166
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,720
an ipv6 reservation protocol you don't

167
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:08,140
say anything about this this was

168
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,430
presented several i'ts roie tf's ago the

169
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,400
authors are continuing to work on this

170
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,310
it will will reappear at some point it's

171
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,500
not on this this I guess agendas it's

172
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,020
not it's it's not none somebody for an

173
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,410
update moving on to the next one we have

174
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,540
an elf forest and diffserv draft this

175
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,480
might be part of the discussion tomorrow

176
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,510
morning depending on which of five dozen

177
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,590
directions that discussion actually

178
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:39,319
actually goes in and there was a non

179
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:41,600
working group forming both on loops

180
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,150
which hopefully sea has transported

181
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,000
pipes as well as network into internet

182
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,069
probably implications there so look at

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,370
the loose slides to see what happened in

184
00:11:49,070 --> 00:12:00,140
the loops but okay more transfer laid

185
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:04,490
rash ecn and nsh this is draft over in

186
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:06,650
SF see that it that is going to make use

187
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:12,100
of the congestion congestion feedback

188
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:17,240
draft we have a couple of drafts on

189
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:19,100
low-latency DOCSIS this is just FYI baba

190
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,710
believe the Bob and Greg I believe these

191
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,600
are likely headed to the independent

192
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,970
submission editor for publication

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,360
roughly as is describe what this what

194
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:32,390
this running code actually does

195
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,670
according to the chairs here and the IDS

196
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:38,770
yes but we haven't spoke to the IC

197
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:41,360
editor that's in Twiggy notes time okay

198
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,319
these documents are presented to the

199
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,210
IETF so you

200
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,280
have comments or questions about them

201
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,470
please read them if they go on the

202
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,930
independent submissions dream they are

203
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,030
not for change but the clarification and

204
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,339
understanding a feedback will be very

205
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,410
much appreciated yeah just to clarify

206
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:01,330
that they're documenting what's done in

207
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,329
DOCSIS so there's no need for the idea

208
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:12,200
there was previous work presented on

209
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:16,729
lower a number of IETF and this evolved

210
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:19,790
and this workers being now made historic

211
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:22,730
by a new internet draft which is on nqb

212
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:26,390
which will be discussed so that comes

213
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,580
back as an QB and ed Carriere documents

214
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,790
and there's a tunnel MTU considerations

215
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,830
document and empty use are so important

216
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,480
for tunnels so please read and

217
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:39,140
contribute to that there's a

218
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,750
fragmentation fragility document which

219
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,780
is proceeded through interior explaining

220
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,210
where fragmentation becomes fragile

221
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,069
under Sox protocol version 6 which is

222
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,170
being presented at many eye tests in the

223
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,020
int area and we're going to mention that

224
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,060
again here because that could be

225
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,189
something that has many transport

226
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:06,890
aspects so we'll talk about that later

227
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:10,670
in the meeting to SCTP drafts that are

228
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,790
that are being are being worked on as

229
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,620
you do submissions right now one is

230
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,589
multipath draft and the other is there's

231
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,080
a draft on the retransmission as draft

232
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,210
on the retransmission time out of

233
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,890
interest and SCTP these are out these

234
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:29,390
well perhaps please take a look comments

235
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:32,660
to the list ok so now we get to the

236
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:37,730
agenda we're going to run with agenda up

237
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,439
in a little bit the bashatt document

238
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,880
complication a testosterone review is

239
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,240
coming up next and then a bunch of

240
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,090
drafts UTP options are is expected to be

241
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,210
uh well one of the more interesting

242
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:54,530
items on the agenda tomorrow is more

243
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:55,699
drafts including l4 s and l4 s NSC ok

244
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,040
milestones would be

245
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:59,959
go through very quickly first two drafts

246
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,498
we've just talked about the objects

247
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:05,809
there with the chairs after working

248
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:08,299
group last call we need to deal with the

249
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:14,660
fragmentation text before they can be

250
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:17,540
submitted to our aging is G as for

251
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,569
publication request okay next three

252
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,248
drafts are the l4 s grass no point talk

253
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,689
about milestones here until we have the

254
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:27,439
what we're doing about the discussion

255
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:31,809
tomorrow okay we have three slot three

256
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:35,469
drafts that the intent is to try to get

257
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:40,999
get done between now and the Singapore

258
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:43,299
ITF the setp knack is probably not gonna

259
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:46,699
not gonna make that Joanne milestone

260
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:48,230
weeks I think that one it's not quite

261
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,819
ready for your glass call we'll have a

262
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,350
discussion about that a little bit the

263
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:54,410
other two drafts are believed to be

264
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,779
closer if working group glass call July

265
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:01,009
August September dates may be aggressive

266
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:02,600
all three of those are likely to t be

267
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,419
working group last call before the next

268
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,539
IETF meaning and the remaining grass the

269
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:10,129
SCTP this draft is currently estimated

270
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:12,589
for end of this year that may move out

271
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,239
and the other two gates on the other two

272
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,600
days phone just and feedback and

273
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:18,859
transfer officer for UDP are reasonable

274
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,759
guesses at this point we'll figure out

275
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:24,109
what reality looks like in Singapore

276
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:29,209
okay so here's here's here's the agenda

277
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:31,009
to go to go bash it we've mostly run

278
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,699
through item one on doggie size charter

279
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:37,129
and updates there's a Sox update that

280
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:39,498
will be coming up right right after this

281
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:42,319
then we're going to do transport

282
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,389
encryption drafts both the transport

283
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:45,469
Heather encryption impacts draft which

284
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,859
is one of the two this close for you

285
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:53,089
last call and a new draft on law suiting

286
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:55,609
for encrypted protocols SCT programs

287
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,980
there's three of them they're true

288
00:16:55,609 --> 00:17:06,289
working group last one and money is a

289
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:08,210
new draft on retransmission Datagram pmq

290
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:11,210
discovery and then

291
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,790
and then a UDP options draft we're

292
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,170
hoping you are going you got to draft is

293
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,359
there's been a lot of discussion on the

294
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,520
list we're hoping to have it have a bit

295
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,369
of design discussion and see if we can

296
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,020
chart the path forward on a number of a

297
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,989
number of the design issues that come up

298
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,960
cut the list in the AirTrain fashion new

299
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,660
work work from the writing area working

300
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,650
group on QoS management is a couple

301
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,310
couple of drafts that we talked about

302
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,890
briefly qcr and gift sir were actually

303
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,030
probably not kind of a technical

304
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:45,590
conversations draft because there's been

305
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:48,020
some updates in 3gpp IETF leadership

306
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:52,399
discussions that is likely to be a very

307
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,139
short status announcement about what

308
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,530
stay that draft is and what's going to

309
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:02,060
happen with it and then the non-coding

310
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,920
flows draft mention earlier Friday oh we

311
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:07,159
have fun this is this slide is going to

312
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,280
be interesting they'll oh let the l4s

313
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,930
crafts including are we gonna take are

314
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,270
we ready to go to work group last call

315
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,150
on them what do we need to do and

316
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,710
there's any discussion around transports

317
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,110
for elf forts and cell force is supposed

318
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,060
to enable different transport behavior

319
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:27,290
we need to discuss what what what is the

320
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:30,350
value of transports use l4s then we have

321
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,210
some cash experienced though the three

322
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,879
drives listed there discussions gonna

323
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,310
focus on the first two the TCP M draft

324
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,530
is here mostly for completeness in that

325
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,240
if SCE moves forward they're going to

326
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,460
that they're going to need to do some

327
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,620
TCP level signaling bets they grab

328
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,760
proposing how to do it I'm not Tufte

329
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:54,770
will be discussed in TCP em today

330
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:59,620
okay rest the agenda DC CP of multipath

331
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:03,590
free drafts okay any other items

332
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:06,489
anybody want to bash the agenda yet that

333
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,490
one off has been benched

334
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:27,290
no sauce it just would take socks let's

335
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:35,689
so we'll take the the stockists option

336
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:36,770
tops v6 as the next item this okay I can

337
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,140
give more history this one's being

338
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,480
presented as the heads up in this

339
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,860
working group it was presented in inter

340
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:49,180
area this time and when I put the draft

341
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,469
name up I we will ask

342
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:55,150
after a short review of what it is

343
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:59,000
whether anybody has read this document

344
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:01,580
the possibility could be that this item

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,150
is more suited to transport area than to

346
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,460
interior so I will be looking for people

347
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,760
to read this and comment on this within

348
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,760
this

349
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:33,770
hey peach dementing past firefox I know

350
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:40,559
I know the magic we're okay

351
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:44,160
okay this is the draft we're talking

352
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,440
about um it's a draft that was presented

353
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,570
in Terry this meeting has been presented

354
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,470
for use in Ontario there's a one-page

355
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:58,260
summary here which describes how the

356
00:21:52,470 --> 00:22:01,260
softs protocol provides a update to the

357
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:05,250
way stocks is handled it talks about

358
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:08,640
theorizes DTLS support extensions fire

359
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:11,790
option and how the TLS handshake is

360
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,559
handled and basically talks about

361
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,220
transport issues relating to building a

362
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,220
source proxy

363
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:27,570
could I ask if anybody has read this

364
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:31,740
document in this working group could you

365
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:38,080
please indicate if you've read it but a

366
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:40,130
previous version thank you pretty close

367
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,669
[Music]

368
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:46,559
okay but and you get the hint we would

369
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:50,850
be interested in receiving feedback on

370
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:53,520
this draft in this working group please

371
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:56,939
read please comment on the list please

372
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,170
consider this as a potential TS vwg work

373
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,760
item and please provide feedback

374
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,610
does anybody have comments on whether

375
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:11,520
this is a suitable item for work within

376
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:14,100
this working group okay I see no adverse

377
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,830
comment so please PLEASE review would

378
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:29,060
anyone like to volunteer to

379
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:30,230
this it's not that hard well we will try

380
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,909
and put pressure and we've got another

381
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,910
working group meeting to call that one

382
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:20,290
so the next item is transport encryption

383
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:23,050
: between each other person whole

384
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,600
working group we can work right so has

385
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:28,300
to be so choose yourself hi I'm Colin

386
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Perkins I'm ahsoka sinks the chairs I'm

387
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,220
pleased I'm not the only one who can't

388
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,350
work the Chromebook the hardest part of

389
00:24:33,220 --> 00:25:00,930
being a working group chair is finding

390
00:24:35,350 --> 00:25:04,840
the slides good hi I'm Colin Perkins

391
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:07,780
this is a draft that Gary and I have

392
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,060
been running for a while on the subject

393
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,639
of the impact of Transport header

394
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:17,290
confidentiality on network operation and

395
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,320
evolution of the Internet so this is the

396
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,909
the - 0-7 version there was an

397
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,189
individual version which got up to about

398
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,890
ten before I think this this has been

399
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:30,760
discussed a bunch of times here and also

400
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:32,890
in some of the operations groups so we

401
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,600
think this is pretty close to done the

402
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:37,270
changes since the last time are fairly

403
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,580
small we got a bunch of feedback on the

404
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,580
mailing list

405
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:46,179
Thomas Fossati gave us a bunch of

406
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,100
suggestions on how to clarify the text

407
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,430
primarily here talking about improving

408
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,980
the various introductory sections and

409
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:56,170
also gave some suggestions for how to

410
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:59,590
address the the issues which we raised

411
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,780
in the draft in particular he had a

412
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,550
bunch of I think really good ideas about

413
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,800
potentially using machine learning to

414
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:09,760
solve some of the problems and they'd be

415
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,870
able to identify the traffic we tend to

416
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,309
think that

417
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:17,199
well this is potentially a good idea

418
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:20,020
it's it would be expanding the draft too

419
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,540
much to add that sort of material to it

420
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,190
so so it's what we think is the right

421
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,280
thing to do here is to keep this draft

422
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:28,840
focused and identifying the problem and

423
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,340
leave other drafts to recommend

424
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,040
solutions for the problem so we just

425
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,490
don't keep this focused on this is what

426
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,550
the the concern is we also got some

427
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:44,080
comments from ridiger of intrapreneurs I

428
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:46,540
run wrong keep suggesting a bunch of

429
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,178
additional references on how operators

430
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,740
use the information you use passively

431
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:55,059
collected transfer of information to

432
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:57,780
help manage that networks we also got a

433
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:00,220
bunch of feedback from Tom Herbert

434
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,149
couple of a couple of issues here one

435
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,460
was on the the utility of adding

436
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,080
extension headers such as connects

437
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,100
headers to to carry measurement

438
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,050
information and his feedback was that he

439
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,149
believes that the draft underestimates

440
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:20,350
that the value and over States their

441
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:21,720
disadvantages I mean yeah we certainly

442
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,600
agree with him that these types of

443
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,870
mechanisms can be used to carry these

444
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,699
sort of measurements information I don't

445
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,489
think we've seen so much deployment so

446
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,809
it's hard to evaluate that but it in the

447
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:39,750
end it's a judgement call

448
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:42,639
we should if the word if the text isn't

449
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,790
if the text is too far in one direction

450
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,380
or the other we should try and align

451
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:54,909
things but hopefully we've addressed

452
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:57,580
that maybe nones 1.1 so a later version

453
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,679
of the draft update the text to be a

454
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,620
little more positive towards extension

455
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,900
headers I think we did maybe we didn't

456
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,350
if we've done that already but if we

457
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:11,950
haven't and it's still not positive it

458
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:15,309
looked a little negative also the

459
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,900
statement that something like current

460
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:18,550
data suggests that extension headers

461
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,610
don't pass it's the Internet presumably

462
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:24,710
that's referencing the the RFC that was

463
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:27,529
done I think in 2016 but a little

464
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:31,399
not fresh data so I know we won't we

465
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:33,649
need to get better data so please read

466
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,268
the latest version and check whether we

467
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:38,168
fixed it because I would be quite happy

468
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:43,879
to change that sentence to a survey in

469
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:45,889
2016 then found this so and not its

470
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:49,820
history rather than its current

471
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:51,289
relevance it's fine either way it's good

472
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,439
to reference it I mean it is a known

473
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:55,999
issue on the other hand it's a known

474
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,710
issue that we're trying to resolve there

475
00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:02,119
there are a lot of efforts to get

476
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:04,580
extension headers going in is no good at

477
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:08,779
least suggest that they give use for

478
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:10,009
point to the wording will for this will

479
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:12,470
be interesting I'm not sure I've ever

480
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:16,129
heard of the term intentional

481
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:18,769
ossification could be interesting I

482
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:21,980
don't know what to think of that I mean

483
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:24,379
the idea here is the working group or

484
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:28,279
whoever it is designing a protocol may

485
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:31,668
make an explicit statement that we are

486
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:34,879
going to declare these features of the

487
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:37,580
protocol stable for all time and you

488
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:39,889
know if you're building devices which

489
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,720
look at the protocol you you can assume

490
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:44,389
that these things will not change and we

491
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,009
reserve the rest of its to change and I

492
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:50,869
guess the quicken variants would be the

493
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:52,970
the topical example of that ultimately

494
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:55,519
when we baked something into an RFC and

495
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,590
then move it from proposed standard to

496
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,169
standard you know like we're kind of

497
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,730
doing that I mean that is literally what

498
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:05,419
we're aiming for is for things did not

499
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,769
change too much I mean yeah but I think

500
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:09,230
there's a difference between that and

501
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,700
saying the working group has made an

502
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,409
explicit commitment that we are never

503
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,480
going to change the meaning of these

504
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:19,970
bits rather than saying this is what it

505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:26,299
currently is handshake in TCP at this

506
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:28,429
point I mean good luck but I mean just a

507
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:30,049
product of its being standardized that

508
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,610
means it's not going to change it's

509
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:35,629
actually the fact that we've been using

510
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:37,820
it for 35 years yeah I think the word

511
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:40,609
ossification might be causing

512
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,529
the confusion here further down the

513
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:44,149
boats the word stability is used and I

514
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:51,649
think that's that's the point being made

515
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:55,039
here yes yes the I think that the main

516
00:30:51,649 --> 00:31:04,639
point is that the hum here comes from

517
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:06,350
devices on the path prohibiting in a way

518
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:07,879
that prohibits us from changing the

519
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:12,289
specifications in a way we want to

520
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:14,209
change and you know if if everyone is

521
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:16,249
happy that these bitch these bits are

522
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:21,349
never going to change then it doesn't

523
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:23,330
matter if devices if people build

524
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:25,059
middleboxes that you use those bits and

525
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,949
don't let us change them it's it's when

526
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:29,570
we believe that that we should be able

527
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:34,549
to change the meaning of those bits and

528
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:36,799
we can't that there is a problem so I

529
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,599
think one interesting aspect of this

530
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,789
that we want to stress is we now have

531
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:43,129
two major transport protocols to

532
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:47,720
evaluate and quic has done things

533
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:51,109
differently I believe that one of the

534
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,210
bits in the quick header was public some

535
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,949
firewall vendor decided that this fit

536
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,599
set the one all the time so I'll put in

537
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,889
my firewall that it said one all the

538
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,570
time

539
00:31:56,889 --> 00:32:03,379
classical ossification everyone to avoid

540
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:06,739
I yes yes I'm looking at quick and TCP I

541
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:09,949
think they need equal consideration now

542
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:11,119
because they are different we have much

543
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,849
more than just the two of them because

544
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:18,619
we I mean TP is is very widely deployed

545
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:21,678
for example and is running into these

546
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:25,728
ossification issues and Malthus there

547
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,619
was a time when there were some people

548
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:30,799
in a misguided effort to prevent

549
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:32,629
steganography and our protocols wrote a

550
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,609
lot of code a lot of documents and

551
00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:37,070
things said things like you have to

552
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:41,269
enforce must be 0 in your middleboxes

553
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:43,580
sure this was ugly as far as I'm

554
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:46,669
concerned it's deliberate ossification I

555
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,168
think that tone has been reduced but

556
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:50,690
there's always the opportunity for

557
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:51,170
somebody to say it's always a 1 there

558
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,940
it's always

559
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,340
zero and if it's something different

560
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,170
it's something suspicious and what has

561
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,000
made it worse is there's occasion of an

562
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,510
attack vectors where those were the

563
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,300
signatures yes so it was that a comment

564
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:08,060
on the draft or presentation on the

565
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,070
presentation we're getting a little off

566
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,980
topic but the greasing stuff is is also

567
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,929
something that hits into this space

568
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,550
right so in terms of the draft we've

569
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,610
done two revisions since the product

570
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,830
meeting zero six revised the

571
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:25,219
introductory remarks added some

572
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:27,110
discussion of the OEM related metadata

573
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,430
in Section six and updated the

574
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:34,760
conclusions made them a little more

575
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:37,250
focused the dasher seven again revised

576
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,860
the introductory remarks we removed a

577
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,980
bunch of duplication put some of that

578
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,570
text into the conclusions actually made

579
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,730
the conclusions I think we'd a lot

580
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:49,550
better and actually conclude something

581
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,990
new something that improved it and that

582
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,389
there are a bunch of other details or

583
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,980
around the rest of the drift so

584
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,880
hopefully we've now addressed all the

585
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,950
comments I believe there are a couple of

586
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,530
minor editorial mix we have outstanding

587
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:06,140
which we will get to in pretty short

588
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,850
order other than that we think the draft

589
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,400
is essentially ready for working group

590
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,440
last call so our plan was to do a

591
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,440
revision shortly after the meeting to

592
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:21,740
address the details and then we believe

593
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:23,090
this should be less calls thanks calling

594
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:25,100
I was wondering if you could talk about

595
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,710
the review that this draft has gotten

596
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:37,880
from the security area or it's pretty

597
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:39,560
area of people yes okay so we discussed

598
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,560
that last meeting because it was before

599
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,949
the last ITF we got a real security

600
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,529
review we worked through a it was quite

601
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,899
a long one which was really good we went

602
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,660
through the comments and responded to

603
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:59,150
each of them in turn and then we updated

604
00:34:53,659 --> 00:35:01,460
the document we put in text to address

605
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,410
nearly all the comments but there are a

606
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,090
couple of comments were we wrote the

607
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,950
response on the mailing list

608
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,200
why we didn't think the extra text was

609
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,450
going to be helpful in the document so

610
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,240
that's the current state with that

611
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,680
review the reviewer has got back a

612
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,930
couple of times to say that he's read

613
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,700
our comments and he's and talked to him

614
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,879
but I don't know whether he's posted an

615
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,359
update on whether he thinks the comments

616
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,180
were fully addressed on the mailing list

617
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,560
we we also had a very long discussion so

618
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,720
I think that was Chris that's Chris

619
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,370
Chris would I think this time now we had

620
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,339
a very long discussion with Steven

621
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:40,640
Farrell on an earlier version she months

622
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,410
back okay that's very good to know thank

623
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,690
you

624
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:47,930
so this document is not entirely

625
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,390
unrelated to a prior document that was

626
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:53,480
published this the draft mm WG encrypt

627
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,069
and I think it's there's like a chance

628
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,350
that some of the language in this

629
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,420
document hits the ears of people from

630
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,310
security and applications areas a little

631
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,200
bit differently than maybe people in

632
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:07,370
this room or people who work in

633
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:10,040
operations and I guess we have we have

634
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:11,710
presented it's in the ops ops area of

635
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,340
sexual I think a couple of times here

636
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,740
okay

637
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,180
to the extent that some of the same

638
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,649
concerns could be dealt with all the

639
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,750
document is still in the working group I

640
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,550
think that would that would perhaps make

641
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,560
for a smoother process than what we went

642
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,630
through with the other documents so that

643
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,070
might just mean you know advertising

644
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:30,170
widely when you're doing more than trip

645
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,720
last call or we can certainly socialize

646
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,250
this in the IHG if that would help

647
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,359
but I think it would be you know good to

648
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,140
get the feedback earlier if there's

649
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,060
gonna be feedback of similar nature at

650
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,589
the very least of brigham Glasgow will

651
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:48,080
be crossed announced to sag in the

652
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:50,090
security area and we welcome feedback

653
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,190
the idea is to build consensus on what

654
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,650
we have previously been using these

655
00:36:52,190 --> 00:37:07,460
fields for what the implications without

656
00:36:54,650 --> 00:37:08,810
going through solutions thank you do you

657
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:17,360
want to call that what the procedure is

658
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:18,380
then do trance the Chicot I'm the only

659
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,370
one who transports

660
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:25,610
focuses attention so do we Annika 400

661
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:27,650
last call for this I think the plan here

662
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,870
is that we're going to is that they'll

663
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,430
be revision in the near future and that

664
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,319
provision will go to working group last

665
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,029
call since that we're talking about

666
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,640
August it bugs me longer than the usual

667
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,830
two weeks and it will at the very least

668
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,839
be crossing the cross cross nouns to sag

669
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,630
sounds of also other other cross

670
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,280
announced at some listen the ops area

671
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:50,690
that we could will take advice maybe as

672
00:37:46,280 --> 00:38:04,160
the objects people OPSEC people at work

673
00:37:50,690 --> 00:38:05,450
were to post I'm eagerly Baca and I

674
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,000
would like to talk to you today about

675
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:11,359
packet loss signaling in encrypted

676
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,680
protocols so that's one of the issues

677
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,160
that the previous Trask of the

678
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,109
identified and so my job is to tell you

679
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,819
more about the problem gets to show that

680
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:24,290
there is a problem and propose a

681
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:26,330
solution so I'm a transport guy I like

682
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,580
to think of my networks as a collection

683
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:31,460
of very dumb pipes and then stop

684
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,170
thinking about my network but for that

685
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,990
to really work there should really be a

686
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:39,680
plumber somewhere who is trying to find

687
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:41,870
the leaks and page them and if you are

688
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,990
such a plumber if you operate a network

689
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:47,569
and somebody calls you and says I'm

690
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,609
experiencing packet loss what is the

691
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:53,240
first thing you wanna do you want to see

692
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:56,600
if you could observe the problem and

693
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,990
then you want to figure out is a loss in

694
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:04,190
my network or is it any of my peers whom

695
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:06,979
do I call so what do I do if I'm looking

696
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,020
at the TCP flow life is not that bad

697
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,630
there is a number of tools that can

698
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:14,030
absorb sequence numbers F numbers can

699
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,540
figure out where the there is loss is it

700
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:20,480
upstream downstream but if I happen to

701
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,660
be losing at quick slow

702
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,470
I mean for a very long night because by

703
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,359
design

704
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:30,200
quit doesn't give you any information

705
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,490
about not only where the loss is but

706
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,689
whether there is any loss

707
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:39,169
oh so what do I do one alternative is

708
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:43,820
just look at TCP flows between similar

709
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:47,380
endpoints use that but if that doesn't

710
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,950
work what's next you could think of

711
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,070
nuclear option

712
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:55,040
which is basically let me just block

713
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:59,570
quit entirely temporarily on that link

714
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:03,950
and forced TCP failover and troubleshoot

715
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:06,560
then well as crazy as it sounds it might

716
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:09,770
not actually work either because network

717
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,799
may treat TCP and UDP quick flows very

718
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:17,750
differently so what's next

719
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,820
now before I'm going to go further there

720
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,940
is one question that I'm asked often so

721
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,920
I'm from Akamai and people ask you're

722
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,640
not a typical network operator why do

723
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,420
you care

724
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:32,118
I mean it's somebody else's problem so

725
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,280
the way I look at it is that if you have

726
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:37,220
content on the internet if you have a

727
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,080
service you probably derive benefit and

728
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:42,230
value from it actually being available

729
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:44,690
in performant and if your CDN

730
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:48,410
that's what you are paid for to solve

731
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:51,080
all those network problems and as an

732
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:53,690
Amazon customer if my package doesn't

733
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:57,980
arrive at my desk at my at my doorstep

734
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:59,869
and they get some excuse that well

735
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:03,320
that's because some tracking company

736
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:04,070
truck ran out of gas I'm not gonna be

737
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,260
super

738
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,780
convinced with that I mean my business

739
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:14,359
relationship is this Amazon I expect

740
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:17,450
them to deliver the package so if that

741
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:20,299
was convincing we have a proposal it's

742
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:23,390
basically using two bits I'm not gonna

743
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,970
go into detail read the draft but there

744
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:30,529
is a qubit which is stands for square

745
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:34,339
signal and it's an altered it's a mark

746
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:37,580
that's alternating every N packets zeros

747
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:42,380
and ones and there is an L bit which is

748
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:45,670
a lost signal that's counting the number

749
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,950
of packets lost as determined by the

750
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,410
but protocols such as quick so for

751
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,899
example in this picture we have a number

752
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,790
of packets from sender to receiver the

753
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:58,809
red ones are lost

754
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:01,540
so one RTT to one or two or later the

755
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:06,390
protocol quickly goes out there lost and

756
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:08,589
to two future packets are sent with l1

757
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,078
how can you use the signal

758
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:13,839
well end-to-end loss is just a fraction

759
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:17,230
of packets you observe with l equals 1

760
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,990
up stream loss is a fraction of the

761
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,809
packets in each q blog that are missing

762
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:26,529
packets downstream loss you can figure

763
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:28,799
out from the other two so you can notice

764
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:32,950
but we don't specifically talk about

765
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:33,670
where to put those two bits it's being

766
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,098
proposed

767
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:39,299
everything from IP header to quick

768
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:43,030
header and really anything in between

769
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:45,509
the purpose of this draft is to point

770
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:49,510
out the problem propose a solution

771
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:51,490
framework using the two bits and once we

772
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,619
have consensus on that I'm sure we can

773
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:58,299
work and draft in the appropriate group

774
00:42:53,619 --> 00:43:00,640
that will find the home for the bits so

775
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:03,460
this is not a purely theoretical work

776
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,740
Akamai that actually implemented this

777
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,809
scheme in our production servers and

778
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,359
we've been serving traffic like that a

779
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:12,460
quick traffic for a while to a number of

780
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:16,089
orange customers in different countries

781
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:18,069
we have data for this and tomorrow it

782
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:20,710
mapper G will be talking a lot more

783
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:24,119
about data from different countries what

784
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:27,730
the data means for those who are curious

785
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:34,000
we used the two most significant bits of

786
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:35,440
apt GL to help to carry those bits it

787
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,530
worked

788
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,990
now the encrypted protocols do what they

789
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:45,910
do for a reason so one of the important

790
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:48,368
reasons is and user privacy and the

791
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:51,058
proposal we have is trying very hard to

792
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:53,470
make sure that nothing more is compress

793
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:56,829
disclosed to the network then what quick

794
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:59,410
already discloses so separate counters

795
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:01,750
for each flow sub flow separate count

796
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:05,078
fresh portable separate counter for each

797
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:08,079
connection a diem the other important

798
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:12,160
things that encrypted protocols like

799
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:16,000
quick worry about is particle

800
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,640
ossification resistance and because loss

801
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,039
signaling is not an integral part of the

802
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,660
protocol it's very convenient to

803
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,030
basically do what quit does already with

804
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:32,160
a spin bit with a latency spin bit which

805
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:35,339
is say that 20% of connections must use

806
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,879
pseudo-random basically random looking

807
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:42,849
garbage in those bits it's very easy for

808
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,660
observer to tell a real signal from no

809
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:50,200
signal and for middleboxes there's a

810
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:54,069
incentive to not pacify on that so

811
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:58,779
that's all I have for today please get

812
00:44:54,069 --> 00:45:01,000
in touch with us my my goal for the

813
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,130
future is to make sure we have a robust

814
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,460
discussion about it in the on the

815
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:08,500
mailing list he already started and

816
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:12,430
later on we'll see if we can get

817
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:16,660
consensus and get it in adopted and then

818
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:24,279
work on the actual draft that will find

819
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:28,029
the home for those bits extremely quick

820
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:29,619
so I just wanted to point out to Collin

821
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:31,329
if he's here that I think it'll be a

822
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:33,190
great interest to the quantum internet

823
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:42,450
research group to see qubits and use in

824
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:46,450
transport protocols ok two quick points

825
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:48,160
one is I think this is great but I

826
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,779
wonder what else there is like what

827
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,549
other information people are gonna want

828
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:53,680
like what if I want to spike in latency

829
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:55,270
so I'm worried if you get a mouse a

830
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,828
piece of cheese and on the glass of milk

831
00:45:55,270 --> 00:46:00,119
and all that so I could see this

832
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:03,640
becoming the avalanche part 2 of that is

833
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:06,910
protocol agnostic mechanisms much better

834
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,859
than protocol specific so it you know

835
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,118
quick has a few bits but what about the

836
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:12,430
next protocol and the next one after

837
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:14,770
that and how do we get the unified

838
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:16,720
mechanism saved your so I also not that

839
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,130
this is one presentation in their space

840
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,500
there are other people who could have

841
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:24,160
presented this ITF on topics that are

842
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:26,410
stream Li related so yeah thank you for

843
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,930
the general comment that's good

844
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,810
Martin Duke I actually want to make the

845
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,919
opposite point if it actually isn't a

846
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,420
quick header then of course it's

847
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,210
authenticated I'm wondering if you

848
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,250
thought through the threat bottles if we

849
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,620
put it in the IP header where anyone can

850
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,900
mess with those bits

851
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:47,160
well that's yes I actually did think

852
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:49,990
about it and well as you see in our

853
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:53,379
current thing we do mess with IP header

854
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:55,600
bit it's not it's not going to be any

855
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,880
different from what people can do right

856
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,980
now so but if it goes into a quick

857
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,870
header it true it will be authenticated

858
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:05,590
and it will not be subject to

859
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:08,710
manipulation by by the pass so there are

860
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:11,140
advantages and disadvantages to any of

861
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:15,340
the proposals so I can that's why we

862
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:17,200
don't directly dive into pics the header

863
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,910
right now I want to make sure that

864
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,859
people understand that there is a

865
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,950
problem and that we need to solve it and

866
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,900
this is a method to solve it and you can

867
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,689
have a discussion about trade-offs

868
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:31,570
between different headers that's a good

869
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:34,210
discussion I would love to have it some

870
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:37,540
suggested maybe I missed it in your

871
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:40,900
response but it are the having thought

872
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:43,860
about the threat model do you see any

873
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:47,410
serious problems with putting it in an

874
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:50,380
authenticated if the sender is playing

875
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:53,140
fair and keeping separate counters for

876
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,690
each sub flow each quick connection eg

877
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:59,470
if it's quick I don't think through the

878
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:03,490
threat model in that sense that's that's

879
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:07,689
my thing that's my understanding only

880
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:11,649
short consideration Muraki Celia from

881
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:17,040
Telecom Italia I suggested to the

882
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:21,130
reference to FAC 8321 your draft that is

883
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:25,329
the receipt at the finest querer waiver

884
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:29,319
to measure per clause and the user case

885
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:32,920
that you put two different points okay

886
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:37,049
yes okay two different Yusuke that you

887
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:39,369
use two different measurement point to

888
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:42,519
understand the packet loss inside the

889
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:45,779
network so you can definitely do more

890
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:49,258
and so this is using just one probe just

891
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:52,239
kept looking at one direction of traffic

892
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:54,910
once you identify look do that and you

893
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,160
identify which direction the loss is you

894
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:59,979
could move the probe or have another one

895
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:05,170
already available that's just another

896
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:06,489
way to use in the technique we do this

897
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:15,160
for nearly twenty minutes behind

898
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:17,049
schedule closing all right thirdly I'll

899
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,999
just have you looked at the congestion

900
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:21,069
exposure work the konnex work it seems

901
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:25,299
to be quite a lot of similarity with the

902
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:30,190
ideas going on yep thank you see Thanks

903
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:31,779
so that's the classic example of

904
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:34,349
bringing a topic up that should be

905
00:49:31,779 --> 00:49:36,819
continued on the list please think about

906
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:39,130
implications please think about which

907
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:41,499
header bits could appear in please think

908
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:54,839
about requirements please talk to the

909
00:49:41,499 --> 00:49:54,839
authors please discuss Michael

910
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:08,359
hello my name is Michael Jackson I'm

911
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:11,539
talking about about RC 4960 biz that's

912
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:17,630
the base back for SCTP we have an RC

913
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:23,660
describing lungs large set of Hirata's

914
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:27,589
and how do I switch to die okay just

915
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:30,589
next slide and that's the status so the

916
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:32,869
first revision zero zero of the draft

917
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:36,019
was just to move from end off from the

918
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:41,209
end of tool chain which was Houston when

919
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:43,999
producing RC 460 to the xml stuff done

920
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:46,209
in a way that it the text version looks

921
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:48,618
as similar as possible

922
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:50,719
now the first version was the identical

923
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:53,949
version the second or one version was

924
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:57,949
switching to xml with minor differences

925
00:50:53,949 --> 00:51:02,269
the version o two integrates all the

926
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:05,449
Aurora's from the errata document so

927
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:08,709
that's all that changes we sort of

928
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:12,890
agreed on an RC eight five four zero

929
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:15,589
there's some stuff which needed changes

930
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:18,288
like updating references to RFC's which

931
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:22,788
have been updated and some editorial

932
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:28,279
stuff which is in the O 3 version what

933
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:31,449
is in progress is the fourth version and

934
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:36,859
this comes back to a comment from Gauri

935
00:51:31,449 --> 00:51:41,319
we used and 4960 a lot of may must

936
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:46,160
should not in capital letter and the

937
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:48,019
request was to remove this stuff to

938
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,910
either capital letter mast or a

939
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:53,419
different wordings so that when you read

940
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:57,348
the text you are not arguing whether

941
00:51:53,420 --> 00:52:00,739
this cabot wherever this must is meant

942
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:04,789
as a mandatory language or not this is

943
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:07,789
right now in the github repo we need to

944
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:09,319
go once again to the other changes to

945
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:11,770
make sure everything's fine and then it

946
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:15,610
will be submitted what's left

947
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:18,940
is one issue brought up on the github

948
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:23,350
tracker which is related to setting up

949
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:26,470
SATP associations so if an endpoint

950
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:30,759
knows multiple IP addresses of the peer

951
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:32,770
the current API and 4960 only allows you

952
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,960
to provide one of these addresses to the

953
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:39,430
associate primitive and then set up the

954
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:41,619
Association the socket API allows you to

955
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:43,680
provide this list of errors as to the

956
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:48,250
end point and then it already uses

957
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:51,368
multiple addresses to doing them as a

958
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:55,930
session set up and this is a feature

959
00:52:51,369 --> 00:53:00,190
which is requested by operators and when

960
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:01,660
they try to talk to vendors and vendors

961
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,610
come up and say well this is not

962
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:10,810
specified there so we don't have to do

963
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:13,690
it and so we will update the text of the

964
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:15,970
API section replacing the single IP

965
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:19,210
address we are providing by a list of IP

966
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:22,270
address we are providing making clear

967
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:24,490
that it is informational only adding a

968
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,890
link to the socket API stuff and add

969
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:30,009
some text to the document saying if you

970
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:34,118
know you set up a list of IP addresses

971
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:39,960
make you go miss may use of make use of

972
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:43,619
them the last thing is sort of layout

973
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:48,100
improvements the XML code reads ugly

974
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:52,060
just to just that the text version looks

975
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:56,520
like 4960 and that will be cleared up at

976
00:53:52,060 --> 00:54:01,000
the last step to look okay in HTML and

977
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:03,850
text but not yes but not identical to

978
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,160
4960 so the idea is that you can go

979
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:09,730
through the data tracker compare the

980
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:12,609
revisions and can double check what has

981
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:15,190
changed and you know exactly from the

982
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:19,650
versions one whether it's only editorial

983
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:19,650
or is content changing

984
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:24,939
[Music]

985
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:30,349
couple of questions first question is

986
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:33,039
and there was another drug and uploaded

987
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:35,960
the talk about next-generation SCTP and

988
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,579
yeah this was an individual draft it's

989
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,490
been around for a while is there

990
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:43,339
anything in there which needs to be put

991
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:46,160
into this document have you listed so

992
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:49,339
that document lists a couple of issues

993
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:54,379
one of the point well a couple of points

994
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:56,450
that one point is to integrate almost

995
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,819
all extensions we have right now and the

996
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:01,970
base back I don't think that's a good

997
00:54:58,819 --> 00:55:05,630
idea except for one document the i--but

998
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:07,970
which was integrated in this the other

999
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:12,859
stuff listed there is either additional

1000
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:15,109
work or changing concepts you've read it

1001
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:17,720
I've read it and I don't think anything

1002
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:20,750
applies here except the iPad which is

1003
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,520
done that's fine if the working group

1004
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:25,039
thinks that there are additions to this

1005
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,359
document these and either come to the

1006
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,539
Mike on let us know on the mailing list

1007
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:31,690
because this document is meant to be a

1008
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:33,529
stable document that reflects

1009
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:37,130
implementations and our best

1010
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:39,829
understanding of this standard so please

1011
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:41,539
speak up at this stage if you think

1012
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:43,220
there's anything extra needs to be added

1013
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:44,599
to it does anybody wish to comment in

1014
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,000
the room about something that they think

1015
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:53,900
should be added into this revision of

1016
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:56,539
the spec then when will you be ready to

1017
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,339
continue to publish the next revision

1018
00:55:56,539 --> 00:56:01,039
which should be one that is clean while

1019
00:55:58,339 --> 00:56:04,779
you're the next version will include the

1020
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:07,220
must since its so we have the texture I

1021
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:11,180
think I will charge to make some

1022
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:13,308
tomorrow and then we can submit it okay

1023
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:16,038
shortly make making clear that we go

1024
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:20,059
read it to catch things but we can fix

1025
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:21,319
that later okay heads up man speak with

1026
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:23,779
me if you think those new additions

1027
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:26,890
needed be ready to review this please if

1028
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:26,890
your interest in SCTP

1029
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:46,288
so learning young should be the net

1030
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:54,900
document yeah you can go to the next

1031
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:57,210
slide yes so this document was sort of

1032
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:02,299
considered ready for working up a score

1033
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:05,279
by the authors then two people read it

1034
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:11,480
pretty detailed and Gloria was one of

1035
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:17,009
them and he made a number of editorial

1036
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:20,789
and clarification things and one remark

1037
00:57:17,009 --> 00:57:24,269
in particular basically split making it

1038
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:26,880
clear for an endpoint developer or a

1039
00:57:24,269 --> 00:57:35,788
middle box developer which sections

1040
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:37,890
apply to that role so we have common

1041
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:42,150
text explaining these things we have

1042
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:44,308
common text giving examples but where we

1043
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:47,519
describe what needs to be implemented

1044
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:49,940
it's made clear in the headers of the

1045
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,308
section or subsection whether this is a

1046
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:56,190
consideration for endpoint implementers

1047
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:58,769
or middle box implementers that's

1048
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:02,489
integrated so I think I addressed

1049
00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:02,879
everything Gauri reported thank you for

1050
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:04,589
doing that

1051
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,789
I've read it I used to do what you

1052
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:13,680
saying okay and Maxim also provided a

1053
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:17,089
detailed review he has 63 comments most

1054
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:23,249
so I talked to him in person

1055
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:25,200
most the comments with most impact we

1056
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:29,308
discussed and came to the conclusion

1057
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,558
that they will not be integrated some of

1058
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:33,210
them was like ideas doing it in a

1059
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,789
different doing the stuff in a different

1060
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:40,289
way and we discussed why we doing it in

1061
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:42,470
that way the other Commons at least as

1062
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:45,280
indicated by Maxim are some

1063
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:48,220
clarifications editorial staff

1064
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,770
maybe missing a reference missing some

1065
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:56,339
birding that will be addressed at the

1066
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:56,339
next drive questions

1067
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:13,359
please complete this long going piece of

1068
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:24,549
work so we can publish it okay next up

1069
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:28,509
Watson okay hello my maxim portion and

1070
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:32,349
this is the state status update on not

1071
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:35,530
the CTP work that I presented basically

1072
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:39,730
in the previous idea so I will quickly

1073
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:43,390
go through situation and proposal and

1074
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:46,380
mainly focus on updates and approved so

1075
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:50,290
the the problem that we try to solve is

1076
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:52,630
well-known is that if Yuri transmit data

1077
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:54,339
chunk and you get acknowledgment back

1078
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,770
you cannot distinguish if it

1079
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:59,259
acknowledged its original recent data or

1080
00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:01,060
it transmitted to one and there are

1081
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,819
basically two use cases when you have

1082
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,920
real loss or when you have spurious

1083
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:10,390
retransmission

1084
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:13,930
next slide so the idea is quite

1085
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:17,980
straightforward we want to use one bit

1086
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:20,460
in data or write data to indicate that

1087
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:22,569
this is retransmission and

1088
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:27,160
acknowledgement on retransmission should

1089
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:32,160
also include that bit and we thought

1090
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:39,848
about different ideas more bits may be

1091
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:41,980
new suck that will be more complicated

1092
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:44,099
but we came to conclusion that this is a

1093
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:49,750
simplest approach that addresses all our

1094
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:54,069
use cases we need so this users of this

1095
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:56,829
bit requires a negotiation and basically

1096
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:57,950
there are two main rules the first row

1097
01:00:56,829 --> 01:01:00,290
for the

1098
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:02,299
under that it should set they are beat

1099
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:06,470
every time a tree transmits data data

1100
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:08,570
and the sender must immediately respond

1101
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:13,149
by socket orbit when it receives state

1102
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:13,150
or identity that bit set next slide

1103
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:21,320
so since last ITF I've submitted a new

1104
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:23,119
draft version where I added the

1105
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,140
description of HTTP improvements from

1106
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,349
this mechanism

1107
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:30,529
this was main feedback that I received

1108
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:32,630
there and I will describe it in next

1109
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:34,940
slide I also added some clarifications

1110
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:37,160
about the issue with multiple

1111
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,369
retransmission retransmission which is

1112
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,029
one of the challenges for this mechanism

1113
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:42,440
because when you have multiple

1114
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,940
transmissions and you get

1115
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,300
acknowledgments back you cannot

1116
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:48,500
distinguish one but still it brings

1117
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:50,210
improvement because you can distinguish

1118
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:53,750
a regional transmission and you can

1119
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:59,390
still detect spurious retransmissions so

1120
01:01:53,750 --> 01:02:03,380
this still have some improvement and I

1121
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:04,848
also made some editorial updates we also

1122
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:06,410
implemented the negotiation you can

1123
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:09,260
easily know implementation previously it

1124
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:11,750
was some proprietary mechanism but it's

1125
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:14,960
not yet in the live network I think it

1126
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:18,050
will be the end of this year we started

1127
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,810
collection of data it was requested last

1128
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:23,690
time I think we focus on signal traffic

1129
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:27,290
profiles to show the improvement so I

1130
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:31,819
hope you'll present next time and yeah

1131
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:34,730
we continue to probability linux's TV so

1132
01:02:31,819 --> 01:02:38,300
this is what can be improved if we use

1133
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:40,609
this retransmit bit so there are some

1134
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,950
mechanisms already in SCTP that will be

1135
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:44,420
improved up to your calculation powerful

1136
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:49,569
textual quick failover

1137
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:53,420
where you have issued this ambiguous

1138
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:55,310
acknowledgement the other big carry that

1139
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:57,290
can be improved this detection of spirit

1140
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:58,819
transmissions because when you get when

1141
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:01,759
you have sphericity transmission and you

1142
01:02:58,819 --> 01:03:05,660
get sucked back without our bit you can

1143
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,579
already that time understand that there

1144
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:09,460
was a spirit retransmission you can

1145
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:11,410
react accordingly you can

1146
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:14,800
at least until fire application about

1147
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:18,160
that or you can adjust your settings

1148
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:20,349
because one of the common issue is some

1149
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,578
kind of miss configuration of mini-mario

1150
01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:26,770
and shock delay parameters that leads to

1151
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:31,390
spurious retransmissions in network or

1152
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:33,130
you can even recover your congestion

1153
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,990
state because when you do spurious

1154
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:37,630
retransmissions you basically reduce

1155
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:39,700
congestion variables and when you detect

1156
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:42,220
that there was a spirit spirit a

1157
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:44,078
transmission you can recover it the

1158
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:46,750
other big area which where we use this

1159
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:49,390
mechanism is so-called population of

1160
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:51,760
moccasin mark delay it's also to prevent

1161
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:55,180
spurious retransmissions it's similar to

1162
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,220
how it's done in quick but I mean the

1163
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:59,618
idea is that you dynamically calculate

1164
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:01,779
calculate maximum delay and if but if

1165
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:04,869
you carry transmissions in the existent

1166
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,849
mechanism it's it brings some problems

1167
01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:10,690
you should always be able to distinguish

1168
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:16,000
between what stock actually acknowledges

1169
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:18,069
like slide so implementation status is

1170
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,619
almost the same as it was before so we

1171
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:23,529
have it in Ericsson a CTP it enabled

1172
01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:25,359
between Ericsson STP endpoints we have

1173
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,430
also local path for linux st petes

1174
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:29,740
without negotiation mainly used for in

1175
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,839
two previous tests so improvements are

1176
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:37,660
implemented in ours to be not in that

1177
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:41,259
patch next slide my plan is to close all

1178
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:43,899
DVDs in the next version I think it's

1179
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:46,240
two or three of them we has already

1180
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:48,790
mentioned we plan to share some data of

1181
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:51,399
these improvements there are different

1182
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:54,160
use cases not only be spurious

1183
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:57,970
retransmissions but also some other use

1184
01:04:54,160 --> 01:05:01,450
cases and we spent in into probability

1185
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:04,240
with linux SCTP and if i mean there is

1186
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:07,270
interest in this work we want to adopt

1187
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,000
it in the world okay so what's your

1188
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:12,640
intention for this traffic networking

1189
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,930
group work through these plans and then

1190
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,558
ask you working group adoption of the

1191
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:16,990
next revision

1192
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,880
yes ok we'll make a note of that and

1193
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:20,109
we'll probably see probably see this

1194
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,520
back on the agenda in Singapore right

1195
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:26,430
yeah sounds good

1196
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:29,310
anybody have any questions but please

1197
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:31,649
read the draft team we expected to be on

1198
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:35,940
the agenda in Singapore so if you're

1199
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:37,170
interested SCTP please ask questions

1200
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,860
this one is obviously interested in a

1201
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:43,080
CTP mikerickson one question do you need

1202
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:47,490
do you need a negotiation or can you

1203
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:49,890
just I mean you can set the out of it

1204
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:51,359
it's ignored by the receiver

1205
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:54,060
if he doesn't answer if he doesn't

1206
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:58,020
understand it so it's the negotiation

1207
01:05:54,060 --> 01:06:00,960
yeah I mean if you set our bit in your

1208
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,970
center side you still want to know that

1209
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,390
the other side will send you suck with

1210
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:08,609
our bid because otherwise if you get

1211
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:11,910
sake doubt orbit you can mistakenly

1212
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:18,120
think that you're okay first original

1213
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:19,980
scent was okay you need oh I mean in our

1214
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:24,089
current implementation we just use the

1215
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:27,720
second bit to negotiate so to say I mean

1216
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:31,830
the sender the receiver always sets that

1217
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:33,569
bit to show that I support this but we

1218
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:37,230
don't want to use the second be just I

1219
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:39,750
mean to do not waste it as David said it

1220
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:41,880
looks like a good plan it looks like

1221
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,650
there might be benefit but the question

1222
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,550
is is it was the complexity so please

1223
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:52,330
come on tell us

1224
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:54,130
next okay yeah okay thank you hi

1225
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:57,790
Gouri first as an individual talking

1226
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:59,560
about DPL PM PUD wasn't sure whether you

1227
01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:05,310
could have killed slides or not so this

1228
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:08,799
idea have got colorful um DPL PMT UD has

1229
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:13,509
changed significantly in that it's used

1230
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:16,240
the new markup language for RFC XML and

1231
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:20,170
therefore we have some SVG diagrams in

1232
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,390
and thanks Magnus fer inviting us to

1233
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:24,820
join this experiment and all the

1234
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:26,529
diagrams that are being rendered to SVG

1235
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:28,480
go look at the HTML version and you'll

1236
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:31,690
see the effect of using the new format

1237
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:34,510
we moved Appendix A because Appendix A

1238
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:36,730
had been introduced and was useful to us

1239
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:39,100
going through but really was a

1240
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:42,490
duplication that became less less and

1241
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:44,140
less easy to justify because it was just

1242
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:46,390
a representation the same thing it's

1243
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:49,299
gone it's no longer there removed a

1244
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:52,870
section on DPL PM tud with UDP options

1245
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:56,650
and we put it in a separate draft we

1246
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:58,390
will we've no taught to our ad and we

1247
01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:00,130
probably will refresh this draft and

1248
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:02,650
keep this active so that we can capture

1249
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:06,580
what happens when you use UDP options

1250
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:07,870
with this and we don't intend to put

1251
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,600
that back into this particular document

1252
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:13,000
we'll keep it as a separate item and we

1253
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:15,310
shortened the description of phases we

1254
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,830
introduced the idea of phase did help

1255
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:21,729
people understand an overview of how the

1256
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:24,970
algorithm worked um we really want that

1257
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:27,279
to be a discussion of issues concerning

1258
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:29,740
the whole way in which this works are

1259
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,870
not going into the details of the state

1260
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:38,200
machine so we will probably shorten this

1261
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:40,180
yet further and I'm not aware of oh I

1262
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:43,358
want you to draw a picture and this is

1263
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:45,640
what it looked like before and this is

1264
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,670
what it looks like now see if you think

1265
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,690
that looks better

1266
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:56,080
before after

1267
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:58,419
okay whatever before was better yeah you

1268
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:01,630
can get the test version are you playing

1269
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:05,830
to be a poster child for for SVG in the

1270
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:08,080
new RFC for Mac I mean yeah right and

1271
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:10,660
you could talk about the implication of

1272
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:12,370
that okay so no serious they want to

1273
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:14,108
keep this shot and we think the state

1274
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,729
machines stable and usable we presented

1275
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:18,160
that last IETF we haven't discovered

1276
01:09:15,729 --> 01:09:20,049
anything to change our mind we are still

1277
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,870
gathering experience with paths and

1278
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:25,330
methods there will be research issues

1279
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:27,399
come out of this because we don't quite

1280
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:29,229
know how the internet works but we

1281
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:34,330
believe the method that's proposed here

1282
01:09:29,229 --> 01:09:36,549
is finished as a framework we believe it

1283
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:39,130
is finished as a set of states we

1284
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:40,570
believe it's finished and we will be

1285
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:43,569
updating the draft so we're not asking

1286
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:45,969
for working group last call next this is

1287
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:48,130
we will be asking it for it before the

1288
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:50,320
next one as we finish the document we

1289
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:52,120
have some author comments to still

1290
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,920
resolve we're still willing to take

1291
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,230
feedback so if you have any questions or

1292
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,330
feedback please tell us if you have a

1293
01:09:56,230 --> 01:10:00,910
new implementation please tell us we

1294
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:02,980
know four different implementations in

1295
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:04,720
different ways of this if you've got an

1296
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:08,860
idea of implanting it please talk to us

1297
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:10,480
please tell us okay couple process notes

1298
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:13,059
as Cory said expect this to be last call

1299
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:16,599
of working with glass quadraphonic IETF

1300
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:19,630
and on the first slide the removal of

1301
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:22,060
the UDP options mature a separate draft

1302
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:24,190
was an executive decision by your

1303
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:26,380
working group chairs to move this draft

1304
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:29,710
along and hopefully get it published and

1305
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:31,930
stable without waiting for UDP options

1306
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:34,000
which as you're about to see is going to

1307
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:39,990
need some work in mate and and they and

1308
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,990
may take a while any other questions

1309
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:45,670
does anybody

1310
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:51,820
the reason that the a recent version of

1311
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:57,790
this please read it for the next IETF

1312
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:59,620
where we're about to finish this so I

1313
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:02,140
can't say write it but I did have one

1314
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,240
question there's an implementation of

1315
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:07,240
this yeah this for there were four

1316
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:10,389
there's four attempts there's a freebsd

1317
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,950
work which is on the gate it's not being

1318
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:15,520
up streamed because it won't be until

1319
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:17,139
the specs finished there is UDP options

1320
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,510
which is our test implementation which

1321
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:21,780
were keeping up to date which is again

1322
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:23,920
on get there has been another

1323
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:26,410
implementation I do you want to talk

1324
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,120
about yours and we did it one in most

1325
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:31,690
quick the hackathon just to prove it

1326
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:33,130
could be done in Moss quick okay I think

1327
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:34,839
it's helpful to put implementation

1328
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:36,640
information in the draft if you haven't

1329
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,400
already good good good to have a

1330
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,690
reference go we I don't know what we'll

1331
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,309
do but we definitely win the Shepherd

1332
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,960
right up because we'll have to send that

1333
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:46,440
as the working group progresses it I'm

1334
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,580
not sure we'll put it in the draft

1335
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:52,629
microphone regarding the implementations

1336
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:55,780
we have one demo application which runs

1337
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:57,640
over UDP where we do the message flows

1338
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:00,250
and the other honest we have sort of

1339
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:03,970
code for HTTP for a bit of an older

1340
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:05,740
version doing this an SDP SCTP he's been

1341
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:08,350
doing something like this for quite a

1342
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:10,170
while which is why we've been basing

1343
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:24,930
this on fact rather than just fiction

1344
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:27,460
yes use it in our web RTC thank you I'm

1345
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:30,210
trying to come to your touch I guess

1346
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,210
it's alright

1347
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:43,840
so jokes are able to make this

1348
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,220
particular meeting

1349
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:53,290
Joel's in LA I believe it's sunnier and

1350
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:57,340
warmer but I'm going to try and

1351
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:59,410
summarize your slides and Jose and

1352
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:01,930
seeing rather a lot of comments on the

1353
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:04,210
list in the in the last period and

1354
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:07,270
particularly just prior to the IETF and

1355
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:09,600
he has a number of pending updates and

1356
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:12,780
[Music]

1357
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,370
these there's no wordsmithing and

1358
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:18,550
various things to be done right and

1359
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:21,160
there's updates particularly on the use

1360
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:24,760
of the OCS which is this checksum over

1361
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:26,590
the options area um it appears be a nice

1362
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,900
thing to be able to check the validity

1363
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:32,440
of the options but as we discussed in

1364
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:34,030
previous TSV meetings this is important

1365
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,280
for traversing middleboxes that do

1366
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:37,719
strange things with checksums and if you

1367
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,790
don't do this then you don't get through

1368
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,410
the middle box and even more frightening

1369
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,240
if you don't do this you don't get

1370
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:44,769
through some of the host adapters which

1371
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:48,309
off Lord and then check into

1372
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:50,530
incompatible ways so please add the OCS

1373
01:13:48,310 --> 01:14:00,010
was a request made to joe and jaws they

1374
01:13:50,530 --> 01:14:02,050
made it mandatory I think the the

1375
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:03,700
primary issue is worked I mean a crucial

1376
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:06,010
but the crucial texture there bracelet

1377
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:08,500
and bond agreement on is the EB checksum

1378
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:12,370
is nonzero then you have to use then you

1379
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:15,220
have to use use OCS we have some corner

1380
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:18,880
cases in the tunnels area where the UDP

1381
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:22,120
checksum is 0-2 now now lock which will

1382
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:26,740
work which will will will work out in

1383
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:28,809
the list okay so I think this reflects

1384
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:30,519
discussion on the list and if you

1385
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:32,290
disagree with what's written in the site

1386
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,540
then please bring it up again on the

1387
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:38,470
list and Joe will produce a new revision

1388
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:40,510
for the OCS work and there's a request

1389
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:44,560
on the list that length of options

1390
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:47,560
should be increased so you can declare

1391
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:51,130
options that are longer than 254 bites

1392
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:54,100
um this seems like an odd thing to want

1393
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:56,970
to do but one of the uses of UDP options

1394
01:14:54,100 --> 01:15:01,330
is to send fragments and possibly other

1395
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:03,820
data in the options space so this limit

1396
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:06,550
becomes a silly limit when you're doing

1397
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:08,710
using this for fragmentation for those

1398
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:11,020
of you who don't recollect the story we

1399
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:13,780
put the fragments into the option space

1400
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:15,700
and because we don't want them to be

1401
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,889
inadvertently delivered by a UDP

1402
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:20,889
receiver that doesn't know how options

1403
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:23,230
work so this protects them from being

1404
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:25,780
delivered by accident and it requires a

1405
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:27,879
longer option jaw recently announced

1406
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:29,950
that the length field of 255 would

1407
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:31,960
indicate that the length is followed by

1408
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:36,429
a 2-byte length field which gives us up

1409
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:37,870
to 64 kilobytes of options please don't

1410
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:40,870
use that much I'm pretty sure that won't

1411
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:43,240
work but it's big enough and we don't

1412
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:54,250
support jumbo grams and but that's

1413
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:57,090
another story and I can't move no okay

1414
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:59,680
so there's a there's been a lot of

1415
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:04,240
looking at this draft and how it works

1416
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:05,980
and there was talk about the structure

1417
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:09,580
of the options field the options field

1418
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:14,379
is a kind of value in turn as in tcp tcp

1419
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:15,700
options kind and all these previous

1420
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:20,190
slides this is this is an outline on

1421
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:20,190
what's coming so ok so i just go forward

1422
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:34,080
ok this is no mostly from joe of stuff

1423
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:36,040
we'll need to get back to which is that

1424
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:39,220
with some of the similar suffering

1425
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:42,640
mucking with are going to have some

1426
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:43,690
impacts on options and option processing

1427
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:48,640
to take care one of the things you're

1428
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:50,650
gonna hear on on use of can't use of

1429
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,540
kind is going an impact process just a

1430
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:55,500
heads up that we're gonna have to go

1431
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:58,030
look carefully at that processing text

1432
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:01,330
ok so

1433
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:03,730
this is Joel's position yeah all right

1434
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:07,030
you want me go go go try try try try the

1435
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:08,980
first one since this on which saying

1436
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:12,700
I'll first start and the original

1437
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:15,580
options filled Remick mimic tcp options

1438
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:20,080
rather than ipv6 options so all options

1439
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:22,210
were just options in ipv6 the the

1440
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,130
indicator allows you to have a flag

1441
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:27,100
which indicates that the option is

1442
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:29,020
critical and that impacts the processing

1443
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,430
of options and the question was can we

1444
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:32,140
have something a little bit similar to

1445
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:34,420
this and tom was a part of the

1446
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:43,930
discussion other people also on Joe's

1447
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:47,350
response is this David your queue so the

1448
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:50,740
this is about where it says word says

1449
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:54,190
must support flag so there's there's two

1450
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:56,650
things going on there that we need that

1451
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:58,540
we're going to need need to try try to

1452
01:17:56,650 --> 01:18:04,540
contrite ooh get a spectrum the first

1453
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:07,990
one is Joe's been quite adamant that you

1454
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:10,030
can't have the crucial thing here is you

1455
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:12,160
get a critical option it's marked as

1456
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:16,570
must be understood and you don't

1457
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:19,300
understand it the first bullet says that

1458
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:21,790
not understand an option can't result in

1459
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:23,620
packet drop because a legacy receiver

1460
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:27,310
won't even know to look for the option

1461
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:31,380
isn't going to drop the packet any

1462
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:31,380
objection to that view in the room

1463
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,640
seeing no objection I think Tom should

1464
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:38,710
tell her but she had quit coming to this

1465
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:42,100
cuz he it was his point that started

1466
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:45,880
this discussion one clarification what

1467
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:47,740
is the what is the expected discussion

1468
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:51,040
here so we're trying to resolve the

1469
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:52,900
issues here or everything that you hear

1470
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:55,480
will go to the list I'm looking for a

1471
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:58,179
sense of the room here so that we have

1472
01:18:55,480 --> 01:19:03,900
some idea of where where we're going

1473
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:06,370
from here Jill summary slides up let me

1474
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:10,320
hear what others have to say yes sure

1475
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:13,740
let's fine yeah man

1476
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:17,370
I'm worried because I haven't read

1477
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:19,950
enough of this stuff but it seems that

1478
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:22,380
this prescription requires rewriting

1479
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:26,429
packets in places where you might not

1480
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:28,380
want to redo do that is that true in

1481
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:31,950
will drop the headers without dropping

1482
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:34,050
the no no no this is this is this is

1483
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:36,990
your behaviors the receiver has received

1484
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:38,880
a valid UDP packet the payloads fine

1485
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:40,889
receiver so it's going at the options

1486
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,960
area and says hmm I understand this we

1487
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:45,300
are saying that what this one what nerd

1488
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,360
is this whoops it's got a critical

1489
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:51,060
indication and I don't understand it the

1490
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:55,559
the first thing we just went through was

1491
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:57,270
that if this happens but most you can do

1492
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,560
is toss all the options here on the

1493
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,730
floor you can't drop a packet because

1494
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,100
you didn't understand some of the

1495
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:07,650
options area

1496
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:09,270
from Jasmer only Mike heard yes thank

1497
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:15,929
you oh well thank you yes I figured I

1498
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:19,320
knew that was my position - best illness

1499
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:20,910
individual I'm also fine with I mean I

1500
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,059
think that's the right chase - yes

1501
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:27,120
dropped option on that was part one part

1502
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:29,010
part two is you've just I've already

1503
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:33,120
given the game away we've had some

1504
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:36,510
discussion on the list about whether to

1505
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,880
put in a critical indication of some

1506
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:40,800
sort authorized a critical flag though I

1507
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,650
think I posed on the table is to take

1508
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:46,680
the range of possible option kinds and

1509
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:47,849
Mark some range as critical and the rest

1510
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,470
the range is critical it might be

1511
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:51,480
half-and-half might be quarter in three

1512
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:54,980
quarters we can even figure that out on

1513
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:59,429
on the list where the semantics of a

1514
01:20:54,980 --> 01:21:03,959
critic of a of an understood critical

1515
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:09,540
option are at least to drop to two to

1516
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:13,770
cease option processing at that point so

1517
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:16,170
I think it's more than that this this

1518
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:18,680
bid is based on what ipv6 did for how

1519
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:22,200
khop options and destination options and

1520
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:23,659
so the two higher order bits in an ipv6

1521
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,209
option type and

1522
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:27,619
disposition of an option that is

1523
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:31,429
undirected an option type that's

1524
01:21:27,619 --> 01:21:32,929
unrecognized by the receiver one of the

1525
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:36,199
these there's two bits because there is

1526
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:38,630
also an ICMP disposition but we don't

1527
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:41,089
need that here so fundamentally ipv6

1528
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:42,860
says you do one of two things if you see

1529
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:45,110
an option you don't recognize you either

1530
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:48,169
skip it and continue processing options

1531
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:50,570
or you drop the packet and the reason

1532
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:52,669
you drop the packet is because if you

1533
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:55,219
don't recognize that option and don't

1534
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:56,869
process it the processing of the rest of

1535
01:21:55,219 --> 01:22:00,679
the packet may be fundamentally

1536
01:21:56,869 --> 01:22:03,018
incorrect and that that's that that last

1537
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:05,269
part is significant because if you don't

1538
01:22:03,019 --> 01:22:07,189
have this fit and you can ignore any

1539
01:22:05,269 --> 01:22:10,099
option that means you can never have

1540
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:14,199
options that are interesting that like

1541
01:22:10,099 --> 01:22:18,550
modify the data you can't modify the UDP

1542
01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:23,178
payload area as in the normal UDP data

1543
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:24,800
according to the spec yes yes there's

1544
01:22:23,179 --> 01:22:28,249
part two of this though there are two

1545
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:30,229
use cases here for UDP options so one is

1546
01:22:28,249 --> 01:22:32,630
where you have a trailer in which case

1547
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:35,059
you have an actual UDP payload in that

1548
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:37,369
case I completely agree however the rule

1549
01:22:35,059 --> 01:22:39,380
is simple if you're in that mode you

1550
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:41,959
can't send any of these sort of options

1551
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:44,419
so if we use this bit approach you

1552
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:47,239
should never see that bit set in any of

1553
01:22:44,419 --> 01:22:49,159
these travel options because it's

1554
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:52,308
invalid because those options consult

1555
01:22:49,159 --> 01:22:56,058
always be ignored but in mode 2 where

1556
01:22:52,309 --> 01:22:59,209
the UDP length is 8 a there's no such

1557
01:22:56,059 --> 01:23:00,889
thing as an agency receiver the legacy

1558
01:22:59,209 --> 01:23:02,539
receivers don't see any payload or

1559
01:23:00,889 --> 01:23:05,419
anything as they essentially adopt the

1560
01:23:02,539 --> 01:23:07,518
passion with the tie with a caveat but

1561
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:09,709
if it's a receiver that processes

1562
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:12,169
options then it can follow the rules

1563
01:23:09,709 --> 01:23:14,289
process the option list if I see an

1564
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:16,999
option I don't understand and it's

1565
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:19,820
important drop it and don't forget in

1566
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:22,880
that case you there is no technical UDP

1567
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:24,829
payload there is payload yes that's in

1568
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,659
the surplus space we can do whatever we

1569
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:28,459
want with that because that's not UDP

1570
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:30,709
payload so we can change it and encrypt

1571
01:23:28,459 --> 01:23:33,559
it or whatever are you advocating that

1572
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:36,829
if there's ever one of these options

1573
01:23:33,559 --> 01:23:37,369
that says it's critical anywhere in the

1574
01:23:36,829 --> 01:23:39,500
way

1575
01:23:37,369 --> 01:23:44,929
then you should drop all the option

1576
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:47,300
processing you should drop a packet so

1577
01:23:44,929 --> 01:23:51,829
we should do a two paths through the

1578
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:55,190
option space well yeah and what's

1579
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:58,610
different here is ipv6 to find that

1580
01:23:55,190 --> 01:24:01,940
option behavior as part of defining ipv6

1581
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:05,329
we're retrofitting here and not

1582
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:08,000
disturbing the behavior of existing UDP

1583
01:24:05,329 --> 01:24:10,250
payload when the payload is present is

1584
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,469
definitely important I'm not sure about

1585
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:14,239
the about the zero and zero links

1586
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:16,130
conventionally UDP okay so I am

1587
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,509
certainly dropping the packet when when

1588
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:19,670
there's really to be payload there

1589
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:21,940
because you have a bad option is is a

1590
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:25,610
problem so we already have one case

1591
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:28,759
where the problem is we can't deliver

1592
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:30,829
data that have not been properly

1593
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:32,869
processed we already see this in the

1594
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:35,299
fragment case we cannot deliver

1595
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:38,000
fragments to the application and pretend

1596
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:40,849
like they're there properly formed

1597
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,010
yes that's correct my proposal is of all

1598
01:24:40,849 --> 01:24:44,750
the fragment data would be sitting in

1599
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:47,449
the options area not in the conventional

1600
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:48,440
EU to be payload area okay so we have to

1601
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:51,019
be really careful

1602
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:54,019
there's UDP payload area which is

1603
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:56,570
covered by UDP length when I say UDP

1604
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:58,940
application we very carefully be when I

1605
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:01,369
say UDP look I mean what is covered by

1606
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:03,110
UDP length the proposal for fragment is

1607
01:25:01,369 --> 01:25:05,329
it when we're doing fragmentation all

1608
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:08,119
the fragment data which could cause

1609
01:25:05,329 --> 01:25:10,009
problems for a conventional receiver if

1610
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:13,009
you sent to a conventional receiver is

1611
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:14,000
sitting in the UDP options area beyond

1612
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:16,429
UDP length

1613
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,980
yes and what I'm saying is there are

1614
01:25:16,429 --> 01:25:21,409
other cases where like fragment where we

1615
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:23,989
cannot deliver that data encrypted data

1616
01:25:21,409 --> 01:25:25,909
will have the same property if we ever

1617
01:25:23,989 --> 01:25:27,799
do compression so there's going to be

1618
01:25:25,909 --> 01:25:29,449
other use cases we can't deliver

1619
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,369
it's gibberish if we deliver an

1620
01:25:29,449 --> 01:25:33,348
agreement okay I'm in agreement and I

1621
01:25:31,369 --> 01:25:36,739
don't I don't see the point so maybe you

1622
01:25:33,349 --> 01:25:38,090
could try to enlist again III agreed

1623
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:50,808
everything you said but I thought it

1624
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:52,790
already was was agreed so let me try to

1625
01:25:50,809 --> 01:25:54,770
capture where I think we can't land it

1626
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:58,400
landed out landed out of that which is

1627
01:25:54,770 --> 01:26:01,610
that in particular if there's if there's

1628
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,769
UDP payload and there's a problem and

1629
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:07,339
options processing eg from an

1630
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:09,619
unrecognized critical option you can

1631
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:13,389
drop the options but you can't drop the

1632
01:26:09,619 --> 01:26:16,670
what is described by UDP length correct

1633
01:26:13,389 --> 01:26:19,760
okay I think there was a the term UDP

1634
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:24,770
payload versus might been an option my

1635
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:27,679
pad in fusing so points 1 and point 2 to

1636
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:30,050
me are extensibility hmm so I think as a

1637
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:33,590
design principle we want to make sure

1638
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:35,840
that we can have version 2 of this

1639
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:38,780
protocol if necessary and we can have

1640
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:41,599
this option case so that's why I

1641
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:45,380
advocate making extensibility of the

1642
01:26:41,599 --> 01:26:49,550
first order issue ok this we should

1643
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:53,420
discussed it on the list channeling mic

1644
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:55,340
heard from jabber the problem is some of

1645
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:57,230
the options affect data handling and in

1646
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:00,260
that case the data and the options must

1647
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:02,388
share fate yes Thomas had all the things

1648
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:08,780
I wanted to say and we also see it in

1649
01:27:02,389 --> 01:27:12,980
the encryption case as well again that's

1650
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:15,290
good let's try and make sure this level

1651
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:16,669
of agreement is actually on the lists by

1652
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:18,889
following that's up on the lists I'm

1653
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:21,199
making sure that whether Joy's on the

1654
01:27:18,889 --> 01:27:23,719
same page let's go to the next one ok

1655
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:26,419
and I think the the other thing is I

1656
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:28,579
believe that the the design direction

1657
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:31,099
going forward for how to put a critical

1658
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:33,259
indication in the option is the divide

1659
01:27:31,099 --> 01:27:35,030
up the option space it might be the most

1660
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:38,329
significant bit of this 50/50 it might

1661
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:40,460
be the two most visits if it's 2575 will

1662
01:27:38,329 --> 01:27:42,139
figure out on the list how divide up but

1663
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:45,020
that's that I believe the design

1664
01:27:42,139 --> 01:27:47,570
direction going forward and I see nobody

1665
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:50,179
headed for the mic so that's our record

1666
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:53,599
that essentially the room so it's

1667
01:27:50,179 --> 01:27:57,110
decided light on frag I needed to be

1668
01:27:53,599 --> 01:28:00,570
sported and I saw the use case mentioned

1669
01:27:57,110 --> 01:28:04,049
on the list of using frag to support DNS

1670
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:06,559
that might be a very useful use case to

1671
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:11,570
trying crystallize so we're going to

1672
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:14,400
follow that one up but do we need light

1673
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:16,950
that is a real question to the working

1674
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:22,049
group do we need the light functionality

1675
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:24,059
independent of frag the discussion that

1676
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:25,560
the chair saw on the list recently

1677
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:27,930
suggested that we might be able to

1678
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:31,860
remove the UDP light partial coverage

1679
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:33,120
function from the option trailer so it

1680
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:38,700
so we don't have an option that says

1681
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:42,470
this is UDP light equivalent and does

1682
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:46,230
anybody think that we need the UDP light

1683
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:49,890
option because if we remove that it will

1684
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:53,419
be simpler and jaws says there seems to

1685
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:55,920
be support for dropping it yeah the the

1686
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:58,740
consequence that the discussion are

1687
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:02,970
about light and wear lighter we've got

1688
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:06,570
connected into all of this was if you're

1689
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:11,030
trying to do DNS fragmentation chrisbeek

1690
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:14,460
because of DNS setting using UDP options

1691
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:16,830
because OCS has to be present in every

1692
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:19,680
single one of those UDP packets you've

1693
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:22,010
got the individual checksum do you

1694
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:25,320
almost immediately assembly checksum and

1695
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:27,720
if you want an end and we assembly

1696
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,929
checksum that shove it in the

1697
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:33,810
application is so there's note this

1698
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:35,480
there's no reason to borrow it and if

1699
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:38,430
the application is doing its own

1700
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:40,349
reassembly checksum that does not remove

1701
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:43,140
the need for OCS because we still need

1702
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:44,790
back to check validity of validity of

1703
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:47,190
the options and make sure that the

1704
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:51,660
packet goes through the paths that need

1705
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:53,070
that OCS compensation to go through that

1706
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:55,680
would seem to be another similar to what

1707
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:58,410
still an IPA level fragmentation anyway

1708
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,910
look Tom Tom Herbert yeah if an

1709
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:01,680
application cares about integrity

1710
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:04,470
they're they're doing much more than a

1711
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:08,010
checksum they'll do some strong CRC or

1712
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:10,050
something even stronger so that's not I

1713
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:11,930
don't think that's very compelling to

1714
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:13,360
say the application to do a checksum

1715
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:14,830
mm-hmm

1716
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,710
so we could provide some weak way of

1717
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:21,580
doing this and we could provide a crc32

1718
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:23,740
option but the basic function doesn't

1719
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:27,550
need it though is that what worries

1720
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:30,690
about think to confirm analysts in

1721
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:34,210
particular what I just said about a

1722
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:36,730
primary focus on does this do something

1723
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:38,980
useful for DNS with large DNS SEC

1724
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:43,089
payloads also will need be criminalist

1725
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:45,730
as a as a as a full way to focus the

1726
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:49,360
design do we want to create a pod an

1727
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:52,959
option okay sorry question channeling

1728
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:56,980
might heard no light option trailer does

1729
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:59,260
bad things to legacy receivers okay what

1730
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:01,540
does bad things to what one legacy

1731
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:07,480
receivers like is you one more voice for

1732
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:10,360
not eating like oh okay Paden has been

1733
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:12,849
proposed on the list as an option does

1734
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:16,170
anyone want to speak about why it's

1735
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:24,000
useful or why it's not useful

1736
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:28,140
Jules comment is easy to add so it is a

1737
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,030
grant it's a relatively minor point but

1738
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:33,280
the the difference here is we want to

1739
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:35,320
model stateful options or stateless

1740
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,000
options and I think if you're going with

1741
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:40,830
stateless option which you seem closer

1742
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:43,120
to I would prefer the ideas ipv6 method

1743
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:45,280
implementation wise if I have both of

1744
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,570
these it's a lot easier because I can

1745
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,519
use the same implementation for

1746
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:51,070
hop-by-hop destination options now

1747
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:53,260
segment routing options it's UDP option

1748
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:55,269
same exact code it would be just

1749
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:57,640
conveniens quick cinchy it's cheap to

1750
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:59,310
add in fritters friendiy if input is

1751
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:02,620
finding useful sure

1752
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:06,880
channeling mic there's already the ACS

1753
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:09,970
option for reassembly checks up yeah

1754
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:13,050
right yes right answer to a previous

1755
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:20,620
question but yes I buy that okay I'm

1756
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:23,170
right do you have next slide believe

1757
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:24,539
let's see we've rest the slides

1758
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:28,869
yeah

1759
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:31,630
all right taking okay so this is design

1760
01:32:28,869 --> 01:32:33,518
goals and Joel's passionate about this

1761
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:36,400
and it doesn't actually help sculpt the

1762
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:38,530
problem so I think it would be worth

1763
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:41,348
people checking on the list whether they

1764
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:43,210
think the list of design goals are still

1765
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:45,190
valid and whether some of them need to

1766
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:47,380
be updated it would help just thinking

1767
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:49,388
about checking the consistency if we

1768
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:51,999
check the design goals section of the

1769
01:32:49,389 --> 01:32:53,619
draft and we're already questioning

1770
01:32:51,999 --> 01:32:55,690
support for partial checks and coverage

1771
01:32:53,619 --> 01:32:57,280
which was one of those design goals so

1772
01:32:55,690 --> 01:33:00,749
please have a look at these because it

1773
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:06,880
would help your work through them next

1774
01:33:00,749 --> 01:33:08,860
this is explaining there's basic rules

1775
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,510
in those design calls that se how you DP

1776
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:12,639
options work I think it's good to have a

1777
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:15,119
strong model of how you think they'll

1778
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:18,519
work so if you're interested in the UDP

1779
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:20,110
options debate or you've talked on any

1780
01:33:18,519 --> 01:33:21,880
of these topics on the list please check

1781
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:23,949
those and find out whether the design

1782
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:27,940
principles are still correct that's

1783
01:33:23,949 --> 01:33:29,558
right I mean that this one is a summary

1784
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:31,178
of the debate we've talked about so it's

1785
01:33:29,559 --> 01:33:32,920
in the slide deck you can look at it

1786
01:33:31,179 --> 01:33:35,469
with shorter time so we probably won't

1787
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:40,480
be talking about this No is there

1788
01:33:35,469 --> 01:33:42,670
another slide or we done this this is

1789
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,348
the last slide did you check your tablet

1790
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,090
make sheep is any other question who

1791
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:48,010
want to quickly ask for now before we

1792
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:49,869
trace feasibly y'all seem to be less

1793
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:51,940
than half an hour we've got I have one

1794
01:33:49,869 --> 01:33:53,739
question that we didn't ask there was

1795
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:57,969
some so on the list we talked about a

1796
01:33:53,739 --> 01:34:00,699
CRC 16 as an integrity check where as I

1797
01:33:57,969 --> 01:34:03,460
thought David that we had previously

1798
01:34:00,699 --> 01:34:06,129
discussed that remind me otherwise that

1799
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:08,800
we should have been a crc32 see was used

1800
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:11,440
for integrity check as per SCTP and I

1801
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,780
scuzzy is that right my general sense I

1802
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:18,070
think in this discussion and from

1803
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:20,860
elsewhere is that if we don't use the

1804
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:23,650
typical internet 16-bit checksum what is

1805
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:26,139
a CRC the right series t to use is CRC

1806
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:29,589
30 is CR see through to see don't waste

1807
01:34:26,139 --> 01:34:31,659
time on CRC 16 and your crc32 see

1808
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:36,659
because it has incredibly good software

1809
01:34:31,659 --> 01:34:36,659
support courtesy of I scuzzy and SCTP

1810
01:34:36,729 --> 01:34:41,959
I'm I think we could have most arrested

1811
01:34:39,649 --> 01:34:44,949
stuff and what we really need to see is

1812
01:34:41,959 --> 01:34:47,510
people check the design principles and

1813
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:48,949
Joe to revise the documents so that we

1814
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:50,479
have a consistent view of all the

1815
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:53,869
comments that be made on the list

1816
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:55,249
recently if you didn't look at it and

1817
01:34:53,869 --> 01:34:57,739
you're interested please look at the

1818
01:34:55,249 --> 01:34:59,559
next revision from Joe because this is

1819
01:34:57,739 --> 01:35:02,030
beginning to settle down which is good

1820
01:34:59,559 --> 01:35:04,909
okay now I'm gonna I'm gonna

1821
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:05,389
unilaterally bash the agenda Jerome you

1822
01:35:04,909 --> 01:35:08,888
here

1823
01:35:05,389 --> 01:35:10,760
okay let's quickly deal with the

1824
01:35:08,889 --> 01:35:14,989
announcement really different let's

1825
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:18,260
quickly deal with the qci and diffserv

1826
01:35:14,989 --> 01:35:21,530
draft so Jerome and Tim who are the

1827
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:25,999
folks who brought us the very useful RFC

1828
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:30,978
on how to map between Wi-Fi QoS and DIF

1829
01:35:25,999 --> 01:35:33,889
circ us went to work on qci for Chrome

1830
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:36,739
mobile networks you saw some comments

1831
01:35:33,889 --> 01:35:38,929
from the 3G from some 3gpp folks on the

1832
01:35:36,739 --> 01:35:41,718
list expressing let's see I would say

1833
01:35:38,929 --> 01:35:48,919
profound reservations there was a

1834
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:53,419
meeting between 3gpp and IETF leadership

1835
01:35:48,919 --> 01:35:55,760
on Monday which included this topic like

1836
01:35:53,419 --> 01:35:57,260
Magnus Magnus go and I were all there

1837
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:00,139
along with I think some other folks in

1838
01:35:57,260 --> 01:36:04,969
the room the upshot of that meeting is

1839
01:36:00,139 --> 01:36:07,489
that we the there will not be a

1840
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:10,459
normative stainless area so this cannot

1841
01:36:07,489 --> 01:36:12,468
be standards track they there appears to

1842
01:36:10,459 --> 01:36:15,829
be an opportunity to write an

1843
01:36:12,469 --> 01:36:19,340
informational draft for guidance to non

1844
01:36:15,829 --> 01:36:21,619
experts eg those setting up private

1845
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:25,340
networks and there will be more details

1846
01:36:21,619 --> 01:36:28,879
coming there is work going on to to

1847
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:31,459
precise to more more precisely record

1848
01:36:28,879 --> 01:36:33,769
the outcome of that meeting in a couple

1849
01:36:31,459 --> 01:36:36,169
of paragraphs when that's all written

1850
01:36:33,769 --> 01:36:37,519
down and agreed to we will we will we

1851
01:36:36,169 --> 01:36:38,898
will forward that to the list that

1852
01:36:37,519 --> 01:36:41,959
everybody understands where we're going

1853
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:42,649
from here interjecting on the previous

1854
01:36:41,959 --> 01:36:45,289
topic

1855
01:36:42,649 --> 01:36:47,209
channeling Mike hurt the CRC 16 was

1856
01:36:45,289 --> 01:36:50,420
agreed on the list some time ago they

1857
01:36:47,209 --> 01:36:55,580
agreed this decision should be revisited

1858
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:57,620
okay thanks Germany thing that jumping

1859
01:36:55,580 --> 01:37:00,710
back on to these topic good morning

1860
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:02,300
Germany one of the others so Thank You

1861
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:06,590
mr. chair I'm looking forward to the

1862
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:10,160
feedback from the summary of what said

1863
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:12,290
and I think if as I hope the feedback is

1864
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:14,480
that they are not opposed to an

1865
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:16,100
informative texts one of the first tests

1866
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:18,290
will probably be to clarify the intent

1867
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:21,320
of that draft in order to express that

1868
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:23,780
we're not you know tending to impose a

1869
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:26,480
map-21 but you know build a sort of a

1870
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:28,219
language translation system so that if

1871
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,440
people have multipath traffic going

1872
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:31,880
through each of these two domains they

1873
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:34,700
have a way to understand what the

1874
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:38,570
expression of intent of one mapping in

1875
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:39,860
one system means into the other so once

1876
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:41,780
we have that if we have that feedback

1877
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,130
and if it's positive I would like to

1878
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,630
come back to this group you know first

1879
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:46,670
of all you know clarify the intent and

1880
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:49,280
get your feedback so that we can build

1881
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:51,920
together a system to see if we can

1882
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:54,490
translate those mappings into one one to

1883
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:57,410
the other especially a 3gpp has built

1884
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:59,090
new definitions of new traffic which I

1885
01:37:57,410 --> 01:38:01,940
think are not entirely clearly

1886
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:11,890
describing our domain primarily in the

1887
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:14,059
world value T thank you ah Martin

1888
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:16,610
probably ought to introduce yourself

1889
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:20,510
with the 3gpp affiliation please

1890
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:23,540
okay so Martin Dali 18 TM herbs and 18 t

1891
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:27,260
and the CT as well as sa three working

1892
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:33,140
groups okay so the table that's being

1893
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:34,700
referenced here on qci in essay 2 is an

1894
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:38,480
informative table and the reason why

1895
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:41,150
it's an informative table is that just

1896
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:43,360
like each of the characters and their

1897
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:45,290
backbones used if surco points

1898
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:48,440
differently

1899
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:52,790
the qci and arc which is the priority

1900
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:56,210
marking are also used differently or can

1901
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:59,230
be used differently between various

1902
01:38:56,210 --> 01:39:01,510
different carriers in addition

1903
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:03,259
particularly as we're moving forward in

1904
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:07,390
further defining

1905
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:11,180
gee that table is ever-changing and so

1906
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:16,180
one it's a moving target and two it's

1907
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:18,470
informative so any kind of must language

1908
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:22,100
referring to an informative table is

1909
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:25,070
probably ill-advised as well as it the

1910
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:29,900
fact that it's a moving target in

1911
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:33,139
addition the guidance I believe will be

1912
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:36,200
most useful I think in five G for

1913
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:38,600
Private Network deployments but I don't

1914
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:42,580
think it would be necessarily useful at

1915
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:44,810
all for carriers who already know how to

1916
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:47,690
provision their networks thank let's

1917
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:49,580
know yeah yeah I think we're basically I

1918
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:52,370
think we're basically done here let's

1919
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:55,250
let's let's get the text when the text

1920
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:58,730
comes out we'll see a manatee

1921
01:39:55,250 --> 01:40:01,850
we've got across all the comments it is

1922
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:03,530
potentially useful for private for for

1923
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:06,560
for private networks that's at least a

1924
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:10,130
good starting point just a word fully

1925
01:40:06,560 --> 01:41:03,790
agree thank you I think we're expecting

1926
01:40:10,130 --> 01:41:06,050
here is which is clear because we we

1927
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:08,750
hopefully we will try and take this

1928
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:10,970
check Greg's presentation quickly okay

1929
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:12,710
and because we we post it last night yet

1930
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:14,600
and it wasn't a doc it was a draft up

1931
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:17,300
for adoption and we will try and leave

1932
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:21,260
enough time to give you some time

1933
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:27,980
which is yeah okay we'll do it is truly

1934
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:30,560
right yeah I cannot take it to break can

1935
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:34,580
you try to get through the slides in

1936
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:37,880
well under 10 minutes okay all right

1937
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:40,670
pretty wide with Caleb's and for this

1938
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:42,860
version of the draft I was joined by a

1939
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:58,780
co-author or Thomas Masotti who's I

1940
01:41:42,860 --> 01:42:01,960
believe joining us remotely so right so

1941
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:04,490
presented this draft at last ITF and

1942
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:08,540
just really reiterate what the goals are

1943
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:13,400
of this proposed and non Q building and

1944
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:16,250
QB PhD in code point the idea is to

1945
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:20,540
provide low latency and low loss for

1946
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:23,750
sparse traffic books and that the code

1947
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:25,550
point describes not the ones and needs

1948
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:28,730
of the application or some value

1949
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:31,520
judgment as to its importance relative

1950
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:34,490
to other traffic but instead is is

1951
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,890
conveying verifiable behavior of the

1952
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:39,469
application that it is sparse and and

1953
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:41,980
doesn't build queues in the network and

1954
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:47,000
thus there's no incentive to miss mark

1955
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:48,740
packets that flows that our queue

1956
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,820
building would get Jerry better

1957
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:51,710
performance that they don't mark

1958
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:54,950
themselves as non queue building and

1959
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:57,800
vice versa so applicability here and

1960
01:42:54,950 --> 01:43:02,059
exit the driving instead of used cases

1961
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:03,520
that led to the proposal is in a dual q

1962
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:06,740
l4 s link where you've got

1963
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:09,290
differentiation between effectively

1964
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:12,080
classic TCP in the in the classic Q

1965
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:13,940
versus next-generation TCP is with

1966
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:16,490
congestion controllers that can achieve

1967
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:19,250
ultra low queuing delay in a low latency

1968
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:22,730
queue identifying sparse traffic that

1969
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:25,250
can coexist with that l4s traffic in

1970
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:29,030
that little 8zq but in addition there

1971
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:30,829
are like the other link types that can

1972
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:36,199
make use of this code

1973
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:39,049
and provide similar support for sparse

1974
01:43:36,199 --> 01:43:42,228
traffic in particular pointing up links

1975
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:45,229
that have the ability to optimize media

1976
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:49,429
access or channel parameters for sparse

1977
01:43:45,229 --> 01:43:51,559
traffic the draft in the previous

1978
01:43:49,429 --> 01:43:54,469
version focused mainly on the the DOCSIS

1979
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:55,399
link for cable broadband mentioned Wi-Fi

1980
01:43:54,469 --> 01:43:57,469
a bit

1981
01:43:55,399 --> 01:43:59,689
this version splits out threes to say

1982
01:43:57,469 --> 01:44:01,369
the use cases doctors big one Wi-Fi

1983
01:43:59,689 --> 01:44:07,839
again big one and then adds a section on

1984
01:44:01,369 --> 01:44:11,898
LTE and will include 5g in the next Rev

1985
01:44:07,839 --> 01:44:14,419
so the main updates between the last

1986
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:17,149
draft and this draft as I mentioned

1987
01:44:14,419 --> 01:44:18,648
these listed use-cases section but

1988
01:44:17,149 --> 01:44:21,739
probably the bigger one really is

1989
01:44:18,649 --> 01:44:28,599
merging in this Lola concept which was

1990
01:44:21,739 --> 01:44:31,070
developed for LTE and was the main

1991
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:36,530
aspect that my co-author was involved in

1992
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:38,089
and so Lola the concept Lola was that an

1993
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:40,129
application could make its decision

1994
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:42,379
between whether it wants a little

1995
01:44:40,129 --> 01:44:47,869
latency or whether it wants a little

1996
01:44:42,379 --> 01:44:51,800
loss and that concept I guess morphed

1997
01:44:47,869 --> 01:44:55,129
into essentially utilizing or proposing

1998
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:57,699
to utilize the same signaling as we

1999
01:44:55,129 --> 01:45:02,679
proposed in the nqb draft originally and

2000
01:44:57,699 --> 01:45:05,898
with further discussion we agreed that

2001
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:09,409
the definition of nqv is like

2002
01:45:05,899 --> 01:45:11,989
identifying sparse traffic and providing

2003
01:45:09,409 --> 01:45:13,999
both low latency and low loss was it was

2004
01:45:11,989 --> 01:45:18,978
a better outcome in the end and so that

2005
01:45:13,999 --> 01:45:22,760
work was merged into the MQB draft other

2006
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:28,070
changes additions in the comparison to

2007
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:29,949
existing approaches section mention the

2008
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:33,889
previous little approach also

2009
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:36,829
referencing an RD mechanism rate delay

2010
01:45:33,889 --> 01:45:40,059
trade-off mechanism that was some

2011
01:45:36,829 --> 01:45:43,429
earlier work as well that discuss and

2012
01:45:40,059 --> 01:45:44,630
then there was a comment at the last

2013
01:45:43,429 --> 01:45:47,780
IETF

2014
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:51,850
should discussed the implications on the

2015
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:55,880
RFC 83 25 mapping of diffserv to 802 11

2016
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:59,330
and so we've got a recommendation there

2017
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:06,590
as well okay the rest of these slides

2018
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:10,550
are essentially a essentially a review

2019
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:13,330
of the slides that I presented last ITF

2020
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:22,040
so I think the interest of time I'll

2021
01:46:13,330 --> 01:46:24,469
skip through those quick note on this

2022
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:27,489
one the most important word in this

2023
01:46:24,469 --> 01:46:30,770
sighs proposal please don't put this

2024
01:46:27,489 --> 01:46:32,799
dscp into running code please don't do

2025
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:32,800
that

2026
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:43,820
yeah it's Burnett all right

2027
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:46,489
becomes that I've seen them both on the

2028
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:50,000
mailing list and offline so talk when

2029
01:46:46,489 --> 01:46:51,799
adding five G nomenclature in the mobile

2030
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,270
section so there's been some discussion

2031
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:57,590
on that and what's the appropriate

2032
01:46:53,270 --> 01:47:01,639
language their comment about you know

2033
01:46:57,590 --> 01:47:03,170
interesting mobile networks the the fact

2034
01:47:01,639 --> 01:47:06,880
that mobile networks have highly varying

2035
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:09,560
channel capacity is a aspect that maybe

2036
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,630
the original use cases didn't have to

2037
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:15,260
consider for for example for cable

2038
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:18,980
broadband and so some interest in

2039
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:20,510
running lab tests to understand the cue

2040
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:24,049
death and queue protection implications

2041
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:26,210
for someone that works and then offline

2042
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:28,550
there's a discussion in relates to the

2043
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:31,550
the immediately previous in a previous

2044
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:35,270
discussion around QC I and diffserv map

2045
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:38,690
mapping we have a line in the n cubed

2046
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:40,880
graph that says for LTE you must use a

2047
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:42,650
low latency bear with QC i7 and the

2048
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,020
suggestion was let's that's not the

2049
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:46,730
normative on that at least on the QC I

2050
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:50,960
piece of it and say must use a low

2051
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:54,489
latency bear EG with QC i7 and martin

2052
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:54,489
Dali thank you for your help with this

2053
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,140
and then a number of folks have chimed

2054
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:03,449
in on the mailing list expressing

2055
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:04,800
they're interested in this draft and

2056
01:48:03,449 --> 01:48:15,210
utilized and functionality that it

2057
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:18,810
defines and I think with that she with

2058
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:21,420
us thanks for this job I have actually

2059
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:24,870
and also thanks birth you know softening

2060
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:27,600
that language must say but I actually

2061
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:30,890
read the draft and I see that for Wi-Fi

2062
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:35,340
sections you had recommendation should

2063
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:36,840
but or the LT section you had must so is

2064
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:40,020
there any Pacific reason for that

2065
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:42,210
because I would prefer I think that even

2066
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:45,210
this should be should not the mosque

2067
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:48,179
because as Martin said that in its

2068
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:50,670
evolving and not pacifically even giving

2069
01:48:48,179 --> 01:48:53,790
the example because I think Wi-Fi

2070
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:55,830
section I like that section so if this

2071
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:58,820
section can be mastered the similar tone

2072
01:48:55,830 --> 01:49:00,989
I think that would be better

2073
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:02,519
probably the reason for the difference

2074
01:49:00,989 --> 01:49:09,030
we must ensure it actually comes from

2075
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:13,350
which of the two co-authors I thought

2076
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:15,210
that you know that yeah I don't think

2077
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:18,360
there would be any maybe concern on

2078
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:19,980
speaking have my co-author but yeah and

2079
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:21,269
should this go ahead this is obviously

2080
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:24,709
something that the working group would

2081
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:29,730
have to decide on yes

2082
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:33,810
likewise I observed the in the draft you

2083
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:38,280
have a should requirement for protection

2084
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:40,739
against miss marked flows my observation

2085
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:43,199
is that an implementation that doesn't

2086
01:49:40,739 --> 01:49:46,468
implement that should is in a very sorry

2087
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:48,210
state indeed and if you assume that the

2088
01:49:46,469 --> 01:49:50,550
implementation can automatically

2089
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:52,679
classify flows into non Q building and Q

2090
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:57,120
building close or why did we need a DSP

2091
01:49:52,679 --> 01:49:59,489
to start with so the first part actually

2092
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:01,110
the suggestion that that be a Mazda

2093
01:49:59,489 --> 01:50:03,330
support Q protection was mentioned on

2094
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:05,070
the last ITF as well the reason that I

2095
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:09,660
left that as a should is I think that

2096
01:50:05,070 --> 01:50:11,670
there are some computers uplands that

2097
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:14,130
would not need to implement your

2098
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:15,840
protection in particular an FQ system or

2099
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:20,460
there's isolation per flow maybe without

2100
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:22,800
much finance yeah so it's just maybe we

2101
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:27,270
need more text to give examples of what

2102
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:29,280
why it's regular wages yeah so with the

2103
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:31,830
second I think one additional points I

2104
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:35,009
read the security consideration I think

2105
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:37,170
it's a good thing but maybe that's a

2106
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:39,600
little bit elaboration would be good who

2107
01:50:37,170 --> 01:50:40,800
is responsible for marking this you

2108
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:43,500
mention about that no integrity

2109
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:45,480
protections in on path attacker can

2110
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:47,400
change it adding some what the

2111
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:49,379
consequences would be if someone does

2112
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:52,620
that I think that would be a good thing

2113
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:53,390
not to add in that section as well okay

2114
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:56,790
fair enough

2115
01:50:53,390 --> 01:51:03,000
so my next question to the working group

2116
01:50:56,790 --> 01:51:08,030
is who has read this document so hard

2117
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:08,030
like a show of hands oh I need to count

2118
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:18,780
yeah maybe tot 15 so that's good of the

2119
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:20,340
people who've read it or maybe in

2120
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:22,920
general no and generally the working

2121
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:25,710
group then I'm can we have a hunt for

2122
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:27,630
people who think that this topic is a

2123
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:29,580
topic that might be worth further study

2124
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:31,650
without reflection on this particular

2125
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:34,980
draft I'm just asking on the topic so

2126
01:51:31,650 --> 01:51:37,559
please hum or if you think this is a

2127
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:39,419
topic that this working group could

2128
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:40,800
usefully do work on and then I'm going

2129
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:43,260
to ask for a second home for people who

2130
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:45,420
think we shouldn't work on it so first

2131
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:47,670
please hum if you think this is a topic

2132
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:54,330
that this working group should explore

2133
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:57,120
and do welcome please home now thank you

2134
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:58,920
please hum if you think this is a topic

2135
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:59,699
that this working group should not do

2136
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:07,699
work upon

2137
01:51:59,699 --> 01:52:07,699
please hunt now that was very helpful

2138
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:15,210
there was were the recording strong

2139
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:19,350
strong strong strong hum in favors no

2140
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:21,800
sent silence against unforgeable hum in

2141
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:24,809
favor thank you

2142
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:29,610
that's useful feedback and you've asked

2143
01:52:24,809 --> 01:52:33,800
for working group adoption and what do

2144
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:33,799
the chest think at this moment should we

2145
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:45,030
think please hum if you think this is an

2146
01:52:43,139 --> 01:52:53,099
item that this working group should

2147
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:55,320
adopt please hum no please hum if you

2148
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:57,269
are in doubt that this is an item that

2149
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,739
this working group should adopt if you

2150
01:52:57,269 --> 01:53:04,499
think there is some reason we should not

2151
01:52:58,739 --> 01:53:06,598
please hum no please come to the mic if

2152
01:53:04,499 --> 01:53:14,190
you have any comments on what we just

2153
01:53:06,599 --> 01:53:21,090
discussed and our ad will follow the end

2154
01:53:14,190 --> 01:53:23,308
of the queue that's forming yeah yeah I

2155
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:26,059
mean that seems very clear that we can

2156
01:53:23,309 --> 01:53:30,690
adopt this sheriff I have the shares

2157
01:53:26,059 --> 01:53:33,090
need to write up and work item yes the

2158
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:35,039
chest will also I'm asked on the list to

2159
01:53:33,090 --> 01:53:36,539
confirm that anybody here and it's an

2160
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:38,759
agreement with the sense of the room we

2161
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:40,860
had see so we see a sense of the room

2162
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:42,719
I'm supporting this thank you for the

2163
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:45,150
presentation we will confirm on the list

2164
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:48,989
and then we work with our ad to decide

2165
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:51,179
what to do yeah okay we would like to

2166
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:53,098
provide some time for a presentation

2167
01:53:51,179 --> 01:53:55,050
weights being squeezed a little bit and

2168
01:53:53,099 --> 01:53:58,079
it probably has a lot of slides so and

2169
01:53:55,050 --> 01:53:59,579
please use the time after you see fit

2170
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:01,499
tell us a bit about who are some young

2171
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:09,478
models absolutely and why you're here

2172
01:54:01,499 --> 01:54:11,070
first of all so if you but still tell us

2173
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:13,679
why you're here and who you are okay

2174
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:18,058
yeah absolutely so my name is Aston

2175
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:20,309
Chaudhary and we had been working on us

2176
01:54:18,059 --> 01:54:23,099
yang models so to give you a little

2177
01:54:20,309 --> 01:54:24,809
background on this particular this

2178
01:54:23,099 --> 01:54:28,099
particular draft was part of the net one

2179
01:54:24,809 --> 01:54:30,570
working group and there we realized that

2180
01:54:28,099 --> 01:54:33,719
it took a little more analysis from the

2181
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:34,650
QA side also a little more understanding

2182
01:54:33,719 --> 01:54:36,360
on the Yang's

2183
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:39,570
so this particular draft was moved into

2184
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:42,900
a rocking working group from networking

2185
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:46,320
group 0-7 version of the draft

2186
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:47,820
we had adoption call on this one and one

2187
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:51,269
of the comment which came out of that

2188
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:53,370
was why not we present the same TSP

2189
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:56,670
working group take additional comment

2190
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:59,099
from the community as well as for more

2191
01:54:56,670 --> 01:55:02,580
the qsr work in this community so that

2192
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:05,610
was the idea to present it here and get

2193
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:09,650
some additional comment on that so I'm

2194
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:09,650
going to cover this topic very quickly

2195
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:20,850
okay so next one so I already explained

2196
01:55:19,530 --> 01:55:27,480
that fun maybe we can go to the next

2197
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:31,650
slide okay so to come up with a model

2198
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:32,790
which is common across vendors is very

2199
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:36,210
challenging task

2200
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:39,179
the reason being all the vendors are

2201
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:42,300
there so many qsr construct across

2202
01:55:39,179 --> 01:55:45,900
industry that to fit one particular

2203
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:50,550
construct for Albany is very very

2204
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:52,920
difficult so but we realize that there

2205
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:55,949
are a lot of commonalities the lot of

2206
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:59,909
commonalities on the qsr parameter as

2207
01:55:55,949 --> 01:56:03,360
well as the way vendor apply the qsr

2208
01:55:59,909 --> 01:56:06,809
configuration on the devices and so what

2209
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:10,440
we realize that typically all vendors

2210
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:12,600
create a qsr policy and apply on

2211
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:17,099
interfaces in ingress and egress

2212
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:19,889
direction so by understanding that we

2213
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:22,770
came up with this model where we

2214
01:56:19,889 --> 01:56:26,280
converted the model into t3 set of

2215
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:30,989
layers one was the base layer which

2216
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:33,239
consists of classifier action policy and

2217
01:56:30,989 --> 01:56:37,199
target so the classifier is nothing but

2218
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:39,509
a set of filters and policies list of

2219
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:42,030
classifier associated with the

2220
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:44,550
corresponding actions so now in the

2221
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:46,639
policy you know we can have a classifier

2222
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:48,210
which could be referred or it could be

2223
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:51,330
in line

2224
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:53,760
configuration of the Matis so we created

2225
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:57,300
this base model and then we created a

2226
01:56:53,760 --> 01:57:00,390
derived model which consists of DIF sir

2227
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:06,719
model queuing policy and schedule and

2228
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:09,210
policy these derive models took the base

2229
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:12,870
element stitch it together to create

2230
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:15,420
this policy and this you know despite

2231
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:17,940
all this it is possible that a vendor

2232
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:20,730
has its own set of requirements for its

2233
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:22,650
own set of features so which can be done

2234
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:29,639
by vendor specific augmentation to the

2235
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:31,410
model so ie as I already explained there

2236
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:33,050
is a class per module which is referred

2237
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:35,370
by the name contains the list of filters

2238
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:37,469
there is a policy module which contains

2239
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:40,320
set of classifier with the corresponding

2240
01:57:37,469 --> 01:57:44,400
actions the classifier could be referred

2241
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:50,190
by reference or it could be a filter

2242
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:52,230
parameter which is here in line this is

2243
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:56,269
a typical Yankee diagram where you can

2244
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:59,070
see that classifier list of filters

2245
01:57:56,270 --> 01:58:01,050
similarly this is a Yankee diagram which

2246
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:03,090
contains a list of classifier for the

2247
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:04,620
corresponding actions you can see that

2248
01:58:03,090 --> 01:58:09,090
the classifier can be defined in line or

2249
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:11,370
reference now this is action module

2250
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:14,430
where which contain metering mark

2251
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:16,380
including scheduling actions the burn

2252
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:18,140
rate to color one at three color and to

2253
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:20,790
rate three color is taken from

2254
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:24,030
previously define RFC two six nine seven

2255
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:26,280
two six nine eight some of the queuing

2256
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:30,950
and scheduling parameter have been taken

2257
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:33,780
from RFC three two eight nine next I

2258
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:36,239
think I already explained all these

2259
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:38,309
except that the gives a model content of

2260
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:41,429
circulatory parameters which is five

2261
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:43,320
tuple as well as the DHCP value in

2262
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:45,180
addition to that we can define kulick

2263
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:50,309
queuing and scheduling parameter in line

2264
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:53,340
to the policy one very small knit or you

2265
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:55,520
can't use ranges with DSC pays usual

2266
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,520
list

2267
01:58:56,510 --> 01:59:01,530
DSC PS are not paying a set of uniform

2268
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:06,360
things so you can't use a

2269
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:09,330
you must use a list of gscp okay so if

2270
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:16,380
you watch one was arranged expand the

2271
01:59:09,330 --> 01:59:18,570
range list vscp okay okay now that is

2272
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:21,050
how difficult it is finally configuring

2273
01:59:18,570 --> 01:59:21,049
to the devices

2274
01:59:21,470 --> 01:59:27,450
okay so doing policy will contain

2275
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:29,010
including related parameters and we can

2276
01:59:27,450 --> 01:59:32,280
always have four three two eight nine

2277
01:59:29,010 --> 01:59:35,060
for those parameters scheduling policy

2278
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:40,889
will contain a queuing policy as well as

2279
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:42,420
min rate next state at that time you

2280
01:59:40,890 --> 01:59:44,070
have means olive and I have their own

2281
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:46,500
set of features which can be easy

2282
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:48,240
augmenting augmented to the model and

2283
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:52,350
they can enhance the model the way they

2284
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:55,320
want so in summary you know we have

2285
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:57,330
defined a base set of modules and then

2286
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:59,370
we have based on those face set of

2287
01:59:57,330 --> 02:00:00,360
modules we have three actually derived

2288
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:02,640
set of modules

2289
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:04,620
it is pretty more adaptable to any

2290
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:07,440
vendor requirements it could be

2291
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:10,019
augmented to any specific vendor

2292
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:14,509
specific parameters and you know it can

2293
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:17,040
it is pretty very extensible next thing

2294
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:18,930
yeah please go through the draft when

2295
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:22,830
you get time and please provide some

2296
02:00:18,930 --> 02:00:24,900
comments thank you can I ask people to

2297
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:27,300
come to the mic if they have comments

2298
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:31,110
and also to think because I'm just about

2299
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:33,540
to ask whether anyone in this room can

2300
02:00:31,110 --> 02:00:35,670
help in this initiative because this

2301
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:37,790
room has expertise in running networks

2302
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:41,280
with QoS and has the expertise and if so

2303
02:00:37,790 --> 02:00:47,370
is there anybody here who is willing to

2304
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:49,050
help well please use the list to ask as

2305
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:51,150
well because I'm I think that with a

2306
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:52,710
little bit of an encouragement we should

2307
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:54,509
be able to find some people to help read

2308
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:58,610
this yes so if you have a couple of

2309
02:00:54,510 --> 02:00:58,610
minutes I can cover the others later

2310
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:07,650
thank you is this up for adoption Ricky

2311
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:11,700
yeah absolutely means this is candidate

2312
02:01:07,650 --> 02:01:13,200
for adoption and this is we already went

2313
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:15,090
through one adoption call we got

2314
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:17,429
comments be incorporated those

2315
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:20,190
so it is pretty much on that line okay

2316
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:21,330
that's good that's like my impression

2317
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:27,990
was I think I think it's been enough

2318
02:01:21,330 --> 02:01:29,850
bye-bye by RT gwg okay yeah so one thing

2319
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:34,110
I would like to explain here as part of

2320
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:36,240
this presentation is that we created a

2321
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:39,000
separate operational model

2322
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:41,460
the reason being config model was too

2323
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,890
detailed an operation model requires own

2324
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:47,820
set of analysis on the counters part and

2325
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:50,640
so we went through all the different

2326
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:53,130
discussions we thought is very it's

2327
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:56,480
better idea to have a separate model for

2328
02:01:53,130 --> 02:02:00,450
operation and where we can detail about

2329
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:02,639
the statistics for qsr one other thing

2330
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:05,849
is that you know nowadays this lot of

2331
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:08,520
talk about network visibility so the way

2332
02:02:05,850 --> 02:02:12,120
we present the counters to the providers

2333
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:14,730
is very very important and so for

2334
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:16,500
network visibility how we present has to

2335
02:02:14,730 --> 02:02:19,190
be thoroughly discussed which has been

2336
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:21,900
done in this particular draft

2337
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:24,360
so essentially you know these are the

2338
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:26,700
basic element for any Q s policy which

2339
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:30,530
can be applied to interface we have

2340
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:33,120
class per classifier statistics we have

2341
02:02:30,530 --> 02:02:35,550
policy statistics B metering and queuing

2342
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:37,740
statistics in addition to that we have

2343
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:40,320
named statistics which is very similar

2344
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:42,630
to classical statistics except that it

2345
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:45,210
has a common name across the classifier

2346
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:47,580
when it does happen that means we

2347
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:49,440
aggregate those counters this is very

2348
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:52,680
very beneficial for low-end devices

2349
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:57,480
where the resources for hardware is very

2350
02:02:52,680 --> 02:03:00,270
scarce so other than that yeah it's a

2351
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:02,969
usual stuff we have meeting statistics

2352
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:08,910
for all the different kind of poly cell

2353
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:14,150
and we have stats for confirmed by its

2354
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:14,150
confirm rate and violate exceed actions

2355
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:19,320
similarly we have queueing stats which

2356
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:21,600
is regarding the queue what is the

2357
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:23,610
length of the queue how many packets per

2358
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:28,010
drop through it how many packets are

2359
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:29,990
there in the queue and pretty much there

2360
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:32,240
so if you get time please go through the

2361
02:03:29,990 --> 02:03:35,450
come on the draft and please for

2362
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:37,580
documents thank you forever so much for

2363
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:39,650
making that so short and if you have

2364
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:42,140
questions please speak to the gentlemen

2365
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:44,030
action and please use the list to

2366
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:47,120
discuss I think we need to conclude that

2367
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:48,650
this meetings over for today please come

2368
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:50,690
back tomorrow where we'll have the other

2369
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:56,960
items on our schedule

2370
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:58,219
thank you have a good lunch for anyone

2371
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,400
who hasn't signed the blue sheets or up

2372
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:00,400
here

2373
