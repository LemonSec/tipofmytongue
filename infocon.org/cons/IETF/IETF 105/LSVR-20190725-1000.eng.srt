we get going

4
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:14,030
we're looking for a jabber scribe if

5
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:19,940
someone would be so kind as to do that

6
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:26,100
look for some volunteers around the room

7
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:27,870
you'll need this to get going you go

8
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,030
we'll take care of the notes so that's

9
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,530
you want to freak out about that but

10
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:39,420
we're still looking for someone who can

11
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:42,500
help us with jabber one once nobody

12
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,500
wants to do any jabbering

13
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,390
oh all right we'll figure it out I'm

14
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,610
gonna do it all right I'll do it

15

16
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,480
let's get going

17
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,260
thank you very much for coming to ITF in

18
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,579
five the LSP our working group co-chairs

19
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,140
will under the weather so I'm gonna try

20
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,510
to do most of the talking yep and put up

21
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:15,059
with me please note the note well

22
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,859
applies to the meeting you haven't read

23
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,970
it these read it's here is our agenda

24
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,040
we'll take a moment to have a quick look

25
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,570
at that if anyone feels it's out of

26
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,329
order or you want to make a comment now

27
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,359
it's time to do so I have a mic but if

28
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,180
not we will do a some administrator to

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,080
get things going the chair side there'll

30
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:41,280
be a call to action quick presentation

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,550
from Ignis Rab then there will be a few

32
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,120
presentations on some in-flight working

33
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,560
group documents or yet to be working

34
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,980
group documents and then we'll have some

35
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,260
closing comments and next steps all

36
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,750
right

37
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,970
no one at the mic will keep going so we

38
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,890
had a number of key milestones that we

39
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:09,120
had to work through over the last little

40
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:12,750
while as of March 2019 earlier this year

41
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,750
with the applicability statement of LSB

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,750
our DC's adopted it was the LSP

43
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,850
distribution using B to transport that

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,770
was adopted we had the LSP our with

45
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,950
standard Dykstra path selection adopted

46
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,890
those key milestones were were met who

47
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,979
were making good progress on that we had

48
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,620
wanted to get the gang specification for

49
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,270
LSB are going there's still some work to

50
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,310
be done there and that will be addressed

51
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,560
from some of the comments from Agnes on

52
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,950
to sort out well how we move on from

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,950
there and then we'll have a discussion

54
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,800
around the l3 BL which was previously

55
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:54,370
known as Ellis OE adopted as a work

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,330
group ID now a bit of a late adoption

57
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,550
from from a working group status

58
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,130
perspective like I mentioned a moment

59
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,190
ago we seem to be doing doing reasonably

60
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,750
well from a progress perspective we had

61
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,520
some aggressive timelines from the

62
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,360
outset we had want to make rapid

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,960
progress given the state of things there

64
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,550
is an LS we Python 3 demo available so

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,539
effectively an application people can

66
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:23,870
play with and utilize the link it's

67
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:29,030
there over in a github free to use and

68
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:31,430
to play they said an LS BR has made good

69
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,320
progress as a main spec as well and

70
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,080
we'll get an update on that within this

71
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,570
working with some documents that appear

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,520
to be ready for work last call was the

73
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,340
applicability statement document and the

74
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,219
BGP SDF document we had talked about

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,109
this back in March what we'll do is

76
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,150
we'll be a little more aggressive after

77
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,419
this meeting to make sure we get the

78
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,179
reviews in and get the number of

79
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,190
reviewers identified and follow up with

80
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,350
those reviewers so we can get we can get

81
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,210
kind of a good long pass of those

82
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,320
documents make sure they're a literate

83
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,479
state where we can actually move them

84
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,580
forward so that you should expect that

85
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,580
on the list after this meeting

86
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:20,080
and that draws close our introductory

87
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,969
slide set so there's no other comments

88
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,789
we are going to get ready then for I

89
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:30,440
believe it's agnostic next this will be

90
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,860
he'll talk to us about Yang and his

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,860
fields

92
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:51,020
oh yeah sorry my bad it's from the

93
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,020
office area I'm sorry

94
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,729
Oh

95
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:43,090
a selenium Cisco Systems now given that

96
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:46,990
this BG pls we're using a very small

97
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:51,550
subset of it for SPF you know given the

98
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,790
whole universe of it so how much we put

99
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:58,680
into the initial that's a question you

100
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:03,010
know doing it all doing doing both bgp

101
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:07,660
LS SPF family and the regular standard

102
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,520
bgp LS would address family would be

103
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,170
good but you know they're gonna just

104
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,390
definitely share some TVs and things but

105
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,310
the amount of amount of work is a lot

106
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:22,319
different I'm just making that point so

107
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:26,260
that's gonna have to be a decision okay

108
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,750
I'm not disagreeing with that but then

109
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,990
again this is for you as a working group

110
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,150
who owns LS VR to decide what needs to

111
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,250
get configured in order to get that use

112
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,020
and not only configured basically what

113
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,870
state in figures pose and so on that

114
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,460
would indicate we do the we do enough to

115
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,980
configure it and from an operational

116
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,690
standpoint we'd set up a framework and

117
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,060
do what we need for LS be our first

118
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,190
exactly and that's that's a whole point

119
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,229
that the description of the

120
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,110
configuration logic should be the the

121
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:58,950
focus not the encode but basically the

122
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,950
logic how you use that

123
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:06,160
so Kate Patel arcus I was simply going

124
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,750
to ask you to clarify a little more but

125
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,439
before I do that let me give you a

126
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:16,180
status I I'm gonna present the status on

127
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,960
LS fear we have device based model very

128
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:23,920
well hashed out mind you that as a she

129
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:27,850
said the encoding in LS we are follows

130
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,280
the formats of LS address family however

131
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,550
there isn't a model defined for Ellis

132
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,530
address family in idea itself the base

133
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,650
bgp model doesn't cover it and it's not

134
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:40,839
intended to and as part of doing this

135
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,680
work we are also going to come out with

136
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,790
a yang model

137
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,930
or idea for LS ettus family as well

138
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,939
because it applies here and we have done

139
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,649
the work here right so I'm going to talk

140
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,120
a little bit more in my presentation but

141
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:57,040
I thought I just let you know the device

142
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,890
model is ready okay didn't allow liquor

143
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,589
Cisco so I completely agree with Jo and

144
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,620
at least the configuration model will be

145
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:09,220
different but the operational model or

146
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:12,339
the view I think we can share and

147
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,120
leverage that for the LS address family

148
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,670
in general for bt pls so that's

149
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,740
understandable but again from my view I

150
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,479
would say that address family is

151
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,880
probably a small fragment in the whole

152
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,080
scheme of things yes that is needed but

153
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:33,520
that's not necessary say the large

154
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,080
portion of a problem space here pretty

155
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,910
large I think you're referring to the

156
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:46,260
Circe system model or a schema services

157
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:49,630
based model which only is the box base

158
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,640
schema or or the device model itself is

159
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,680
that what you are referring to in this

160
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,779
case I don't particularly distinguish

161
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,270
the two the element model on a service

162
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:01,920
model is what needs to be covered how do

163
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,920
you cover well this is for you to decide

164
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,770
well that's that's basically what they

165
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:15,660
have from my site any other comments and

166
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:15,660
your questions not well thank you

167
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,689
yeah sorry we're have someone work on

168
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:57,449
the mic so we're gonna keep passing some

169
00:12:21,690 --> 00:13:02,940
back and forth let's say testing okay so

170
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:06,770
the next item in our agenda is at the l3

171
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:10,050
DL update so Bren was on a limit so Rob

172
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:17,819
is hot standby to review this draft with

173
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:19,859
us good morning you will have noticed

174
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,200
that I am NOT Randy Bush in spite of the

175
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:30,390
fact that I have magenta Comic Sans so

176
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:33,810
sorry okay so remember the basic point

177
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,880
of the entire l3 dr and i'm probably

178
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,780
gonna say LSO we half a dozen times gun

179
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,110
still getting used to the name change

180
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,699
but remember the goal this is we're

181
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,530
trying to discover the topology and

182
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,090
liveness you know a lot of this is about

183
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,709
just detecting when cables are miss

184
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,880
plugged and the topology isn't what we

185
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,480
expected that kind of thing

186
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,340
and this is from bgp SPF right that's

187
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
the point of all this mechanism and

188
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,320
we're trying to keep it as simple as we

189
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
possibly can

190
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,190
there's some entertaining discussions

191
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,880
within the author's team about how

192
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,710
simple that is Randy and I tend to be if

193
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,330
it's more complicated than a spoon it's

194
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,330
too complicated Kira likes a little bit

195
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,700
more than that but we're having fun

196
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,280
so again reminder of how the stack looks

197
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,920
okay you've got Ethernet frames which

198
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,270
the PD use for this protocol and we're

199
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,709
doing that link checks with the a fuse

200
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:26,310
and Saffy's and then we're feeding stuff

201
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:28,529
up to bgp SPF okay this isn't a routing

202
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,119
protocol we're just

203
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,339
trying to discover the layer 3 addresses

204
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,019
on a point-to-point link in most cases

205
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,759
the art these are in fact point-to-point

206
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:41,730
links ok so what's new since the last

207
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,970
draft sorry not since last Drive since

208
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:50,069
the last meeting what's new in the draft

209
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:51,389
ok so we have this little transport

210
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:55,889
protocol that's built in here it's very

211
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:58,230
very small and it can handle to the 32

212
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,420
octet PDUs we tried to make it clear

213
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,490
which bit is which so there's the

214
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,259
transport layer and there's the PDUs

215
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,749
layered on top of that and we try to

216
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,209
have a clear delineation between that

217
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:11,910
the exact number here to 224th datagrams

218
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:15,599
that was last week I think it's 2 to the

219
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,829
15th datagrams now we keep fiddling

220
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,509
without trying to get the numbers right

221
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:20,519
but the problem is you want to have

222
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:23,550
enough to be able to carry the largest

223
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,589
PDU that makes sense in this protocol

224
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,180
but you also don't want really

225
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:29,100
ridiculously large numbers of frames

226
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,680
flying around with a relatively

227
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:36,660
lightweight transport protocol so it's a

228
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,399
trade-off thing not so the upper frame

229
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,259
here is showing you what the transport

230
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,939
headers look like and it's pretty

231
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,709
straightforward is just version number

232
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:47,430
there's a sequence number so that we can

233
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:49,319
tell whether or not we're doing the same

234
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,079
print the same PD we're doing last time

235
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,490
or not let's actually change the Elbit

236
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,170
is still the same there's the Datagram

237
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,879
number the Datagram length there's a

238
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,860
checksum because you don't send stuff

239
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,420
around raw Ethernet frames without a

240
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,339
checksum if you want to survive and

241
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,040
there's the payload and that's all there

242
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:09,839
is to it so you put together a bunch of

243
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,730
these data grams you do a PD you and at

244
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,309
that point you've got a PD you type and

245
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,800
a payload lengths and signature stuff

246
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:20,750
which we'll talk about in a bit and

247
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:24,779
you've got some payload not much to it

248
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,819
we're not running TCP ok there's no IP

249
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,889
at one we're doing this so that that's

250
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,259
not going to work in any case we want

251
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,879
something lightweight Randy likes to

252
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,839
think of this as TCP like I don't think

253
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,029
it's that complicated

254
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,679
I used to maintain a TCP implementation

255
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,670
this is orders of magnitude less

256
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,860
complicated this is more like TFTP

257
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,229
but it works okay it's simple it gets

258
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,640
the data through and we have a little

259
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,350
bit of mechanism for being able to deal

260
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,120
with retransmissions and out of order

261
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,070
delivery and that sort of thing and back

262
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,290
off because we're trying to learn from

263
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,080
the mistakes of the 1990s and not just

264
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,990
flood everything all the time it's

265
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,580
pretty simple and I think it's stable at

266
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,230
this point we might end between a little

267
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,709
bit more depending on discussions about

268
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,360
you know large numbers of frames flying

269
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,150
around and having to retransmit all of

270
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:16,109
them if you lose something but it's been

271
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:18,360
pretty stable for months now the stuff

272
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,829
above that is a stateful session per

273
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,649
peer okay so you've got a relationship

274
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:26,369
between two peers as a session pretty

275
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,010
straightforward we do have a way of

276
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,409
great of gracefully restarting now this

277
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,150
is one of the carrier enhancements it's

278
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,960
mostly a good thing it adds complexity

279
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,370
still under discussion but Kara likes to

280
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,770
think of this as being very very much

281
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,560
like BGP I'm an old DNS guy to me the

282
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,000
mechanism looks a lot like DNS but it's

283
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,980
basically the same kind of mechanism in

284
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,340
either case you've got a serial number

285
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,470
okay so you send stuff around and what

286
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,449
serial number was that all right and

287
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,770
then if you have to restart the open

288
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,630
message now has a serial number what

289
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,590
serial number was that I hacked and you

290
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,910
can have a lot of complicated

291
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,429
discussions about exactly how to

292
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,500
implement this but the basic mechanism

293
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,330
is trivial it's just where was I

294
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,250
how do I get to where I need to be send

295
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:13,050
be the difference okay we do have

296
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,820
mechanisms we had to add an explicit act

297
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,940
mechanism because we discovered there a

298
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,290
couple of places we're detecting

299
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,370
duplicates was a little tricky so

300
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,370
there's actually an explicit back

301
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,350
mechanism for everything now and we do

302
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,939
didn't retransmit if stuff doesn't

303
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:31,169
assume it's evolving into a small

304
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:33,930
transport protocol as we said um hello

305
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,880
frames and keepalive frames sorry PDUs

306
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,040
are still different because they have

307
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,600
somewhat different requirements there's

308
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,750
some discussion about whether or not we

309
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,280
really need the hello and keep alive but

310
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,820
to be different things if we were just

311
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,500
beaconing the hellos all the time that

312
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,790
would be an indication that the end

313
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,920
point is still alive so why do you need

314
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,178
to keep alive but the heath lives are

315
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,940
intended to be Malta

316
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,889
unicast between two piers and yes I'm

317
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,549
still here yes I'm still here yes I'm

318
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:02,369
still here

319
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:05,418
as opposed to hello which is the hi I

320
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:07,860
just came up anybody want to talk to me

321
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:09,899
in the case of a point-to-point link

322
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,100
which is the usual case you only need to

323
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,658
do the hellos when you're starting up

324
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,730
once you've got the pier you know who

325
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:16,950
the address is at the other end the the

326
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,899
the link layer dress is at the other end

327
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,450
you don't really need to keep beaconing

328
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:24,199
the lows in a multi drop thing we've got

329
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,429
multi access your conventional Ethernet

330
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,629
and it's not just point-to-point you

331
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,549
might need to keep beaconing them so

332
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:31,529
that new people joining get the message

333
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,820
so they're just these two PT is that

334
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,559
they look a lot alike but they have

335
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,759
somewhat different behavior so at least

336
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,408
for the moment they're still separate

337
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,799
we'll revisit whether or not they need

338
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,480
to be merged at some point oh sorry that

339
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,860
got to this a little early so yeah we

340
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,419
don't need to repeat the hello as if

341
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,709
it's just a point-to-point link because

342
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,220
once you know the other endpoint you're

343
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:53,399
not learning anything new okay some new

344
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,409
stuff encapsulation flags we had but we

345
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:57,928
didn't have I don't think the announced

346
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:00,480
withdrawal bitch and I don't think we

347
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:03,749
had the over-under bit either care the

348
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,340
over-under bit is new since last so this

349
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:07,889
is an overlay underly thing if you've

350
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,439
got a complex topology and you've got it

351
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:12,719
as a backbone within your rack and

352
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,159
you've got you know land that you're

353
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,119
using just for communication between the

354
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,499
Tor and the servers within the rack but

355
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,600
you also want to be able to take things

356
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:23,190
that are in side the rack and have them

357
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,809
have public addresses outside the rack

358
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,159
so you've got this overlay underlay

359
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,809
mechanism the underlay is the

360
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,100
conversation within the rack the

361
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,990
overlays the stuff you're transporting

362
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,070
out so we just have a bit to indicate

363
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,539
which kind of address you're talking

364
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,070
about for any particular encapsulation

365
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:39,269
because it makes it easier to sort out

366
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:41,249
which things need to propagate where we

367
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:43,289
had an explicit ACK and error message we

368
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:46,679
looked at doing it separately and the

369
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:50,009
code was 98% the same code so we just

370
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,470
Vale with it so an ACK is an error

371
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:57,600
message with an error code of no error

372
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:59,399
just not much simpler okay we have this

373
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,850
vendor extension mixin that was actually

374
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:04,739
in I think by the time we're in Prague

375
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,480
it uses enterprise numbers all on nibs

376
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,430
because it was an existing mechanism is

377
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,960
used for extensions

378
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,340
other things we've actually got a use

379
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,510
case for that already with somebody

380
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,129
doing something in another working group

381
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,810
it's pretty trivial ok logical link

382
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,010
endpoint identifiers I looked at this

383
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,260
and said what the hell is that Randy

384
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:25,610
just says I just made it up um the

385
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:27,610
problem is that I go back far enough

386
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,629
that when I was doing device drivers

387
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,419
Ethernet was called you know Dix

388
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:35,630
Ethernet you know there wasn't a lot to

389
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,790
it these days layer 2 was a complicated

390
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,190
ecosystem with multiple layers of stuff

391
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,450
and sometimes your MAC address isn't

392
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,530
really your MAC address or your MAC

393
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,480
address isn't really an endpoint

394
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,310
identifier or there's you know a bunch

395
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,880
of bonding stuff going on or god only

396
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,530
knows what so in a simple Dix Ethernet

397
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,910
world your endpoint would identify would

398
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,470
just be your MAC address but sometimes

399
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,570
the topology is more complicated than

400
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,100
that at layer 2 and you need something

401
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,770
that's your system identifier so it's a

402
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,860
something abstract concept system

403
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:06,050
identifier and which interface did you

404
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,149
receive this on that's generally the

405
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:12,139
endpoint identifier in terms of what

406
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,950
you're writing in your code ok and

407
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,340
there's a question do we need a

408
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,930
mandatory to implement link layer and

409
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,590
point identifiers that's still under

410
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,850
discussion we don't know yet okay so we

411
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,879
have two implementations there's my

412
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,379
somewhat older one in Python 3 which

413
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,760
hasn't been updated since we changed the

414
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,830
name from lsle so it's still called

415
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:36,260
Alyssa we there's a new one from one of

416
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:37,429
our co-workers and golang we're plan I

417
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,730
putting this stuff into our operating

418
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:42,200
system and we're hoping maybe we'll be

419
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,390
able able to do some kind of an

420
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,670
interrupt thing in Singapore and send

421
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,730
this stuff to last call still up in the

422
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,780
air but that's the hope and as I

423
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,200
mentioned we've already got somebody

424
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:56,330
using the extension mechanism so Niraj

425
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:01,490
has this thing over in deaths the evpn

426
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:03,320
mechanism ok we really want people to

427
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,390
review the draft randy says this every

428
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,889
time it's still true please review the

429
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,900
draft it would be nice if we could get

430
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,250
review before having to send it to

431
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,380
working group last colleges to wake

432
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,870
people up I want to specifically

433
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,700
acknowledge Paul Condon thank you for

434
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,010
having repeatedly reviewed the thing for

435
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,920
is very much appreciated but it would be

436
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,150
nice of other people to please

437
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,360
okay and that's it for the main protocol

438
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:29,420
the other one is this is like sixty

439
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,270
seconds okay so we added another PD you

440
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,560
type for transporting around sort of the

441
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,660
minimal upper layer protocol

442
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,810
configuration information that's really

443
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,820
it right there this one slide okay we're

444
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,260
really hoping to keep that to the

445
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,450
minimum amount of necessary

446
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,770
configuration stuff for you know we

447
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,740
don't want to turn this into all of BGP

448
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,090
again just what's the minimum you need

449
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,470
care can speak more to what actually

450
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,110
needs to go in here than I can but

451
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:57,530
that's pretty much it for the other one

452
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,929
we don't want to be replacing BGP we

453
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,280
don't want Beaton conflicting with BGP

454
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,110
that's part of the reason for keeping it

455
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,540
minimal the less you say the less likely

456
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,479
these are contradicting something yes

457
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,480
care capital R cos this is the minimum

458
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,310
requirement needed to exchange BGP data

459
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,370
so that you can establish automatic

460
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:19,280
peering between two nodes okay

461
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:23,600
kind of like BGP discovery fuel yeah

462
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,430
pretty much okay okay

463
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,899
so here's the here's the explanation of

464
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,110
what we have currently expect to go in

465
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,360
for BGP okay you've got your ass and

466
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:36,500
your before peering address prefix

467
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,899
length BGP authentication data okay

468
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,650
that's it for make breeze oh um I did

469
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,240
not do any slides for the signing

470
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,740
mechanism we've been working on because

471
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,090
that's really we the draft isn't

472
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,330
published yet so there's no point asking

473
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:52,189
you to read the draft but we've managed

474
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,590
to keep it very very simple so far just

475
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,990
going to talk about it for one minute

476
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,070
it's basically just signatures okay and

477
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,420
there are three levels you can do with

478
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,800
this you can have screw it I don't care

479
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,780
about signatures at all in which case

480
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,310
you leave the signature field empty you

481
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,320
can have what the security world is

482
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,090
called tofu trust on first use where

483
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,250
it's like I send you a key and you say

484
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,659
okay I never seen you before but fine

485
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,460
whatever the rest of this session will

486
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,940
be signed with this key okay fine

487
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,220
whatever

488
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,750
so all that that proves to you is that

489
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,190
somebody hasn't jumped in and hijack the

490
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,920
session sometimes that's all you need

491
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,910
depends on your on your operation model

492
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,030
the third level is very very lightweight

493
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,460
PKI

494
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:30,649
yes the word BKI is scary but we had

495
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,210
help from a friend who said no you do

496
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,610
not damn well need x.509 here

497
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,460
so the PKI is basically just a signature

498
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:40,889
the certificate literally consists of a

499
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:47,120
signature by a certification Authority

500
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:47,120
that's it all it's telling you is this

501
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,800
il3 dll speaker is an authorized member

502
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,350
of the group as opposed to say the

503
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,149
janitors laptop that's all it's telling

504
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,649
you if you care about that level of

505
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,820
assurance the mechanism is there if you

506
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,890
don't care about it you don't have to

507
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,419
use it we've got the draft mostly

508
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,340
written it should be ready within a

509
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,870
month or so at the most and certainly

510
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:15,120
ready for people to review by the next

511
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:18,540
meeting that's it questions on that

512
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,729
authentication Paul Condon sorry yeah on

513
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,129
that authentication how big is that

514
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,530
signature at currently do you know it

515
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,770
depends on the algorithm but it's not

516
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,990
huge we're using the three algorithms

517
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:34,940
we're talking about are all elliptic

518
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:39,750
curve algorithm so this is not Russell

519
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:49,650
how big is DSA I'm forgetting you see

520
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:52,080
DSA sorry so 32 bits and the other yeah

521
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,780
but so you know it's noticeable but is

522
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,770
not huge and the other ones we're

523
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,190
looking at her on that same order of

524
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:01,290
magnitude yeah okay um I had a great

525
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,450
update on this draft there was a lot of

526
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,040
changes and clarifications that then

527
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,960
that the additions of the overlay

528
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,050
underlay things brought a lot of

529
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,140
questions up for me anyway

530
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:15,600
so that's primarily for the I would say

531
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,700
you know the Geneva clan style over they

532
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,159
underlaid you don't consider a VLAN

533
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,530
layer to as a overlay underlay right I

534
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:26,670
think I think the VLANs are actually why

535
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:28,889
you also modified the lle I you know

536
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,140
created the need for an El Elyon because

537
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,390
over a single Ethernet wire you may have

538
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,850
multiple VLANs which results in multiple

539
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,710
interfaces and that I think is that that

540
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,389
accurate I don't know invited care to

541
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,890
respond to that yeah that's correct

542
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:45,180
here for Dolores and this is also

543
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,080
assuming say for example a server has an

544
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,420
overlay addresses

545
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,600
in a manner that can be made accessible

546
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,300
at the LIA where l3 DL can announce it

547
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,980
out if that happens we did just a bit

548
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,629
here that can differentiate saying this

549
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,360
is an overlay versus an underlay address

550
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,980
yeah so so effectively that allows you

551
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,100
to sort of aggregate rather than having

552
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,270
to run instances of stuff at that layer

553
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,610
I'm wondering if you can do a similar

554
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,960
thing at the VLAN layer because what I'm

555
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,570
seeing you're gonna be right now I think

556
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,470
you're running an instance of l3 dl /

557
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,389
VLAN you know and the hellos and

558
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,950
potential keeper lives might generate a

559
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:25,210
lot of chatter I'm wondering if there's

560
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:26,860
a way to do a similar approach of that

561
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,170
as well anyway it's a thought that a

562
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,300
fundamental one nice l-ltp that's kind

563
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,310
of one of the one of the benefits of LTP

564
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,230
kind of runs below the VLAN layer so

565
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,740
it's speaking so you have the ability to

566
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,120
aggregate that stuff so anyway I I think

567
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,410
so that was my other questions just to

568
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,060
be clear the lle I if I was running

569
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,520
multiple VLANs on a wire I would be

570
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,340
using lle yeah I could identify which

571
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,700
instance of VLAN effectively that that

572
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:57,010
that's running on and another system

573
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,170
identifier could be like Mac identifier

574
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,020
plus a VLAN ID or something like that

575
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,970
maybe right yeah

576
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,350
ah cubed LR Chris Paul it would be great

577
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,260
if you can send that out on a mailing

578
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,820
list I think that's a great topic

579
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,290
because most probably I'll forget but

580
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,450
I'll pick it up on the mailing they saw

581
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,149
an email that would be fantastic thank

582
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,700
you okay thank you Paul

583
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:24,600
anybody else okay

584
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:29,350
thanks thank you all right so the next

585
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:33,149
slide will be an update I think all your

586
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,149
an update for LG db2

587
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,000
enik um wander back there bleats back

588
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:51,870
there they went had a chance to sign the

589
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,260
blue sheets okay thanks okay I'm Paul

590
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:58,530
Congdon and I'm also acknowledging Paul

591
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:01,230
Batra he's not here he but he is working

592
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:04,230
on with me on the I Triple E to kind of

593
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:07,650
help do this definition so we have a

594
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,780
project in return I won a B D H I can

595
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,790
give you the whole I Triple E decoder

596
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,920
ring for all the letters if you're

597
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:17,550
interested but fundamentally this is a

598
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,350
what we call lldp version two so first

599
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,210
major disclaimer I'm on an individual

600
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,909
here I'm not speaking on behalf of I

601
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,440
Triple E so you know I'm just telling

602
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,340
you my perspective of what we're doing

603
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,800
here so just as background you can look

604
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,500
at these at your leisure we originally

605
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,409
proposed a update to lldp back in

606
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,470
January and then we did sort of a

607
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:42,150
initial first cut of evaluation against

608
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,340
the lsv our requirements because the

609
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,370
objective was could we support try to

610
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:51,270
support what lsv our needs by making

611
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,370
modifications to lldp there's been some

612
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:57,960
liaison exchanges back and forth between

613
00:30:53,370 --> 00:31:01,439
a Triple E and ITF on the topic and you

614
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,320
know we we now have a project approved

615
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,930
there's some final logistics within the

616
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,179
I Triple E to actually get it

617
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:11,130
you know slowly staff but we're at a

618
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,770
point where we can kind of move forward

619
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,420
so what was kind of driving all this you

620
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,010
know from our perspective you know it's

621
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,340
kind of like discovery protocols going

622
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:23,040
wild everywhere there was the work in

623
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,409
Ellis VR as you guys all know about

624
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,409
there's also been some other discovery

625
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:31,920
in the ITF such as the ID our neighbor

626
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:36,450
auto discovery we even worked with the

627
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:39,690
ITF on a virtual station that interface

628
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:42,210
discovery protocol for nvo 3 and that

629
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,830
takes advantage of lldp but sometimes

630
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,470
the amount of information that needs to

631
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,850
be exchanged there is large so well if

632
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,650
he doesn't always fit perfectly

633
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,250
there's also another project and the I

634
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,790
Triple E called Auto attach which does

635
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,590
assignment of V vids and

636
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,110
i Syd's if you're familiar with provider

637
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:02,500
backbone bridging that also runs into

638
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:04,479
size limitations with lldp but it's it's

639
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,120
a effectively an application running on

640
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,860
top of LOD P so there's a lot of a lot

641
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,489
of use a lot of need and we were really

642
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,649
stretching the needs for for LOD P so it

643
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:17,500
was clearly time to do something and

644
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,630
revise that protocol as we all know it's

645
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,850
pretty widely deployed people have you

646
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,650
know kind of quote used it and in many

647
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,209
different ways many different

648
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,280
environments not you know data centers

649
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,720
to wireless networks to you know campus

650
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,370
lands and there's a facility to define

651
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,710
your own information either as a

652
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:39,340
standards organization or as an

653
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:41,380
individual vendor and people have come

654
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,209
up with all kinds of use cases so the

655
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,610
amount of data that people are wanting

656
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,230
to send just keeps growing so so we

657
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:50,320
needed to start this project and so the

658
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:52,090
fundamental thing was to scale it to

659
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,639
allow what we call we're calling this

660
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,209
informally lldp applications or people

661
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,400
that use lldp data we want to be able to

662
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:03,970
scale the amount of data that they they

663
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,400
can share and so and clearly lsv our

664
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,290
requirements were one of those things we

665
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,240
also had requirements in and we're doing

666
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,700
time-sensitive networking you know debt

667
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,460
net style stuff in theatrically as well

668
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,220
and and there was a need to actually go

669
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,290
the opposite direction and shrink lldp

670
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,810
PDUs so that you can schedule them in

671
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:25,090
mix them in with other traffic so so

672
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:28,540
that's a facility that we're also doing

673
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:31,330
so this project is as an amendment to

674
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,090
the the current standard and it's going

675
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:37,030
to allow what we call TLB databases to

676
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:39,250
consists of multiple frames so so think

677
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:42,040
of what you have is a database it's just

678
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:45,520
a bunch of TLV so in in LS VR you have

679
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,770
the IP address encapsulation list of

680
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,889
various things that it's that that node

681
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:53,830
has that's part of an overall database

682
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,330
that it wants to share with its peer so

683
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:58,060
just think of it as you know a generic

684
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,980
database and now that database needs to

685
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:06,550
be bigger than what can fit in a single

686
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:08,380
layer to frame and so anyway let's see

687
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,000
what else that

688
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:13,000
one of the key advantages to was to

689
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,830
allow this new version of lldp nose to

690
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,480
still talk to the old version as though

691
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,759
they were an old version so if you have

692
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,040
LDP running all around anywhere else and

693
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,740
your new updated version you can still

694
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,529
exchange that first frames worth of data

695
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:28,959
and everything is fine it's just you

696
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:32,230
can't do more than one frame to an old

697
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,380
version that guy has to get upgraded so

698
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,400
anyway we think it's we think just this

699
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,760
facility and the way in which we're

700
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,460
doing the extension you know should

701
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,500
satisfy a lot of discovery needs for

702
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,139
other many of these new use cases that

703
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,900
are out there so what were some of these

704
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:53,139
objectives first one is to be completely

705
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,639
transparent to the users of lldp so

706
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,620
again like an application that's

707
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,000
expecting data we don't want that

708
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,310
application to have to change at all

709
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,250
it's just now allowed to send and

710
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,410
receive more data than it used to that's

711
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:08,260
the from the user level it should look

712
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,180
the same and so we again we want to

713
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,670
support you know more than one frame

714
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,279
worth of data I think initially lsv our

715
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,720
requirements were around 64 K they may

716
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,390
be bigger now it looked like or at least

717
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,700
you have the facility to send lots of

718
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:25,960
data so and then of course we want to as

719
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,850
I mentioned for time-sensitive

720
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,370
networking we also want to shrink things

721
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:32,860
if possible or have the ability to

722
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:35,160
configure it in a way to shrink the data

723
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:38,410
so that you can you can schedule it

724
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,180
again communicate with version ones it

725
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,430
should work over shared media although

726
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,589
we're gonna really more or less optimize

727
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:47,259
it for point-to-point so that will be

728
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,730
the the better use case and one of the

729
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,160
key things is we want to make sure we're

730
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,960
ensuring that the integrity of that data

731
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,600
so we know that we've received

732
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,240
everything that that pier is trying to

733
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,860
to advertise if you will and that's been

734
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,959
a useful that would be a useful feature

735
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,120
even in version one implementation some

736
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,230
people have implemented their own way of

737
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:10,210
doing that another key thing about this

738
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,730
new proposal so changes in the the most

739
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,770
recent proposal is that we support what

740
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,780
we're calling pacing of refrain of

741
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:19,120
frames at the receiver so in other words

742
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,400
instead of just blasting out a ton of

743
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,029
frames to a node that only has one

744
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,030
buffer for

745
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,350
we're gonna allow that receiver to

746
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,300
consume the data at whatever rate it

747
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,830
needs to so if it's a rich

748
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,050
implementation with a lot of memory it

749
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:35,120
may request a whole batch of frames but

750
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,880
if it's a very lightweight IOT type

751
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,980
implementation it may just get that data

752
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,470
one frame at a time it really it's so

753
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:47,690
it's receiver paste and that was a key

754
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:49,370
change in the latest proposal and again

755
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,230
we wanted we don't want to really try to

756
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,480
increase network traffic we're gonna

757
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,970
send more frames as you know lldp is a

758
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,820
periodic protocol every so often just

759
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:00,379
sends out the one frame so the version

760
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,240
two will look exactly like that they'll

761
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,520
still just be one frame that gets sent

762
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,890
out however if you need the extension

763
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,540
data a receiver will ask for it and then

764
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,310
you'll you'll transmit it so we won't

765
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,730
just be multi casting stuff all over the

766
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:15,680
place and then since we have the the

767
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,390
book open if you will and and and the

768
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,680
pin to modify it and let's look at maybe

769
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,640
some other things that might be of

770
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,390
interest

771
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,670
so maybe supporting a larger TLV itself

772
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:29,089
today the the sizes is restricted by the

773
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:33,230
format we could consider larger formats

774
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:36,530
for extensions and I know the

775
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:39,080
authentication idea is a high high want

776
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,150
here you guys have a draft in play for

777
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,690
that so that could be an example of

778
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:47,240
something is well to consider okay

779
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:50,090
so just as a quick reminder this is how

780
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,729
the current operation works very simple

781
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,530
protocol widely deployed think of these

782
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:57,620
as again we think of them as databases

783
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:59,720
it's just you have as a local agent I

784
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,120
have my local information I want to tell

785
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,390
people about so just periodically I send

786
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:08,210
it out and the receiver gets that and he

787
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:10,490
compares with what he got last time if

788
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,380
it's different he signals the

789
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,120
application that something's changed and

790
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,480
he updates everything so the entire

791
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,130
database got got updated and then if you

792
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,590
change something locally that'll trigger

793
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,740
the the transmission quicker so it's

794
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:28,700
it's very simple you know protocol not

795
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:32,750
too complicated so the proposal for the

796
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:35,180
new thing is to define use the current

797
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,660
frame format for the the level one but

798
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,879
to find a new

799
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:43,910
PDU or a new TLV in that PDU so again we

800
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,279
still have the same version one frame

801
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:50,129
that an lldp one implementation would be

802
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:54,200
able to receive it but will they define

803
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:56,400
a new lldp extension PDO so a new frame

804
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,129
and what we'll do is we're gonna

805
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,339
describe those new frames in a manifest

806
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:04,559
so the first frame that we send that

807
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:07,319
looks like lldp v1 it'll have an

808
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:10,289
additional TLV that has effectively a

809
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:11,999
manifest defining all the other tlvs

810
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:13,980
that are out there so then when you

811
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:16,288
receive that you'll be able to know if

812
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,509
you have all the extension data or not

813
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:20,400
and if you don't then you request it

814
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:22,319
frame at a time or batch at a time

815
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,930
whatever whatever you want so that's the

816
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:27,690
high level that's kind of how it works

817
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:30,529
so yeah the manifest defines a way to to

818
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:33,900
identify each of the extension frames

819
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:35,099
and again the transmission of those

820
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,839
extension frames is going to be

821
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:39,839
controlled by the receiver he's going to

822
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:41,670
pace it at what rate he wants I think

823
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,730
that's pretty clear and I'm going to the

824
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:47,190
details and the another important

825
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,259
attribute is we want a version one

826
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,869
implementation that receives an

827
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:53,880
extension PD you to basically ignore it

828
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,069
because if you recall a version one

829
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,390
implementation when it receives an lldp

830
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:59,430
frame it throws away everything it knew

831
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,129
before and replaces it with this one

832
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,569
frame new frames worth of data so we

833
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,609
have all these extra frames that are

834
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:07,890
extension frames we don't want an lldp

835
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:10,200
version one to even see them so we have

836
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,569
to think about how we do that and

837
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,538
there's various ways including you know

838
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:17,220
getting a new ethertype but i think the

839
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:20,180
current proposal right we're gonna try

840
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:24,029
to do it without getting a new ethertype

841
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,859
and so these new PDUs that have all the

842
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:28,289
extra data they'll have a new format

843
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:30,538
they'll still have the the chassis ID

844
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:32,759
port ID so you know who came from the

845
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:35,670
pier and then they'll have some way that

846
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:39,509
identifies them like I'm frame number 5

847
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,920
of 10 you know and that'll be a new part

848
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:43,049
and then the rest of it will just be tea

849
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,190
obese they could be new formatted team

850
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:46,380
Ovie's or they could just be the

851
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,900
existing ones we'll have to decide and

852
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,999
then there's this new it can request for

853
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,859
extension mess

854
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:54,468
so this is again how the receiver says

855
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:57,558
okay I'm missing frame five please give

856
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:59,539
me frame five or I'm missing frames one

857
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:02,869
through seven give me one through seven

858
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:05,509
and and then once the the receiver has

859
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:07,699
everything he he knows by the manifest

860
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:09,949
that that he's up-to-date and he can

861
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:13,279
signal the application that the date is

862
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:15,139
available so this will support you know

863
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:16,519
again shared media as well multiple

864
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,889
peers on shared media won't be as

865
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:23,899
optimized for shared media but it'll

866
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:26,839
it'll it'll work there and again we talk

867
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:28,719
about receiver pacing and you will only

868
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,578
ask for things that are out of date and

869
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,589
then there's no change to the periodic

870
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:35,779
transmissions you'll still periodically

871
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:40,669
transmit the first frame would the

872
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:43,539
manifest and the TTL would would rely on

873
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:46,459
that so in this situation

874
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:49,489
same same agents remember they just have

875
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:51,678
more data they have this manifest that's

876
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:54,319
required in the base TLV so when

877
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,719
something changes locally you'll send

878
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,129
out that first frame and the receiver

879
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,469
will get that and he'll look at that

880
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:03,319
manifest and compare and say hmm I'm

881
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:05,389
missing some some frames so he'll send a

882
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:07,459
request for extension and that'll be a

883
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:10,279
unicast packet it won't be multicast

884
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:11,658
it'll be unicast back to the to the

885
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,479
sender and then he'll send those

886
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:16,339
extension PDUs as he needs and once the

887
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:18,919
receiver has collected all of that data

888
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:20,719
it'll signal the application that

889
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:23,089
something's changed we've got a new a

890
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,409
new database and so again from the

891
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:25,069
applications perspective everything

892
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:27,649
looks the same

893
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:29,389
and then after so everything settles and

894
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:31,909
nothing's changing it just looks like

895
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:35,179
regular lldp you're sending out your

896
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:37,579
periodic frame with the manifest and if

897
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:39,799
somebody new joins they on a shared

898
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:43,909
media they would see that and and pick

899
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:46,699
up from there okay so as I mentioned we

900
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:50,119
had done an evaluation sort of what lsv

901
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:52,759
our requirements were in if I were to

902
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,889
say at 50,000 foot that you know your

903
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:58,039
LCR is doing a couple things like you

904
00:42:54,889 --> 00:43:00,529
said it's it's exchanging a database of

905
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,719
information encapsulation types and and

906
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:03,950
things and it's but it's also doing you

907
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:07,090
know this layer to lie

908
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:10,129
this and it may have an authentication

909
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:13,400
scheme and some vendor extensions and

910
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:15,560
things like that so if I look at with

911
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,560
our new proposal could can we support

912
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,210
these things these is sort of the the

913
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,020
guesstimate yes I think you know

914
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:26,540
obviously the lle I is just a chunk of

915
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,580
data relatively small attribute list is

916
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,550
the same we would just despite define a

917
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,140
TLB the authentication data we need to

918
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,260
see that's why I was asking the question

919
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:38,870
about the size because it would it fit

920
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:41,780
in the current TLV or do we need to grow

921
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:44,270
the size of a TLB I think the

922
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,130
encapsulation and addresses are fine one

923
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:49,400
thing to keep in mind this came up in a

924
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:53,720
hall conversation there's multiple types

925
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:56,090
of tlvs in lldp usually you just receive

926
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,839
one of them but it's possible to see

927
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:01,820
receive multiple of the same TLB type so

928
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,850
in other words if I have let's say a a

929
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:08,180
layer three encapsulation TLV that I

930
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:11,150
define for LS vr I K and I need to send

931
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,919
more encapsulations than will fit in one

932
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:16,310
TLB well I just send multiple of those

933
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,230
tlvs that works you don't have to you

934
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:21,590
know you only have one TLB of one type

935
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:23,450
so you can replicate stuff so keep the

936
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,340
lives the way they're defined in l3 DL

937
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:27,620
right now I'd be one second that's a

938
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:30,290
little bit too fast for lldp it's not

939
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,029
really designed to scale that way so we

940
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,040
would be looking for alternative ways to

941
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:37,820
try to address the the layer two

942
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,650
liveness requirement the acts are sort

943
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,240
of you know an implicit part here with

944
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,880
the manifests and knowing that you

945
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,250
you've got things and then we do have

946
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,890
vendor extensions that's already exist

947
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:50,360
today and it's been been widely used so

948
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,730
I think in general for the information

949
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,430
exchange that we need I think we should

950
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,990
be able to do it so if we wanted to

951
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:59,000
start to say hey could when we were

952
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,290
gonna use lldp for for LSB our

953
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,450
requirements what we really need to be

954
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:05,360
done well I think the first thing thing

955
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:08,240
would be we need a draft to write to

956
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,910
describe these new tlvs that are

957
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,399
specific to the IETF so so we would

958
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:15,830
create a internet draft that describe

959
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,080
the format of those TL B's we already

960
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:20,330
have a pretty much that format

961
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,730
Danelle 3dl maybe maybe it's maybe that

962
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,200
format work says is maybe it means a

963
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,040
slight modification but we would just

964
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:30,770
use lldp as a transport rather than it L

965
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,350
three DL or in addition to L 3 DL so we

966
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,240
would need a draft for that we would say

967
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,580
consider some alternatives for liveness

968
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,680
there's a standard we have connectivity

969
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,630
fault management it's pretty widely

970
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,580
deployed as well check your local

971
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:47,240
Broadcom chip it's probably already in

972
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,799
there so that already does layer 2 you

973
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,560
know liveness requires some

974
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,020
configuration but but that's there and

975
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:57,830
then of course make sure as we progress

976
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:00,850
this LTP v2 standard that you know it's

977
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:04,490
staying within it's meeting the needs of

978
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:06,170
LS VR so providing technical input

979
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,779
review I'm sure we could set up some

980
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:11,780
liaison style way of sharing documents

981
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:14,470
that's open and everybody can play so

982
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:17,240
that would be another suggestion so

983
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:20,209
anyway that's it there's a so the next

984
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,640
steps for the project itself is we're in

985
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:25,310
the technical contribution phase right

986
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,150
now love to see open source

987
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:31,009
implementation taking the L LD PD and

988
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:35,180
you know forking it and adding these

989
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:37,130
things to prove it out will we're going

990
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,799
to go through an evaluation of what

991
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:42,230
actual text changes need to happen to

992
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,630
make insert this into the new document

993
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:47,510
and then at some point near future it

994
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:49,880
will will create a draft by an

995
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,890
individual contributor and then at some

996
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,570
point the an editor would be it be

997
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:57,080
assigned we're still waiting for the

998
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:59,690
final formal formal approval from the

999
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:03,380
highest levels of I Triple E but that's

1000
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:05,090
expected in September 27th so that's

1001
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,680
kind of where we are I have a whole

1002
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,240
bunch of you know frame formats and

1003
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,430
stuff in the backup if you want to take

1004
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:15,399
a look at that but I don't think we need

1005
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:15,399
to cover that is there any questions

1006
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:29,110
hi John Scudder says this was a you know

1007
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:31,810
sort of compelling ad good elevator

1008
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,850
pitch that and I was glad to see your

1009
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:37,180
your bullet that you just spoke to on

1010
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:39,640
the last or second last slide you don't

1011
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,879
have to go back where you said you know

1012
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,470
let's we can come up with a way to

1013
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,480
provide provide the spec so that people

1014
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,859
can read it because that was you know

1015
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,050
like by the time you had gotten through

1016
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,640
your first few slides and you know

1017
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,380
sitting in the back thinking okay where

1018
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,660
can I go grab the spec and read it

1019
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,250
because I mean it's great to see slides

1020
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,670
but until you get to read this back it's

1021
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,500
I mean you know so I sure I would look

1022
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,180
forward to you know getting some info

1023
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,670
but where to where to grab that spec

1024
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,440
sure as pretty much the next step

1025
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:10,240
yeah so that when we do draft

1026
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,360
developments of the specs it is a

1027
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,589
working group only document so they're

1028
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,720
password-protected it's kind of a widely

1029
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:21,310
known password but I didn't I didn't say

1030
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,890
that but also we have means for you know

1031
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:25,720
formal liaison between standards

1032
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:31,000
organizations to make those drafts

1033
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:33,580
available so be honest yes that is that

1034
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,250
password but anybody can be a working

1035
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,500
new participant it's really easy we just

1036
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:40,570
do a it's just contacted working group

1037
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,940
chair you've got the information so we

1038
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:45,430
have a lot of contributors it's an open

1039
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,170
organization right it's there's no it's

1040
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:49,450
not difficult to join and become a

1041
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,390
working group member I'd also like to

1042
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,580
add that during the what we call the

1043
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:57,029
task group ballot phase which is you

1044
00:48:54,580 --> 00:49:01,360
know the early phases of the first rap

1045
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:04,120
we pretty much will accept comments from

1046
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,760
from anybody you know I mean you I it's

1047
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,440
the there is a process but we typically

1048
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,560
are gonna take input from anybody so you

1049
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,270
know you can you don't have to be voting

1050
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,640
membership and all that kind of stuff to

1051
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:20,200
make a comment exactly I mean any phase

1052
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:22,600
actually yeah comments are accepted from

1053
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,460
anyone and treated equally you not have

1054
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,580
to be a voting number you just

1055
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:30,700
contribute comment even in the very last

1056
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:31,700
stage that is the sponsor balance even

1057
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,299
is possible

1058
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:40,669
article si as an official way to to

1059
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:42,440
accept comments from anyone yeah yeah so

1060
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,839
there were at the early early slides or

1061
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,700
some pointers to our public web Docs

1062
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:51,460
where you can see the current state of

1063
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:55,118
things - yeah of course

1064
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:59,359
get access we don't have draft yet so as

1065
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,910
Paul keeps saying a contribution driven

1066
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,308
yeah this contribution do as well so we

1067
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:06,848
need to we cannot give you a draft yet

1068
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:23,170
we need to have contributions first

1069
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:26,119
correct any other questions all right

1070
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:30,230
maybe closer all right so our next

1071
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:33,250
presenter will be cure that surprised

1072
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:43,970
you know all right for the beach be SPF

1073
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:45,130
trapped update yes it works morning

1074
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,899
folks

1075
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,250
I'm gonna give a quick update on Alice

1076
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:53,210
we are

1077
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:57,290
bgp SPF from a status standpoint the

1078
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:59,780
draft was updated on Sunday by AC it's

1079
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:03,920
in a fairly fairly stable state we have

1080
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:07,780
an implementation now on it full

1081
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,490
implementation is now done on the spec

1082
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:13,069
there is another implementation there is

1083
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:16,520
also on the way probably from an open

1084
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:18,349
source community and at least three

1085
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,530
operators have signed up to test and

1086
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:22,280
evaluate the protocol itself to see how

1087
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:24,200
it operates

1088
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:29,150
from a cost standpoint it's fairly

1089
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:31,220
stable as part of implementing the draft

1090
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:35,079
the yang model is already in place like

1091
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:40,970
I had mentioned earlier the formats of

1092
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:42,500
SPF reuses LS Safi of bgp itself so when

1093
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,169
we designed the model we naturally

1094
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:48,520
designed the model for LS

1095
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:52,490
toughy also and we will come up with a

1096
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:56,750
draft for Singapore ITF again the model

1097
00:51:52,490 --> 00:52:00,979
itself is fairly straightforward we do

1098
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:03,530
want to start working on while we work

1099
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,930
on the mod models draft we do want to

1100
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,880
start working on protocol implementation

1101
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,129
draft and probably an experienced draft

1102
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,069
if possible and people keep on telling

1103
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:15,020
me that this is a new protocol while I

1104
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:16,849
tend to think of this as just a BGP Safi

1105
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,990
extension but if it's a new protocol we

1106
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:23,150
probably should have an implementation

1107
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:25,669
and experience draft from an

1108
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:27,890
implementation perspective all sections

1109
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:31,190
of draft have been implemented pretty

1110
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:33,670
much all of them there was challenge in

1111
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:36,319
generating in some cases what the remote

1112
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:40,280
router ID can be when the servers don't

1113
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:42,980
run BGP SPF or when you start to have

1114
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,890
appearing model that is reflection base

1115
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:48,170
which is not an inbound peering model we

1116
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:51,259
basically gather this information either

1117
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,940
from lldp or l3 DL or the protocol of

1118
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:55,460
choice we figure out who's the remote

1119
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:59,660
endpoint on the link use that

1120
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:03,349
information to source and compute SPF as

1121
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:05,440
we need then again PFD is always used to

1122
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:08,839
leverage for abide by directional link

1123
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,170
verification so we do that using DFT we

1124
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:13,819
make sure PFD is turned on and as long

1125
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:17,839
as the link is up the neighbors ship is

1126
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:20,540
up finally from intro of also standpoint

1127
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:24,020
we ran this against different IGP

1128
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:27,170
protocols as draft has mentioned it does

1129
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:29,299
give higher preference to LS VR and from

1130
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,520
that perspective when you start to do

1131
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:33,500
tiebreaking it's pretty straightforward

1132
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,240
where you take LS via routes as a

1133
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,010
preference give them a higher preference

1134
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:40,250
and implement them install them in

1135
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:42,410
fibbin forwarding so from an

1136
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:45,440
implementation strength standpoint it's

1137
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:48,640
fairly simple and straightforward as

1138
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,900
soon as we get second implementation

1139
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:55,460
from the open source we like to start

1140
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:57,799
doing Interop the draft that's all I

1141
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,000
have the drafts like I said again in

1142
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:01,370
fairly stable

1143
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,740
State we would really welcome reviews at

1144
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:05,960
this time any feedback comments would be

1145
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,799
appreciated because the implementations

1146
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:11,900
are under way we can change it if needed

1147
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:15,590
or else consider pushing it towards

1148
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:19,370
Ellis call probably seen from at

1149
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:32,450
Singapore ITF and maybe later yeah it's

1150
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:37,000
gonna address reviews but not any

1151
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:39,470
questions they always told me that

1152
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:51,970
replacing distance-vector in BGP is

1153
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:51,970
nearly impossible ah stand now thank you

1154
00:54:55,330 --> 00:55:00,740
so that's the end of the draft reviews

1155
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:04,310
for this agenda we didn't want to cover

1156
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:07,609
a couple of closing comments in the next

1157
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:10,790
steps at this point so we just spoke of

1158
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:13,520
it now and there there's a number of

1159
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:16,040
drafts that we have that have matured

1160
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,200
over the last while and we do need to

1161
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,600
get some kind of Rio Dental I of

1162
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,419
reviewers and why we want to get those

1163
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:25,730
reviews done for two basic purposes we

1164
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,530
address meeting curvature but it's

1165
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:29,270
really important to get a bit of a

1166
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:31,370
better cross-section review so we can

1167
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:33,770
actually validate that make sure that we

1168
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:36,710
have something we can actually take a

1169
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:39,400
working last call what I'd like to do is

1170
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:43,100
identify those on the mailing list and

1171
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,990
we're gonna look for volunteers now just

1172
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,310
as a show of hands that I want to figure

1173
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:50,060
out what I'm gonna face in the mailing

1174
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:52,100
list here who would be willing to do

1175
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:54,410
reviews for some of these documents that

1176
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,730
we really require these for I mean I'm

1177
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:56,240
not suggesting you're committing right

1178
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,280
now

1179
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,750
for the review but I need to try to get

1180
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,610
an assessment or we're trying to get us

1181
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:03,470
it's gonna whom will I will actually be

1182
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:05,930
able to dig into these documents and

1183
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:07,959
help us make sure we flush out some of

1184
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:10,879
the data there so just trying to pick up

1185
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,540
tests here show up and of you would be

1186
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,840
willing to do review

1187
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:17,119
[Music]

1188
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:19,520
not just in general like there's some

1189
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:26,210
document that we've reviewed that you

1190
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:29,750
would be willing to review ruffs kind of

1191
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:32,330
interested yeah you should review your

1192
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:35,540
own drop by the document even if you do

1193
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:37,490
a good job checks and balance okay so we

1194
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,619
have a few we're gonna probably then

1195
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:42,290
solicit a little bit more looks like at

1196
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:44,450
about seven ends you need to eat there I

1197
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,920
we still want a bit up a wider selection

1198
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,930
reviewers so we're gonna have to figure

1199
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,790
out how we're gonna drag a few folks in

1200
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:52,069
to help us there I'm not sure how we're

1201
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:54,320
gonna date everyone but that's going to

1202
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:57,380
be our big bar at this point we do know

1203
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,859
we have the LSB our sorry you know

1204
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,510
you've put notes up there great we do

1205
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:05,330
have the yang work to kind of work

1206
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,920
through so I Ignace thank you for

1207
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:09,230
bringing it up to us we'll make sure

1208
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,150
that we kind of get that going I think

1209
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:12,859
we're a little maybe behind there I'm

1210
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:14,390
not exactly sure we're gonna try to

1211
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:16,848
catch up is that was one of our key

1212
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:19,730
deliverables you know it's important to

1213
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:22,280
operationalize this um so expect over

1214
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:24,050
the next week or so we're gonna have to

1215
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,180
work with Gunther to figure out how

1216
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:27,950
we're gonna drag people in to get these

1217
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,140
reduce time is that's to me that's the

1218
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:32,000
biggest bar we have this point to make

1219
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,859
sure that we're ready for actual work

1220
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,050
culottes calls so I really don't want to

1221
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:38,630
go up the chain with with documents that

1222
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:43,400
then receive review post us you know

1223

1227
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,630
okay we had lots of real pretty Q&A now

1228
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:55,640
