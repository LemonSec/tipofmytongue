1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,950
nated start time oh it's 10 boom there

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,860
we go

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,230
this is the note well oh you're in the

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,320
IDR working group you are hoping to be

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,340
in another working group you picked the

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,720
wrong one oh this is the no well this is

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,810
the last time you'll see it this week I

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:29,519
hope but it's just as important as it

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,040
was on Monday or Sunday or Saturday so

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,730
we have it well we are gonna hold the

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,140
rest of the chairs littering I mean

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,930
slides for the end and get through the

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,530
technical content first and sort of with

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:51,690
the intention that then if conversation

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,160
happens to run long on the main thing

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,610
that we're gonna cover during our part

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,260
is Charter stuff so the conversation

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,000
went short great if the conversation

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,470
runs long well we're not running into

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,060
anyone elses time and we don't have to

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:11,009
cut it off so that yep there's we have

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,960
an agenda it's pretty much like the

23
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:15,060
agenda we've posted before except we had

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
to slide one thing from Wednesday on to

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,289
today but we had enough time so that's

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:26,539
okay

27
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:26,539
so I think non-first okay

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:02:29,910
oh that's it's okay

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:32,540
I think it's it's fine what's the magic

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:43,079
email address you're supposed to

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:46,340
assistance this one's up yeah so we have

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,340
a screen over there it's not ideal

33
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,460
[Music]

34
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:37,078
is next from working yeah yeah okay okay

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:41,429
good morning this is an update on the

36
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:46,409
RFC 7750 to draft it was first presented

37
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:49,019
in Prague and I would like to point out

38
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,030
that Stefano provide his affiliation is

39
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,720
not correctly mentioned in the slide it

40
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,720
should be Wow

41
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:03,720
so to recap bt pls has been you know

42
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:07,560
widely implemented and deployed now the

43
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,799
best draft came about before Prague to

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,730
clarify an update on certain things that

45
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,298
I would say we have learnt from the

46
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,159
development and deployment experience

47
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:23,250
some of the key things which the draft

48
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,310
clarifies are you know on the slide here

49
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:30,660
and all of the changes are mentioned in

50
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:34,560
the appendix in the traffic itself this

51
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:39,389
draft would actually obsolete RFC seven

52
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:42,060
seven five two got some good feedback

53
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:45,810
and inputs from the working group

54
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,479
members on various aspects and we hope

55
00:04:45,810 --> 00:05:08,580
to continue to incorporate and update it

56
00:04:48,479 --> 00:05:14,460
as we go along so it focus on so the

57
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:16,289
updates in a version one it's the key

58
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,409
thing is these are the key updates in

59
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:21,810
version one one of them is that the RFC

60
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:26,130
didn't actually talk about or describe

61
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:29,999
how in the case of OSPF the land subnet

62
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:33,209
would get advertised via BGP are

63
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:35,969
so this has been clarified it's it's to

64
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:39,889
be done with a prefix and NRI that is

65
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:42,689
originated by the dr or the sudo node

66
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,819
based on feedback there have some

67
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:47,759
changes in the private use code point

68
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:52,229
space and other minor editorial changes

69
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:56,009
to correct clarify an IPR which was

70
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:59,099
declared on RFC 775 to has also been

71
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:04,589
applied to this document adrian has

72
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:08,248
filed that so the remainder of this

73
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:10,799
presentation wanted to you know get

74
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:13,379
feedback from the working group on a few

75
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:15,748
key elements that we have been

76
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:19,649
discussing offline with some of the

77
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:24,469
members the first of that is regarding

78
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:28,259
ordering of tlvs in the PGP LS attribute

79
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:32,639
RFC 775 to had this exact text which

80
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:35,369
says that for the NLRA part and to

81
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,360
handle unknown tlvs and pepe unknown NL

82
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:42,839
arise all tlvs must be ordered you know

83
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,209
an ascending order and also I mean there

84
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,449
is more text on the content as well when

85
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,289
there is to analyze of the to TL B's of

86
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:53,189
the same type

87
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:55,909
now some implementations have you know

88
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:59,939
kind of interpreted this to imply that

89
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:03,839
TLB is in DGP LS attribute as well must

90
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:08,429
be ordered the best draft version that's

91
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:10,939
posted had the text saying that tlvs

92
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:14,279
need not be ordered in any specific way

93
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:17,989
because you know it's probably not

94
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:22,049
necessary or required but we've got a

95
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:26,248
proposal to change this text to say that

96
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:30,058
the producer has to you know sort it but

97
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:32,699
a receiver should not know consider the

98
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:36,059
TL B's I mean consider attribute as

99
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:39,289
malformed if the TLB is appear in a no

100
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:42,329
unsorted order so this allows

101
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,500
implementations - or rather recommends

102
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,390
implementations

103
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,050
the originators who send in a sorted

104
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:51,719
order but does not consider malformed on

105
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,210
the receiver so this is one thing which

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,990
you would like to get feedback from the

107
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,520
group members here and on the list and

108
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,720
based on that we would I mean right now

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:08,969
the proposal is to go and update as we

110
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,880
discuss right now the other key part

111
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,430
which you need to discuss and share is

112
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,909
this new text been added in the best

113
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,940
draft to describe a problem which

114
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:26,280
probably has and might have been

115
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:30,830
overlooked by by developers or people

116
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,659
deploying BG pls but at least some folks

117
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:38,309
have you know discovered or found this

118
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:40,849
out over the years and this is in a

119
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:45,689
topology as shown in the diagram here

120
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:50,280
where if the PGP LS producers continue

121
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:55,230
to advertise the topology objects the NL

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:58,170
are eyes as they are in the IGP LSP

123
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:02,760
database then it's possible that in

124
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:04,979
certain certain configuration example

125
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,580
for example when it we are distributing

126
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,560
wire out reflector or when the consumer

127
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,070
application is getting multiple fields

128
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,030
that it may get wrong or inconsistent

129
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,850
topology view and this is because the

130
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:24,990
BGP LS propagation happens on bgp best

131
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:28,080
path which does not which is not really

132
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,660
able to determine which LSA or which

133
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,450
information is stale and which one is

134
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,900
the current one so there have been two

135
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,400
options that we'll go over today the

136
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,420
first option is what's currently

137
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:46,829
proposed in the draft that option says

138
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:50,280
that bgp LS producer should withdraw

139
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,350
link state objects associated with nodes

140
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,150
which are determined to be unreachable

141
00:09:52,350 --> 00:10:01,790
in the underlying IDP computation

142
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:03,770
so how this works is that I GP running

143
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,000
on let's take example of our two-year

144
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:10,790
IDP running on r2 as part of its ITP

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,950
processing today marks the LSA zor-el s

146
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:18,170
piece of r4 and r6 as unreachable after

147
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:26,089
running its SPF you know when that when

148
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:30,110
this link fails between our so seeing

149
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:32,870
this picture a zero is in area zero okay

150
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:40,100
it's a wispy of thing yeah and the

151
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:42,410
others are in area one and so in this

152
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,980
case the the proposal is that our to

153
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,709
actually withdraws the BGP LS n lr eyes

154
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,520
corresponding to whatever was originated

155
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:55,130
by r4 + r6 because it's unreachable we

156
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,900
don't know it may be still the nodes may

157
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:04,270
not be there anymore so on and it's the

158
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:09,050
other way for r3 so what are 0 learns

159
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:12,589
from r2 and r3 is really it learns from

160
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:18,349
R to the node objects of R 1 and R 5 and

161
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:21,470
from r3 for r4 and r6 so there is there

162
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,440
won't be any stale and essays or LS

163
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:29,450
piece in the BGP database that is the

164
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,790
bTW pls rip so this allows the BGP RR

165
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,870
and other BGP routers on the propagation

166
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:39,410
path to just follow the BGP best path

167
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:42,170
process now in this picture we have just

168
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,969
the r0 here as a route reflector but

169
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,740
there are different propagation models

170
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,520
some of them which are described in the

171
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,740
draft so when you should generalize this

172
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,990
for a case where the propagation maybe

173
00:11:51,740 --> 00:12:00,680
even happening over a BGP link within a

174
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:05,990
provider network the alternate solution

175
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:09,109
which has been proposed is that the BLS

176
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,940
producer continues to advertise whatever

177
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,690
is in the IG

178
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:17,890
LSD be without any reachability check so

179
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:21,520
everything which is in the LSD be gets

180
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:27,100
advertised out by a BGP LS and in this

181
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:28,780
case to account for this this thing

182
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,290
about still analyzed that we talked

183
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:35,920
about we need to really propagate all

184
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:39,459
the paths or all this NL our eyes

185
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,250
information to the consumer so in this

186
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,420
case the B if there is an RR in this

187
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,860
picture

188
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:51,250
then the RR would have to do ad path so

189
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:55,740
that it doesn't filter out let's say the

190
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:58,810
good NLRA and then if there are other

191
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,300
bgp propagators along the way then they

192
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:05,560
must also do you know something similar

193
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:09,160
to add path they also would need kind of

194
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,420
originator attribute to be carried along

195
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,730
with the BGP LS and NR eyes so if it's a

196
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,550
simple route reflector this thing then

197
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,580
the originator attribute originator ID

198
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,189
attribute would suffice but they are not

199
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:28,380
carried over ebgp so we'll have to you

200
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,380
know maybe think about how to do that

201
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,980
the consumer of the of this field would

202
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,740
get multiple copies of the same and NRI

203
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,460
information and then it it's on the

204
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,880
consumer application controller or a PC

205
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:51,820
or any other thing to actually figure

206
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:53,380
out what's the which ones are really the

207
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,050
fresh ones and which one are the stale

208
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,300
ones so in order to do that what the

209
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,760
consumer would have to do is like an IDP

210
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,800
kind of a processing where for whatever

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,220
to college it receives in this picture

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,199
from r2 and it knows that it is from R 2

213
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,150
because of this originator thing that is

214
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:15,790
carried it has to run its III GPS PF on

215
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:20,230
the topology and then it determines that

216
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:23,770
ok for r2 r4 + r6 were not reachable so

217
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:33,280
no I probably cannot use it

218
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:37,180
similarly I I just don't understand this

219
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:44,170
the person who's a who is originating

220
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:47,859
this in BGP will do this you could you

221
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:52,479
know the API could handle this all

222
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,250
internally you because OSPF are OSPF for

223
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,640
eius eius knows what is and isn't

224
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,450
reachable and and and and so it doesn't

225
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:05,050
it doesn't have to be in the draft right

226
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,750
yeah so it's so that was the first

227
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:14,949
proposal that we discuss where the IDP

228
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:22,090
does that and yeah okay so we will go

229
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:23,920
through yeah which is the bullet that

230
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:27,190
says consumer gets multiple copies of

231
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,349
the same NL RI that that's not unique to

232
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,990
this solution is it like in even on the

233
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,590
previous slide you know a consumer

234
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:37,120
that's consuming from both r2 and r3

235
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,310
could end up would end up getting

236
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,640
multiple copies of the same NL RI isn't

237
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:45,969
it it wouldn't because the r0 would

238
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:49,120
select best path so interpreting

239
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:53,320
suggesting is that if if the consumer is

240
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,900
at location R 0 instead of yes yes yes

241
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,940
in that case it is and it would it would

242
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:02,980
be an implementation aspect on that

243
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:06,280
device how the bgp and the consumer api

244
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,010
is so you are right it it could receive

245
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:12,819
multiple copies or the implementation

246
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:15,100
could run BGP a best path and provide

247
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:20,170
one copy so both things are possible yes

248
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:23,770
it's a it's an implementation aspect so

249
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:26,079
after running so consumer learns the

250
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:30,310
topology from the point of view of r2

251
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,440
and then it runs this IGP SPF to

252
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:35,290
determine which are the valid topology

253
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,580
set from our two point of view similarly

254
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,980
from our three point of

255
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,980
and then these together can be kind of

256
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:47,320
consolidated to get actual topology view

257
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:51,339
of the of the network so this is a

258
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:56,560
comparison that come up with on the pros

259
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:59,920
and cons of the two options so for the

260
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:04,030
solution a the pros are that it we don't

261
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,980
need to change the BGP propagation or

262
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:10,959
the path computation rules we don't need

263
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:15,300
things like add path to be mandated or

264
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:18,640
the new originator ID kind of attribute

265
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:22,510
the pros of the solution B is that it

266
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,699
actually provides a complete LSD B view

267
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,129
to a consumer application so this is

268
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:31,110
something depending on the application

269
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:34,260
this may be something that is required

270
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,669
the cons of the first proposal is that

271
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,820
yeah it doesn't provide the complete

272
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,880
view NL arise for nodes which are

273
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:46,659
unreachable would not be presented in

274
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,200
this case so it may be something that's

275
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,390
ok for controllers or application like

276
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,870
perhaps like a path computation element

277
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:58,510
or a TV topology this thing but for

278
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:01,600
other applications perhaps like a just

279
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:06,910
like a LSD B view kind of a thing that

280
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,010
may not be a good way just to point this

281
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,559
out when you say it needs a path you

282
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:16,030
mean it needs a path and you need to

283
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:23,500
have everything in a yes yes yes so ad

284
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:25,330
path and yeah the cons of the yeah the

285
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,330
cons of the first other another con is

286
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,010
that we have this kind of what I think

287
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,360
what a CEO is trying to talk about we

288
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:37,870
have this kind of a dependency between

289
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:41,800
the IGP SPF computation and the

290
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:45,178
origination of NL arise this is not

291
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,830
something which was clarified in the RFC

292
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:51,170
752

293
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,050
concept the other proposal is this ad

294
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:57,650
path and the originator thing we have to

295
00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:01,639
do that whenever there are scenarios

296
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:04,370
where multiple views there are like most

297
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,210
deployments may have redundant

298
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:12,560
bujji pls originators and in that case

299
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:15,950
this is kind of a requirement

300
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,399
it also requires consumer applications

301
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:22,880
to perform this IGP thing that we talked

302
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,070
about to determine which are the fresh

303
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,310
and a la rise in which one could be the

304
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:31,270
stale as a result of the air paths and

305
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,889
you know route reflectors or ebgp

306
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,870
routers along the path not being able to

307
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,140
run their best path which means we are

308
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:43,760
sending a lot more information in bt pls

309
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:46,310
and kind of caloric corollary of that is

310
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,370
that whenever something changes you know

311
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:52,760
change that is propagated to all the

312
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:56,840
controllers or applications redundant

313
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,120
stuff so we wanted feedback from the

314
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,879
working group on these two solutions and

315
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:11,570
you know how we would like to proceed

316
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:14,150
further you are from we I think the

317
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:17,389
solution is more preferable because we

318
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:20,090
see these variances so the prop eight

319
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:23,030
previous the personal provided a real

320
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:26,300
status of the underlined topology

321
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:29,740
I think the do status of an Arrancar

322
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:35,990
blog is more useful range the complete

323
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:38,000
STP the information look okay you know

324
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,690
from Hawaii patronizing the two

325
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,400
solutions actually defined who will be

326
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,620
responsible for this kind of validation

327
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,710
rather the device should do this or the

328
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,989
consumer will do additional computation

329
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,540
to validate the information collected

330
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:57,290
right so in the I think the post has

331
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,320
pros and cons and also consider of

332
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,389
whether which one I repeat

333
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,879
for the post controller and other

334
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:07,668
devices and we need to collect more

335
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,370
information from our team to get the

336
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:14,870
feedback to you sure yeah we don't have

337
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:17,889
to decide here right now wait chance

338
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,600
cutter it occurred to me that there's

339
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:21,949
one more thing that I'm sure that we

340
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,469
could go on and on with pros and cons

341
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,320
but one thing that may be irrelevant

342
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,950
that I thought of as a con on solution a

343
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,769
is you know in in the example that you

344
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,500
projected there were the right set of

345
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:38,720
feeds to provide you know fresh data

346
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,490
from both sides of the partition so that

347
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,759
the consumer still gets a complete view

348
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,919
of the topology if you imagine that the

349
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,029
consumer is just getting the feed from

350
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,789
let's say the left hand side of the

351
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,649
topology and or you know no matter what

352
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:53,029
you can always construct a partition

353
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:58,189
such that the consumer doesn't get a

354
00:21:53,029 --> 00:22:01,750
feed from the other side of it in in

355
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:04,309
that case solution a you know disappears

356
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:08,149
information about the the unreachable

357
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:10,490
side of the partition solution B leaves

358
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:12,580
that stuff around so the consumer is

359
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,200
able to know oh there was some stuff

360
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:19,789
that was in the topology I can't reach

361
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,200
it now I mean I I think this sort of you

362
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,440
know drive in the same direction as

363
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,860
solution B is essentially more general

364
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,230
in that it exposes the you know as as

365
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:34,189
with as much fidelity as possible the

366
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:35,570
entire LSD be toward the consumer at the

367
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,769
cost that you noted which is that the

368
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,250
consumer has to be a little more

369
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:43,029
sophisticated okay and so we have to ask

370
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,129
ourselves you know are we trying to

371
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,379
tailor this to one particular set use

372
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:50,509
case or set of use cases and does the

373
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:53,600
consumer actually you know need to be

374
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:57,110
able to have that sort of simpler

375
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,959
implementation I I guess the way I'm

376
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,080
presenting my my observation should make

377
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,909
it obvious I kind of prefer solution B

378
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,799
but it's you know it's it's just from a

379
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:13,070
desire to retain generality when

380
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,040
possible I'm not not for it any more

381
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,889
specific than that thank you

382
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,020
yeah so I think that's a very good point

383
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,390
and it depends on the what kind of

384
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,240
consumer application we are looking from

385
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:27,540
point of view so if we look at something

386
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,840
like path computation or a tea engine

387
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:33,540
then the nodes which are unreachable for

388
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,010
it it cannot compute for them or

389
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:40,950
consider them in the topology so for

390
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:44,160
those kinds of applications it does not

391
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,500
matter to have the you know LS DB view

392
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,460
another thing which probably I should

393
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:53,070
point out is that the bt pls topology

394
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,730
view is not like the inventory view of

395
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,870
the topology so I would expect

396
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,270
applications and things who are working

397
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,340
on that that they have like some other

398
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,200
mechanisms to have okay this is my

399
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,230
actual physical topology or this thing

400
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,810
and the BGP LS is only providing let's

401
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:14,190
say like more like the operational state

402
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:16,350
kind of a thing so it also depends on

403
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,890
what the consumer application is

404
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,899
expecting so I agree that it's a lot of

405
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:27,210
things are from the perspective of the

406
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:30,450
application I think just my perspective

407
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:33,090
to this VG pls if you look at it if it

408
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,030
is a topology propagator then it is

409
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:38,429
different from consumer so in that sense

410
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:40,110
consumers job is to really get multiple

411
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,210
copies and figure out what the right

412
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,620
thing to do and BGP a list you know it's

413
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,780
just a propagator of the quality that

414
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:51,149
sense solution B will be more generating

415
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:53,899
mapping sure I mean and just to clarify

416
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:57,210
we don't need to necessarily pick

417
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:59,810
between a and B I mean technically both

418
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,190
could be allowed and stuff like that ya

419
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,870
understand here regarding the fidelity

420
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,760
comment and essentially suppression of

421
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,840
information why are you doing that today

422
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,120
because sequence number is not

423
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,010
propagated so if we really want to say

424
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,570
that we're trying to provide a full view

425
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,860
of the link state database we should be

426
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,389
looking at adding those attributes as

427
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,090
well which then causes an explosion of

428
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:20,040
information data passing processing so I

429
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,629
think from the point of view that it

430
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,540
suppresses data it's a valid argument

431
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,070
but the cost of not suppressing that

432
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,690
data and the computation required in

433
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,279
order to satisfy I

434
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,080
she's making use of it is quite

435
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,970
expensive and I would question for what

436
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,799
right most consumers are looking at

437
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,659
using the GPS data for connectivity

438
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,330
information not necessarily link state

439
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:43,110
database information that's correct I

440
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:46,168
mean I would agree with the angle here

441
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:49,139
and it's important fact to know that we

442
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:52,980
do not have the ability to communicate

443
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:55,758
sequence numbers and an IDP LSD be

444
00:25:52,980 --> 00:26:00,029
without sequence number is kind of like

445
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:05,960
blind in some sense so I think it's

446
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:08,490
thanks and so I fully understand

447
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,250
complexity introduced by solution B I

448
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,860
don't see a justification to do this

449
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,950
compared to a where it's cleanly you

450
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,090
withdraw what you lost and not sure

451
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,549
controller really need to know about

452
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,928
history and there's other elemental

453
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:26,100
information is coming from different

454
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:30,690
places so keep it simple less bugs to be

455
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:33,449
a student of Cisco Systems I agree I

456
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,570
mean less is more you know you you know

457
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,730
give them what's reachable not not

458
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:42,149
that's true topology not what's

459
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:47,519
therefore in a you know another you know

460
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:48,809
it doesn't doesn't timeout for hours

461
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,240
right in an hour

462
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:59,100
anyhow SPF and even longer in is is

463
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:00,659
right so yeah so I think got a sense but

464
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,799
we'll continue this probably the

465
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:08,750
discussion on the email thread and yeah

466
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:11,879
a couple of other things one is on Ayana

467
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:15,210
allocation rules so there has been some

468
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:18,600
discussion on how to do this for bgp LS

469
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:22,169
to make it you know simpler and faster I

470
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,860
think Adrienne has you know posted a

471
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:29,610
draft which tries to cover that so we

472
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:33,029
can see how to incorporate the changes

473
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:35,269
whether in this draft or that we can

474
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:35,269
both

475
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:46,320
okay so the next steps on this is some

476
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,080
editorial fixes based on you know

477
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:54,059
comments received from Adrian and some

478
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:57,289
other folks as well and I would request

479
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:59,760
to give feedback based on your

480
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:03,539
development and deployment experience

481
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,400
and we continue to you know this to this

482
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:08,850
discussion on the list and evolve the

483
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:26,220
craft but we'd like to ask for working

484
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:29,129
group adoption from how I have one more

485
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,710
comment about this update there's a one

486
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,919
saying one change in this increased

487
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:39,690
draft which is maybe inconsistent with

488
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:42,120
the PGP RSVP dropped about the link

489
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,220
local remote identifier in the link

490
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,408
district critters so maybe we need to

491
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,360
take a look about that Alicia could

492
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:52,309
could you share that on the list and

493
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,309
okay we'll try to incorporate Thanks

495
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:20,480
yep good morning everyone

496
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,479
Charlie from Hawaii my topic today is a

497
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,799
past segment in BGP and Mitch Pierre's

498
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:31,429
so basically the motivation is in our SM

499
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:34,190
pairs we have to insert a post segment

500
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,799
to identify as a pass because packet

501
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:41,780
comes to the ingress that egress cannot

502
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:45,710
identify which the post the package

503
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:50,418
belongs to so we propose the amperes per

504
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:54,260
segment in ITF draft spring amperes per

505
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:57,590
segment and it is a ITF working group

506
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:01,129
spring working group item right now so

507
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:05,360
similarly we propose an SME 6po segment

508
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:09,799
in spring working group as well so in

509
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:13,059
that case the in s a v6 the segment list

510
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:16,700
may not be a good key to identified in

511
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:20,899
sv6 pause assailants of the c list is

512
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:24,440
too long and flexible yeah so we create

513
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,220
a new SEC segment called the Savi six

514
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,010
per segment

515
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:33,110
identica identified and Savi six per

516
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:37,520
segment pass so to in order to collect

517
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:39,469
in allocate the pass information per

518
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,250
segment information we need some

519
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:47,510
extensions in BGP and Beach PRS so that

520
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:53,299
is what we have done so the first of all

521
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:55,700
we we update the draft Lea idea as a

522
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:59,090
policy for segments to replace the

523
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:02,350
previous one and coralie idea as a

524
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:06,350
policy postman distribution due to the

525
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:10,189
the the name cuz the name is too long

526
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,500
and is unavailable to upload so the

527
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:16,150
second one is

528
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:20,289
the GPRS extension draft so the main

529
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:23,620
ideas is we create invent we add a new

530
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:25,240
path segments of theory in under the SAC

531
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:31,149
segment leads to sub T of each

532
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:33,940
identifier Inessa path so that is the

533
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,549
format of this TV I will not go into the

534
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:42,250
details of these formats and priests go

535
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:45,280
to review the draft and and also we we

536
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:49,690
create some new sub theory to describe

537
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:52,350
the bi-directional post in BGP first of

538
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,090
all the first one is a bi-directional

539
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:58,000
posit TV and the second one is reverse

540
00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:02,110
post segment list sub theory regarding

541
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,340
the reverse pass segment least sub TV is

542
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:10,719
shared same sub theory which the segment

543
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:15,699
least sub theory yep so the make updates

544
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:19,750
this term is added we add new causes

545
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:23,470
from Jim from China Telecom China

546
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:27,610
Telecom and his 1 and Chen and we also

547
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:31,330
add just the comment from Shara har

548
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:35,439
hatch and and we add ina allocations

549
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:39,340
port and also we add text to specify the

550
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,500
path segments of tier V that can appear

551
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,799
at two level switches which are a

552
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:48,630
candidate cost and segment least so

553
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:51,429
that's what we have done this ITF and

554
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:54,460
let's quick do a quick review of the

555
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:59,169
next draft basically we feel that the

556
00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:03,370
same thing right so that is a format and

557
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:07,720
this is the same for the extension in

558
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:11,199
BGP errors and that is update and next

559
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:15,159
step welcome to review and your comments

560
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,380
are always welcome and by the way we

561
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:20,049
think we are ready for walking through

562
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,640
abduction so we request for working

563
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:23,639
review and adoption

564
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:33,490
any questions if you haven't already

565
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:36,820
sent the adoption call to the mailing

566
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:40,530
list no no yeah okay I will

567
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,530
yep thank you

568

hello Iran I'm too young Ching from Tron

570
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:11,490
telecom my presentation is possum queue

571
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:14,219
in PDP and pprs other we all know in

572
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:16,080
traditional amperes the possum queue can

573
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,449
be a signal that we are signaling

574
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,440
protocols like rsvp-te

575
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:26,669
an RDP Huayra there is no additional

576
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:30,030
signal yet to establish segment routine

577
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:33,659
passes so as a channel cannot currently

578
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:37,260
supports the negotiation mechanism of

579
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,629
the path MTU when seats are inserted

580
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,200
into the packet the packet a rupee

581
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:46,110
dropped in ipv6 or fragmented in 4d

582
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:50,549
since the packet size may exceeds the

583
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:53,040
patent you as Fortran telecom mmm I

584
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:55,380
thought on Telecom when we deploy the

585
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,290
leased line over multiple Minds

586
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:04,020
we usually need to know the path MTU if

587
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:08,100
not if not the car thermal packets size

588
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:11,610
may exceed may exceed the minimum

589
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:16,620
I'm cure among the among the node along

590
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:20,870
the path then it will then the package

591
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:24,060
can be talked all elementadd this record

592
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:28,170
this will cause loss whole prop along

593
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:32,460
thus we propyl the toothbrush the first

594
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:35,730
one a draft true idea be GPRS handsome Q

595
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,790
which twist by the extension through PGP

596
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,840
in state to carry a maximum transform

597
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,220
units

598
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,490
messages a link the second one a draft

599
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,120
the

600
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:51,830
idea I saw Holliston possum q which

601
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:54,620
defines extensions to PDP who

602
00:35:51,830 --> 00:36:00,230
distributes has some new information

603
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:04,049
within as a policies let's have a look

604
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:07,260
the first draft the first graph the

605
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:11,170
draft defines a new sub care way to add

606
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:14,600
to the link attributes stairway which

607
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:22,160
p.m. - it shall be

608
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:25,850
since ft60 326 has defined us Subterra

609
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,940
way to advise the ampulla link in

610
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:32,930
destruct we reused the therapy the

611
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,530
format of the fabric Larrabee is a stone

612
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,859
below

613
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:39,770
whenever there is a change

614
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:43,400
yeah I'm Q value represent represented

615
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:47,290
by link attributes tier V P GPRS should

616
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,580
be reordered in each priority niche the

617
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:53,600
respective share away with the new

618
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:58,210
theory with a new amp you value the in

619
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,100
the controller calculates the path MTU

620
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:04,940
the second draft

621
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:09,799
define a new sub Carraway a new segment

622
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:13,400
lead south carry in as a policy as but a

623
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,670
draft ITF IDR segments routing T policy

624
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,210
defines the SR policy structure as big

625
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:23,030
one

626
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:24,890
each SR pass has a spasm Q so p.m. qtr

627
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,430
away should be in that hitch into the

628
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:34,640
segment list sub Carraway let's have

629
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:37,040
look the format of this cherry Lynch is

630
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,310
the total length of the value field not

631
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,640
including high underlays fields the

632
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:46,220
reserve the fields a 16-piece law and

633
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,930
must be set to zero on transmission and

634
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:54,020
must be ignored unless each person 2 is

635
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:57,549
for bias value of Pithom 2d octaves the

636
00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:00,980
value can be calculated by central

637
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:02,810
controller or other devices basic based

638
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,250
on the information that I learned the

639
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:10,670
via RT p LP DVRs are other means

640
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:13,580
whenever the pass and Q of a physical or

641
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:16,670
logical interface it's changed a new as

642
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:22,930
a policy with new pass and Q information

643
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,930
should be updated accordingly by PGP

644
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:29,220
comments are calm Shaarawy stink up the

645
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:33,830
opossum QT avi format in us our policy

646
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,830
with the one in PDP rise Thank You

647
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:44,910
Justin Sarah who would be the consumer

648
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:48,030
of this information PC controller what

649
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:51,330
why would you distributors who is the

650
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:53,190
consumer of this information consumer

651
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:56,310
who is going to use this information and

652
00:38:53,190 --> 00:39:01,800
for what purposes it should be the

653
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:05,490
controller and the ingress node so we

654
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,350
already distributing MSDS for both SR on

655
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,689
the service six and they're taking the

656
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,549
consideration by PC when they compute a

657
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,440
pass do we need this additional

658
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:17,270
information how it's going to interrupt

659
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,580
this MSD date House PC going to decide

660
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:24,360
compute number of sips versus number of

661
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:27,150
bytes how do you see this working it's

662
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,150
like we have to get the information of

663
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:32,100
this person to you and then we update

664
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:35,910
installed or send information to the

665
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:40,110
ingress such as within the as a policy

666
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:42,529
then I suppose that we walk and we can

667
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,450
discuss this out offline

668
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:47,520
it looks like somewhat redundant given

669
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,859
that MSD data is already there we know

670
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,700
exactly how to form full stack and what

671
00:39:49,860 --> 00:40:01,410
should be in it yeah that would be an

672
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:03,509
option okay don't worry

673
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:06,029
I think Jeff doesn't mention dynasties

674
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,810
for the label status taps right I just

675
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,680
hear the MTU week I'm curious about the

676
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,500
capability of the leading clean the

677
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,049
transit in the intermedia in the notes

678
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:22,530
links network so this is there's

679
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:24,600
different capabilities of the past yeah

680
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:28,580
maybe you need to consider both in when

681
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,319
you encapsulate the papers that the

682
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,509
interruptions and clear and somewhat

683
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,810
complex so if you could address it will

684
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,810
be great

685
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:44,100
jeff has I have two comments for you

686
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:48,180
the first comment first one's more of a

687
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:52,080
question this is a problem for RSVP as

688
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:56,069
well but for links that are linked

689
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:57,750
aggregate groups legs sometimes one of

690
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,850
the problems is that there are miss

691
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,760
provisioning zuv them to you and some of

692
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:05,819
the component like elements do you see

693
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,770
any way in your mechanism so to show

694
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:13,580
that sorry I can't understand

695
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:16,910
I will take my questions mailing list

696
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,910
okay thank you

697
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:40,339
hello good morning present this document

698
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:49,570
this was presented in best as well and

699
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:49,570
we have this ok for a sauna be six plus

700
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,400
this was presented in couple different

701
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:58,160
working groups in this IDF feel free to

702
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,830
look into that presentation for more

703
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,859
details but just giving little bit more

704
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:06,049
details or very brief overview of what a

705
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:07,880
survey 6 plus is all about the one that

706
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,030
is relevant for this particular you know

707
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,820
group is a service Express gives you a

708
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:18,470
unidirectional link path connecting

709
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:20,540
between the two robbers and a survey 6

710
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:23,569
plus also provides you programmable

711
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:27,980
instructions that you can send from the

712
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:29,630
egress into the ingress to to tell what

713
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,390
what they work what the work can be done

714
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:35,320
and also this particular thing

715
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:38,868
completely relies on the ipv6 data plane

716
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,940
on the other hand BGP the old way with

717
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:42,040
all the VPN services has been going

718
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:47,660
through on multiple different tunnels

719
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:49,369
made MPLS IP alley so that so simple

720
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,520
problem statement we all know about this

721
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:57,290
picture the thing that is special in

722
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:59,000
here is the underlay is a 36 + sr b 6 +

723
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,640
introduces like i talked about multiple

724
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,320
types of instructions one that is

725
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,480
relevant here is a for path service

726
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:09,140
instruction EPS I referred in this

727
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,990
document and it's our v6 + puts this

728
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,848
puts this V psi in the destination

729
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,330
options header the second destination

730
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:20,480
options header that should not be v6

731
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:23,710
Datagram header and all the P routers in

732
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,450
the network they do not look into the

733
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:28,900
into this header therefore their P psi

734
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:31,089
unaware and

735
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,540
Pease use these obvious instructions for

736
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:36,280
the basic or can use this be psi

737
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:41,590
information for providing the beeping

738
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:43,210
connectivity so the proposal is let's

739
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:45,510
leverage what we have today which is

740
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:49,360
using the tunnel encapsulation attribute

741
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:52,360
Italian cancellation to signal that you

742
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,130
can establish a tunnel and that means a

743
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,720
service it's plus path is considered

744
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:59,050
like a tunnel between the English in the

745
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,609
egress and the specifics of the tunnel

746
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:04,240
in capitation attribute is listed down

747
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:07,780
here we are requesting a tunnel pipe for

748
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,180
a survey six plus and all sub TLB

749
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,890
specifically the tunnel endpoint

750
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,750
protocol type and color can be used to

751
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,150
influence what gets in into this tunnel

752
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,260
and some of the others appeal ways as

753
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,770
mentioned the tunnel encapsulation

754
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:24,010
document are not needed which is what

755
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:25,630
I've listed down here the special thing

756
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:27,250
is what that online encapsulation

757
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,130
document talks about which is the

758
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,870
embedded label handling sub TLV it only

759
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:34,150
talks about one and two

760
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:36,790
this document introduces the value three

761
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,620
value three is explicitly saying that

762
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:41,020
the ingress when it when it knows that

763
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,580
the encapsulation when it knows the

764
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:46,180
extended label handling value is three

765
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,980
it's so it's so that the we embedded

766
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:51,040
label value that is there which is the p

767
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:54,130
PSI is to be put into the destination

768
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,200
options header right so in other words

769
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,060
the p PSI can be treated like an

770
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,689
embedded label in all the in codings

771
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:05,890
that we have for the IP VPN or the evpn

772
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:09,250
in a lares here is a couple examples the

773
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:11,589
document lists few more and then you

774
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:13,030
know I got feedback you know forgot to

775
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:17,200
remove some statements on the PDMP

776
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:19,060
ignore that in the document but the

777
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,980
encoding is we are going to leverage all

778
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,230
the encoding schemes that we have for

779
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,900
the various NLRs on the LCVP inori VPN

780
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:28,300
just that in the embedded label field

781
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:32,830
you're going to take the three bytes of

782
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,370
the of the P psi P psi is defined as the

783
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,860
32-bit

784
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:38,589
we don't need 32-bit we just need the 24

785
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:42,190
bits and that can be embedded into the

786
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,850
label field for both the various

787
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,400
encoding

788
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:46,630
that we have for bgp from a procedures

789
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,050
perspective

790
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:51,910
let's take aggress egress by psi P psi

791
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,400
is isolated the forwarding table which

792
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:58,720
is the bridges were that is used for D

793
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,980
muxing the s5 level and P psi is encoded

794
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,640
in the embedded label we talked about in

795
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:07,090
the previous slide and along with this

796
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,069
NL RI which is calling this SR b6 + NL

797
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:11,500
RI the tunnel incompletion attribute has

798
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:14,260
to be sent so that you are signalling to

799
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,830
the other remote bgp speaker that you

800
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:21,190
are interpreting this in a survey 6 +

801
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:23,160
inner type on the ingress the P psi is

802
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:25,830
constructed you get the 24 bit and

803
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:29,109
you're going to construct the P psi

804
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,370
actually identify your that is forwarded

805
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,350
that is programmed with the forwarding

806
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,450
table in the S wave to say this is

807
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:37,390
here's my P psi and here the prefix and

808
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:40,210
the nature of data plane is is mentioned

809
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:43,330
in the survey 6 plus document that Ron

810
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:45,160
talked about so it gets into the

811
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:48,370
destination of since header the P

812
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:51,310
routers ignore it and the PE receives it

813
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:54,250
figures out which is the final VPN that

814
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,940
it needs to process the packet to going

815
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:59,680
to the C E and and and thinks about

816
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:03,010
questions comments and then this is

817
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,629
going to be more on the best so not you

818
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:12,340
know request for accepting is not in

819
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:16,930
this any other questions thank you

820
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:22,420
Thanks and just for those of you who

821
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:26,049
weren't in best and you know correct me

822
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:29,320
if I get this wrong but the guidance

823
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:31,180
from the best chairs was first let's see

824
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:35,890
what you know spring wants view with

825
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:38,169
that's our v6 plus and then if spring

826
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:40,299
says great we're gonna work on v6 plus

827
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,860
then they're like yeah this draft is

828
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,290
completely appropriate for best but

829
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,420
they're not gonna proceed with we're

830
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:48,370
group adoption until they they know you

831
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,740
know sort of what spring wants to do

832
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:54,120
with the technology sure that's really

833
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,120
done yeah thank you

834
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,880
yeah

835
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:21,869
hello wait who are you there yes yes

836
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:24,368
give me me yes we hear you yes thank you

837
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:29,640
so good morning everyone today I'm going

838
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:37,450
to present SR pass increased protection

839
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:40,569
next page so subwoofer critical traffic

840
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:46,029
with ham chop and the live traffic may

841
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:50,230
transported by SR pass for example so we

842
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:53,349
may have SR cast from a bank to New York

843
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:57,609
Stock Exchange and then this SR path

844
00:48:53,349 --> 00:49:01,750
will be used to sender request for

845
00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:05,348
buying or selling stock so when we use

846
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:08,260
the as a pass to connect operational

847
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:11,619
room and the doctor's office for support

848
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:15,369
remove the surgery and so on as we can

849
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:19,900
see we need a protection for this area's

850
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:23,500
past if this SR pass get broken we can

851
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:32,859
see that we make it have a big loss so

852
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:35,560
next page we have a te aerospace 40

853
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:39,730
years piece we have end-to-end advanced

854
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:42,310
protections for example we have a TLP

855
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:45,849
increased fast production already have

856
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:50,770
RFC's we have a midpoint protection for

857
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:54,849
tlvs we have our sleeve of 40:19 we also

858
00:49:50,770 --> 00:50:00,339
have fast protections for each result of

859
00:49:54,849 --> 00:50:03,609
geographies however for SR pass we only

860
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:06,790
have a few individual drafts these

861
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:09,549
drafts propose some solutions for me the

862
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:11,619
pro in fast production and the equals

863
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:16,329
for faster production for a therapist

864
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:19,660
we don't have fast production for SR

865
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:22,810
pass English note so that I think there

866
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:25,368
is a need or requirement for provide

867
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:31,640
faster productions for SA pass

868
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:35,989
English note next page great now

869
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:40,700
PCPD has already descended for support

870
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:41,599
as a passport Ana setup we have a pgps

871
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,828
our policies

872
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:49,640
so using this PTP extension we can send

873
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:51,559
information to English lot of essa past

874
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,890
so with this information

875
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:58,940
English note can set up as as a possible

876
00:50:54,890 --> 00:51:03,140
kana so is Rachel and a very easy to

877
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,599
extend PPE to allow PCC student

878
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,299
information to pack - English - note and

879
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,400
then with this information by cab

880
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:13,670
impersonal can set up a bike hub as well

881
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:17,839
as a pass so as well as a limited

882
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:21,079
resource affairs we can very quickly to

883
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:24,469
import traffic into the backup as a pass

884
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:28,130
so in this way we can provide a fast

885
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:30,499
production for failure of English note

886
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:34,489
so with this parts production will give

887
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:36,799
us a lot plus those proposals for me the

888
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:40,670
point of fact partisan and equal of

889
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:45,650
equal richness partition we have fast

890
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:48,019
and to end SF has protections so what

891
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:50,839
kind of information do we need under pi

892
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:53,718
Kappa in casinos to set up a bike a pass

893
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:56,930
to provide a stop protections for

894
00:51:53,719 --> 00:52:02,690
primary ingress note next page will

895
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:05,239
provide those emissions next page so you

896
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:08,359
wanted to set have a backup pass to

897
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:12,079
provide protection for English note so

898
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:14,690
we need those disinformation first we

899
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:18,019
need the information for pi cabassa

900
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:22,430
as a pass we may need an information for

901
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:25,430
primary use note in addition we may need

902
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:29,140
information for the surface which is

903
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:33,169
transport transported by the SR pass

904
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:35,029
with furthermore we may need the

905
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:37,700
description of traffic which is

906
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:39,710
transported by the as a pass

907
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:43,390
for some of this information we can

908
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:46,819
encode in we can reuse the SR policy

909
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:51,410
well we just need a very small changes

910
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:53,180
to existing si policies to just like

911
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:58,549
encoding all these informations next

912
00:52:53,180 --> 00:53:02,359
page so right now we have a as a policy

913
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:05,450
signature so we just needed to have a

914
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:12,470
small extensions to existing as a policy

915
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:14,770
encoding so here we just define Elsa

916
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:17,450
past or tunnel ingress protection

917
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:21,319
opportunities so all the other

918
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:24,919
information is existing is insidious our

919
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:29,540
policy so the extinction in strange

920
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,809
Angela we here is in blue color which is

921
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:35,359
mainly the esta tunnel ingress

922
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:39,140
protagonist of chopper TV so under this

923
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:43,339
activity we have a couple of sapaterre

924
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:46,400
of these such as primary interest soffit

925
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:52,130
LV and the service staff at LV so next

926
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:55,609
page so for El Cercado increase

927
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:58,220
protections dr. P so we have a flag so

928
00:53:55,609 --> 00:54:04,190
this planet has indicated whether well

929
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:06,680
let the forwarding entry for by cap as a

930
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:11,000
path whether is active or inactive

931
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:15,618
better indication so in this activity we

932
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,109
may have a couple of optional sapaterre

933
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:22,339
of these so this optional sub will be

934
00:54:18,109 --> 00:54:27,319
may include primary English note address

935
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:29,420
and the surface ID or status labels so

936
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:35,170
we're look those of sapaterre these next

937
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:39,559
page so enquiries a primary aggressor IP

938
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:42,530
v4 or ipv6 address secretaries

939
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:46,520
so they establish a V just contain

940
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:50,750
either the ipv4 address over the primary

941
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:53,500
he was not or ipv6

942
00:54:50,750 --> 00:55:00,050
IP address of the primary English note

943
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:02,810
so next page so another set of subtly is

944
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:06,020
a surface surface of sub TV because we

945
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:08,570
know SFA's may carry some surface so

946
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:13,730
this surface will be identified by a

947
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:18,440
surface ID or several labels so we here

948
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:22,150
we have Sabadell the service the labels

949
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:25,099
a priori which it contains 20-piece

950
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:28,070
labels which is which is used to

951
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:34,730
identify a surface which is carried by

952
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:36,680
as a pass so another surface ID surface

953
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:42,130
may be identified last by service IDs

954
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:51,020
which may be served to Pete's society or

955
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:54,080
128-bits surface IDs yeah language here

956
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:57,470
I think that's all about the SSR

957
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:00,259
extension as pp extension for support as

958
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:02,919
on equal protections so any comments and

959
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,920
suggestions

960
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:15,900
anybody not okay thank you very much

961
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:30,520
so any forces can come over here wait we

962
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,860
will we did not have any questions and

963
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,640
over thank you so much for the

964
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,640
presentation

965
00:56:51,119 --> 00:57:00,900
as soon as we find your slides Jeff your

966
00:56:53,400 --> 00:57:04,440
offer yes you did submit them let's say

967
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:11,369
it's a PowerPoint PDF impedance mismatch

968
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:11,940
so if you want to start talking I can

969
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:14,819
get started

970
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:19,499
so I'm Jeff has I'm here presenting for

971
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:23,180
some of my colleagues ruffle and company

972
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:26,430
and what we're going to see here is a

973
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:29,839
relatively trivial mechanism for passing

974
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:33,569
along colored labeled routes using BGP

975
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:35,700
the use case is with all of this fun

976
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:39,329
srte stuff that we've been doing over

977
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:42,689
the past several years we have some

978
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:45,869
beads to pass around information in a

979
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:49,259
very simple mechanism to reach from one

980
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:52,410
PE to another PE in an inter domain

981
00:57:49,259 --> 00:57:53,940
fashion and clearly we have all sorts of

982
00:57:52,410 --> 00:58:00,299
mechanisms that then going around that

983
00:57:53,940 --> 00:58:03,420
work great for na s we have as examples

984
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:05,640
know each POS being used we have cases

985
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,819
where people are doing pieces up it

986
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,710
should be policy srte

987
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:12,989
but the inter-domain case is a little

988
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,089
messy and this is the point where that's

989
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:17,579
late for stuff as I mentioned this is on

990
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:18,989
behalf of Lois and I raffle next slide

991
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:21,390
please

992
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:23,729
so again like I said the the big big

993
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:28,049
thing here is we're trying to provide a

994
00:58:23,729 --> 00:58:31,129
tool for end-to-end transport for stuff

995
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:31,130
next slide please

996
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:44,219
so as we all know 4s are no te type

997
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:47,339
applications no colors the way we tend

998
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:50,339
to refer to things so you know SRT he

999
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:53,640
route does need inter domain treatment

1000
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:56,219
as well obviously the intradomain

1001
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,509
aspects are covered by a ton of draft so

1002
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:01,619
I'm not going to spend any time in the

1003
00:58:57,509 --> 00:59:03,859
slide deck disk discussing this next

1004
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:03,859
slide please

1005
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:16,368
and as the Craig slide in has been

1006
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:35,359
mangled would you flow the PowerPoint

1007
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:36,890
please this is PowerPoint presenting on

1008
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:39,200
you know whatever they have on these

1009
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:44,118
Chromebooks okay I can quickly generate

1010
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:46,819
up a PDF I I will submit it at later

1011
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:48,410
update for everybody to look at the

1012
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,890
information then there's not terribly

1013
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:53,450
interesting let's go back to full screen

1014
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:56,240
the the diagram in question that we're

1015
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:58,580
missing is just simply a network that

1016
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,819
shows a inter domain component on the

1017
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:03,319
right hand side where you have reflector

1018
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,770
in the middle and you're exercising

1019
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,720
normal srte type into mechanisms we have

1020
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:11,750
colored routes and we pass it to an a s

1021
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,490
on the left hand side at the a s border

1022
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,800
you know we were passing around you know

1023
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:17,299
the new labeled colored route label

1024
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,310
color unicast is what we're doing here

1025
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:35,660
next slide and again this is not

1026
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:37,940
terribly interesting at first I use the

1027
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,740
new submission tool and usually it can

1028
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:43,460
auto converts on its own and it didn't

1029
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:47,450
do bail something for the tools team

1030
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:52,099
next time so the format that we chose

1031
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:55,848
Falls the 3107 this draft became RFC

1032
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:58,280
very recently it's 8277 you know PHP

1033
01:00:55,849 --> 01:01:00,530
labeled unicast very boring you normally

1034
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,530
have you know prefix which has labels at

1035
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:05,869
the top and the actual prefix at the

1036
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:08,930
bottom use this for all sorts of BGP

1037
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:11,960
things right now the thing that's

1038
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:14,080
changed is that we're going to next

1039
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,080
slide

1040
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:33,050
hi Jeff it's Adrian while we wait did I

1041
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:35,600
catch you saying that the the agreement

1042
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:38,390
of the colors between the domains had to

1043
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,710
be made how about we get to that in a

1044
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:43,160
second ah good question

1045
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:44,540
damn I was trying to you know excellent

1046
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,290
question it's in the cell know something

1047
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:49,940
say well I will save the entire room by

1048
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:52,870
avoiding singing may singing voice you

1049
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,870
know you heard outside the shower

1050
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:02,120
please don't request response another

1051
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:07,160
question I see the metal slicing is

1052
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:10,430
imagine Dean while the page yeah yeah

1053
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:13,069
yeah it also can completely ignore the

1054
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:15,620
fact that the pure business thing should

1055
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:18,730
be gone it's just the PowerPoint

1056
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:20,990
templates I apologize for that so at the

1057
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:23,120
like said this is very simple proposal

1058
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:25,339
labelled color unicast we're just simply

1059
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,859
adding in a color along with the labels

1060
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:30,020
now the position of the color is there

1061
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:32,720
to allow us to do things like wild card

1062
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:36,980
on color which is a application for some

1063
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:38,720
people's SR networks the color value is

1064
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:40,670
sky color value zero has been reserved

1065
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,250
as you'll see in the draft the draft is

1066
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:44,720
very heavy on use case and we realize

1067
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,160
the use cases will probably need to be

1068
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,080
trimmed down after working group

1069
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,490
adoption but the whole idea is to get

1070
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,350
people socialized with some of the

1071
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:53,270
things that drove us to talk about this

1072
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:55,790
the one thing that's a little bit on the

1073
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:58,550
interesting side is since this is

1074
01:02:55,790 --> 01:03:01,220
covering s are cases we realized

1075
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:03,770
especially with ipv6 no destinations

1076
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:06,410
that the number of labels would probably

1077
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:08,150
outgrow the size of a single peach BL or

1078
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:10,069
I you know with the standard one byte

1079
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:13,220
encoding so the only other thing that's

1080
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:15,140
a interesting change in here is that we

1081
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:17,450
offer the flexible one or two bytes

1082
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,370
length encoding that we use for b2b

1083
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:22,160
flowspec now those procedures are well

1084
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:23,690
documented and gives us the ility to put

1085
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:28,149
on more since no on the stack if

1086
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:28,150
necessary next slide please

1087
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:46,650
so attribute considerations no so the

1088
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,420
remote next hop no this is what you

1089
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:50,819
would use for the service routes that

1090
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,470
resolve over these things obviously you

1091
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:55,049
match this based on a color community

1092
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:56,609
just like they do for other SR purposes

1093
01:03:55,049 --> 01:03:59,249
we're not changing that this is not

1094
01:03:56,609 --> 01:04:00,808
interesting color extended community is

1095
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:03,299
the way we typically do this we're

1096
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:04,980
generally recommending exactly one one

1097
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:06,690
of the issues that we think needs to be

1098
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,749
brought up to best as a general Lynch

1099
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:11,640
general item this a lot of these magic

1100
01:04:09,749 --> 01:04:14,189
communities are not really well defined

1101
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,180
when they're multi instanced so now

1102
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:18,210
we're trying to clarify that in the

1103
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,720
draft for our specific no else you

1104
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,460
trout's

1105
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:24,390
first thing the tunnel and capture a

1106
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:26,789
tribute should not be carried to e being

1107
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:28,019
the plumbing of favor of the day we

1108
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:29,279
suspect this may all eventually come up

1109
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:30,720
with something that they want to put in

1110
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:32,910
there anyway but this is what we're

1111
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,220
saying today and in cases where you

1112
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:37,529
actually want to utilize this along with

1113
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:40,669
prefix id's that is actually allowed

1114
01:04:37,529 --> 01:04:40,670
next slide please

1115
01:04:53,110 --> 01:05:02,210
so okay back up slightly please there we

1116
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,160
go

1117
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:05,210
so a question that we've received and

1118
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,379
this was actually part of our

1119
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,820
discussions when we were trying to

1120
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:10,450
figure out what our favorite encoding

1121
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:12,350
should be as we know we're not the IETF

1122
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:14,120
encoding spends that you know a lot of

1123
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:15,710
our discussion time but really the

1124
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,500
functional thinking is what we really

1125
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:21,020
should be discussing know so why not the

1126
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,970
existing tunnel of caps encoding you

1127
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:24,920
know that actually carries endpoints it

1128
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:27,410
carries colors and the cable stacks know

1129
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,200
we can do everything in here the problem

1130
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:31,310
that we have is that in terms of BGP

1131
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,839
propagation characteristics and how we

1132
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:37,160
want this stuff to behave that an inner

1133
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:39,020
domain basis then Ori key really needs

1134
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,940
something that disambiguate multi

1135
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,050
instances of this and since the thing

1136
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:44,090
we're trying to carry around and

1137
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:45,500
distinguish really is just color we

1138
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:47,590
wanted to make this part of the key and

1139
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,400
once you've done that you've taken away

1140
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:51,620
significant portion of the motivation

1141
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,180
for the tunnel and caps attribute now of

1142
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,100
course we could do other things to get

1143
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:57,830
that diversity and there couldn't have a

1144
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,540
roughest Englisher could be ad paths the

1145
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:02,720
problem is we want something that gets

1146
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:05,210
carried in true domain so we end up in

1147
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,600
this big resolution and of course we're

1148
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:10,520
not particularly set on any specific

1149
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:13,160
encoding we just happen to think that

1150
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,720
for the use cases we're discussing this

1151
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,670
probably makes it that sense we're happy

1152
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,759
to take discussion on this next slide

1153
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,760
please

1154
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:23,720
and again this is you know domain

1155
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,089
independent you know this can be using

1156
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,339
for any know tunneling technology at the

1157
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:30,530
other side could be srte RSVP you know

1158
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:32,390
etc etc as long as we actually can carry

1159
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:35,330
the intent over there and express in the

1160
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:38,000
color and you know it resembles MPLS you

1161
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:41,720
know LCU encoding works perfectly fine

1162
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,060
and this is BGP this means that as it

1163
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:46,069
crosses domains operators get to be in

1164
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:48,460
full control of what they actually do

1165
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:53,140
next slide

1166
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:56,180
so it was Adrian actually managed to

1167
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:59,029
bring up a question early on what do we

1168
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:03,259
do about color conflicts the current

1169
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:05,900
proposal does actually presuppose that

1170
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:09,079
we're going to have the set of provider

1171
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:11,809
that are using this technology agreeing

1172
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:13,579
on a color across things this was the

1173
01:07:11,809 --> 01:07:15,799
most contentious bit of our internal

1174
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:20,210
discussion and with the people that are

1175
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:22,849
very much lacking operational the

1176
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:24,980
exposure fact that the operators can't

1177
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:26,390
agree on you know the value of one no

1178
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:32,210
first officially small values of one

1179
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:36,799
sometimes and part of the discussion

1180
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:39,020
here was what do we do if ATF decides

1181
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:41,869
that you know we can't agree on these

1182
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:44,660
things this does it probably involve

1183
01:07:41,869 --> 01:07:46,970
some sort of middle layer we have

1184
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:49,879
actually had a discussion that really

1185
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:52,640
color in an intra domain basis becomes a

1186
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,079
namespacing issue everybody internally

1187
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,839
is going to have their own color

1188
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,549
namespacing the question is can you

1189
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:00,078
carve out a space that you all can agree

1190
01:07:58,549 --> 01:08:02,349
on for the things that you really care

1191
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:05,150
about being aired main idea being that

1192
01:08:02,349 --> 01:08:06,740
for multi ASU tend to have two

1193
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:08,930
deployments right now to define

1194
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:10,609
strategies the first one is it's really

1195
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:12,710
the same organization with multiple

1196
01:08:10,609 --> 01:08:14,390
asses and therefore they can come to

1197
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:16,549
some sort of agreement the other one

1198
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:19,339
being actual separate providers where

1199
01:08:16,549 --> 01:08:20,509
the coordination does not exist one of

1200
01:08:19,339 --> 01:08:23,238
the things we can do about that

1201
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:25,130
potentially long term now as I mentioned

1202
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:26,899
you know we have options to put some

1203
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:29,750
sort of disambiguating thing on there

1204
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:31,399
and that disambiguation whether it's a

1205
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,810
route distinguisher a domain

1206
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,099
distinguisher to pick whatever name you

1207
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:36,980
actually want to assign to the thing

1208
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:39,920
allows us to potentially namespace the

1209
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:41,358
intradomain version of this color so the

1210
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,779
inter domain red that you agree on

1211
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:47,839
across three asses may locally map to

1212
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:50,210
your red your blue your green internally

1213
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:52,908
and we did have had discussions about we

1214
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,469
could do these sorts of things but the

1215
01:08:52,908 --> 01:08:56,179
thing I pushed them to do for the first

1216
01:08:54,469 --> 01:08:58,880
version of the dis draft is let's start

1217
01:08:56,179 --> 01:09:00,830
with the simple case and see know who

1218
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,060
stands up in the mic and says well you

1219
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:04,600
haven't thought about this well we did

1220
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:06,679
think about this let's start with simple

1221
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:12,140
convince this otherwise we do have a

1222
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:15,259
back-up plan but now in terms of part of

1223
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:16,790
our headache here is scaling the

1224
01:09:15,259 --> 01:09:18,350
motivation for this at least one of the

1225
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:19,429
easy motivations for the inner domain

1226
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:21,920
case is

1227
01:09:19,429 --> 01:09:24,049
slicing you know the ecology that we

1228
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,939
failed to bring up that's going to

1229
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:29,328
involve potentially the case with you're

1230
01:09:25,939 --> 01:09:32,029
trying to provide endpoints for tens of

1231
01:09:29,328 --> 01:09:35,058
thousands of you know endpoints in your

1232
01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:37,609
system and when you start scaling that

1233
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:38,959
out with no stacks for each of them you

1234
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:41,299
know four never exciting especially

1235
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:43,908
using SR if you're not providing

1236
01:09:41,299 --> 01:09:46,069
aggregation of some sort the cross

1237
01:09:43,908 --> 01:09:47,658
product of your endpoints versus the

1238
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:51,619
colors you're providing these things for

1239
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:53,868
can potentially be huge so that I think

1240
01:09:51,618 --> 01:09:56,199
also will motivate the question of what

1241
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:59,209
we do about name spacing so again

1242
01:09:56,199 --> 01:10:04,039
summary we're trying to provide a simple

1243
01:09:59,209 --> 01:10:06,110
mechanism very similar to 3107 8277 for

1244
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:08,539
inter AAS carrying of colored labeled

1245
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:10,959
routes we know that there are some

1246
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:13,459
considerations in terms of agreement and

1247
01:10:10,959 --> 01:10:15,170
options that we can do if that ends up

1248
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:18,909
not being a good generalized solution

1249
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:24,409
and passed that point we're looking for

1250
01:10:18,909 --> 01:10:27,079
discussion in potentially adoption yeah

1251
01:10:24,409 --> 01:10:29,799
a transparent again so I I'm glad you've

1252
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:32,420
recognized it's a hard problem I'm not

1253
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:37,400
quite sure that you've recognized how

1254
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:39,739
hard it is I hate to do the the we've

1255
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:42,860
been here before that we we have tried

1256
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:47,199
this several times before once at least

1257
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:49,549
was MPLS traffic engineering mm-hm

1258
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:52,219
I'm sure you've got people within your

1259
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:55,400
own organization who were there at that

1260
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:58,639
time and can share with you I'm happy to

1261
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,949
chat offline about quite how difficult

1262
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:03,469
this is it's a it's not just a name

1263
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:08,388
space thing it's a policy problem

1264
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:12,769
absolutely it it's sort of order of n

1265
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:16,789
factorial it ends up being certainly the

1266
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:18,530
power of one way to look at it since

1267
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:21,650
these things are intended to be passed

1268
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:24,199
along inter-domain top I have one of the

1269
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:26,030
things that this is a read between the

1270
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:29,320
lines and the current draft in terms of

1271
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:31,759
the recursive resolution properties and

1272
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,049
since you some since we have actually

1273
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,820
gotten challenged we need

1274
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:36,700
actually talk about this you know this

1275
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:39,740
is a 13 group decides that there they go

1276
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:41,840
the general idea is that when you're

1277
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:43,370
passing around the sort of abstracted

1278
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,370
versions of the color that you're using

1279
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:48,680
for inter-domain purposes and a hot

1280
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,110
basis you can use a attached color

1281
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:54,470
community to help you locally resolve

1282
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:56,870
you know inter-domain red to local blue

1283
01:11:54,470 --> 01:12:02,120
and those colors can be reset on in bas

1284
01:11:56,870 --> 01:12:04,400
PRS and that works for sort of like the

1285
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:06,410
one dimension but then there are

1286
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,019
multiple inter-domain Reds because each

1287
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:11,570
commercial relationship between the

1288
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:13,220
multiple operators it will have

1289
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:15,790
different definitions of inter-domain

1290
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:17,060
red and so you need like a double

1291
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,980
indirection

1292
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:21,650
somebody tried a business model for this

1293
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:23,839
at one point being a broker of this and

1294
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:25,759
and they've burnt some money and then

1295
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,110
went away yeah unfortunately this stuff

1296
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,120
eventually starts smelling like Route

1297
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:30,380
distinguishers you know and that's the

1298
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,820
encoding that that we've discussed it's

1299
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:39,290
really been medicine work online on my

1300
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:40,969
points similar trade routes yeah it's a

1301
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:43,910
fairy tale that you could just agree on

1302
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:48,350
bodies do I remember correctly that the

1303
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:51,280
actual namespace size is 30 bits do -

1304
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:54,770
yes so this will start to feel fairly

1305
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:58,550
similar can I suggest that we ask

1306
01:12:54,770 --> 01:13:01,850
someone to write large colors absolutely

1307
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:03,260
in action because if we're going to try

1308
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:04,970
and use some sort of intermediate

1309
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:07,550
mapping that only exists in the kind of

1310
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:09,920
no-man's land between two assets those

1311
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:13,010
are likely to be names based on the

1312
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,020
basis of an AAS and immediately we run

1313
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:17,390
into a namespace size problem so my

1314
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,560
admirer you know my terminal hunch

1315
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:19,100
colors is kind of telling it

1316
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,650
tongue-in-cheek

1317
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:24,050
but it's almost exactly the same problem

1318
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:25,940
as standard communities absolutely then

1319
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:28,550
you're Adrian did bring it up correctly

1320
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:31,309
so no it does name just pairs of a s is

1321
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:34,220
this made nobody sets of a asses and the

1322
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:35,930
sets of a asses may be different

1323
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:36,560
depending on context and therefore you

1324
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,560
end up with all these different

1325
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,140
disjoints ideas of what things mean no

1326
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,570
Redmayne e maybe means for federation

1327
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:46,250
set a and federation said be completely

1328
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,989
different things

1329
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:50,150
you just need a way to disambiguate them

1330
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:52,910
the question sort of comes back in terms

1331
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:55,519
of encoding you simply make a very very

1332
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:58,849
large global value so do we move from 32

1333
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,230
to 128 bits and assume that for all the

1334
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:02,239
disjoint sets we can come to some of our

1335
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:04,759
agreement out of that my guess is

1336
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:06,559
probably not and I think this probably

1337
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,600
pushes us more to something looks like a

1338
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,440
route distinguisher in terms of you're

1339
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:15,080
able to set up for Federation a

1340
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:16,549
namespace one red means this and that

1341
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:20,059
you can disambiguate it with something

1342
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:25,130
that actually has a global allocation

1343
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:27,650
mapping yes I think probably the kind of

1344
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:30,920
a pairwise approaches it's gonna be the

1345
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:33,379
best one I think in so I've done kind of

1346
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,540
the the equivalent exercise to negotiate

1347
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:39,920
mappings for traffic classes and kind of

1348
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:42,170
you know option BNC VPNs usually what

1349
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,330
that boils down to in that context is

1350
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:45,920
someone gets to kind of own the

1351
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:47,510
namespace and the other person is

1352
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,360
responsible for mapping in and out of it

1353
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:52,130
that is that's a hassle for the person

1354
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,900
that has to do the mapping right so I

1355
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:56,150
think in this case if we want to avoid

1356
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:58,309
that problem what you want is a large

1357
01:14:56,150 --> 01:15:01,219
enough main namespace that you have a

1358
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:01,820
namespace perp here you know so in the

1359
01:15:01,219 --> 01:15:05,300
context

1360
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:07,969
so take given given a s1 and a s2 are

1361
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:12,380
inter connecting they want a unique

1362
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:14,840
namespace to identify the the mappings

1363
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:16,580
that exist on that adjacency so is it /

1364
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:20,570
adjacent so you talking about / a s

1365
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:23,540
there Jason C / s topology graph

1366
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:27,949
adjacency they may usually appear on the

1367
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:28,640
in the business sense not the yes yes

1368
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:30,710
exactly

1369
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,960
right and again I believe this actually

1370
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:34,310
extends to this set of a s as they may

1371
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,739
be participating because if you have a s

1372
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:41,199
is 1 2 3 in a chain that need to have

1373
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:43,639
this agreement as well

1374
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,080
yeah probably from a protocol

1375
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,870
perspective that's rare that that

1376
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:50,710
matters from a actual engineering

1377
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:53,059
perspective because probably those two

1378
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:55,179
those two links in that chain on

1379
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:59,660
actually being stood up at the same time

1380
01:15:55,179 --> 01:16:00,060
and from a practical perspective you're

1381
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,230
needing

1382
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,060
to deal with needing to abstract the

1383
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:05,910
details the one from the other

1384
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:08,880
anyway right and I think where the but

1385
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:10,980
you know the suggested encoding and

1386
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,170
easing a distinguishers sort of nice is

1387
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:15,240
it gives you a just like for a route

1388
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:17,250
targets you have to pick somebody is a s

1389
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,840
to be the no crew to the namespace and

1390
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:20,880
then pass that you can know a namespace

1391
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,820
out of that this allows you to map all

1392
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:26,460
the functional equivalence classes for

1393
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:29,730
the different it's no agreed-upon color

1394
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,380
into one place and the fact that you

1395
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:33,059
know I think may be different than some

1396
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,920
of the other proposals I'm a little

1397
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,750
rusty on some of my historical reading

1398
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,580
the fact that these things can

1399
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:41,460
recursively resolve and a half I have

1400
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:43,260
basis and the ASPRS you know via color

1401
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:45,210
community to their local tables

1402
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:47,160
I think solves at least some of the

1403
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,960
older problems in the sense that you

1404
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,059
don't have to worry about what does this

1405
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,600
mean and have this giant translation

1406
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:56,310
table your standard beach be no

1407
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:58,590
community policy applied that the SPRs

1408
01:16:56,310 --> 01:17:01,490
can do most of your how to map from the

1409
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:09,360
intradomain version to this domains

1410
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:11,580
equivalent of it yeah most of what I was

1411
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,679
gonna say what has already been said I

1412
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:15,480
not terribly operationally experienced

1413
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,910
but I would believe most people will do

1414
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,759
this mapping at the boundary anyway and

1415
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:25,700
I rather have a good way to make that

1416
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:25,700
work than try and do the generic thing

1417
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,469
happens in to Nokia um Jeff I guess one

1418
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:33,450
of the things that occurs to me and this

1419
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:35,070
is likely what's gonna happen if people

1420
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:37,530
are using us our policies for the

1421
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:39,599
slicing I likely to use binding sits at

1422
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:40,769
the boundaries and to some degree I

1423
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,380
think that helped us a little bit

1424
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:45,030
doesn't it because when we we enter into

1425
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,710
a binding said the binding of the

1426
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:49,259
traffic isn't based on color anymore

1427
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:51,930
it's based on the label so I would think

1428
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:54,870
that that actually does give you a bit

1429
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:56,340
of a decoupling mechanism a little bit

1430
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:59,550
but it comes sort of an ad path type

1431
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:01,500
problem you know so if you have in the

1432
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:03,120
technology to fill the show a red path

1433
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:05,250
across the top and the blue path across

1434
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:08,519
the bottom that's inner domain to the

1435
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:10,140
same endpoint yeah at the endpoint at

1436
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:12,060
Vegas there's something that you're pure

1437
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,019
transit in the middle I mean in theory

1438
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,550
he wouldn't necessarily

1439
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:16,889
to normalize to the colors at the

1440
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:19,380
endpoint he could he could normalize to

1441
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:21,360
a different set of transport schemes and

1442
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:23,699
offer boxes anyway just a thought with

1443
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,710
it it's the usual mapping problem and

1444
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:29,699
you actually expose snow for the same

1445
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:31,260
actual endpoint more than one address or

1446
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:32,699
do you provide different label stacks

1447
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:36,659
the trouble is if we look at something

1448
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:39,089
in terms of a HB link labeled unicast

1449
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:40,619
type encoding the labels themselves are

1450
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:42,780
not a key so that doesn't help you

1451
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:45,179
inter-domain so you need one additional

1452
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:47,039
thing people think colors for these

1453
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:50,159
types of things for slices anyway at

1454
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,360
least in that context and for the

1455
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,879
important thing is this is just an

1456
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,820
encoding color is a common scheme that

1457
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:59,300
makes SR people happy and TE people

1458
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:01,380
happy it's effectively just a

1459
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:03,719
distinguished route distinguisher that

1460
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:05,840
you can use your path with policy that's

1461
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,840
it

1462
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:11,340
thanks for the questions we heard

1463
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,710
partially what we were expecting that

1464
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:14,460
the simplified version was probably too

1465
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:17,400
simple

1466
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:19,650
our likely next step is to bring back

1467
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:22,110
the next version of the draft the things

1468
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:26,659
that we had discussed in there and then

1469
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:26,659
after that look for adoption thank you

1470
01:19:54,980 --> 01:20:04,169
okay however I think I'm the last

1471
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:06,300
presentation and for today's Emily Lake

1472
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:10,890
it comes from Maui okay so this

1473
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:12,390
presentation is for bgp requestor for to

1474
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,040
control her to lat

1475
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:17,870
the controller advertise candidate the

1476
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:20,970
pass for energy policy so this is the

1477
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:25,010
presentation is title and before I

1478
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:28,560
introduce the detail about the protocol

1479
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:30,540
encoding and so on masta to introduce

1480
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:35,220
the let's talk about the motivation

1481
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:38,340
about this topic first in the left of

1482
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:41,910
the slides we can see and they had under

1483
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:46,200
they as a policy and can be informed by

1484
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:49,260
the variants including CRI not calm

1485
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,800
peace app or BGP from the controller to

1486
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:52,380
Caturday

1487
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,960
as a policy and the candidate pass they

1488
01:20:52,380 --> 01:21:00,300
so defined in the springs draft ice

1489
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:02,370
apology considerations so but when we

1490
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:06,480
can get all this information from

1491
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:08,220
controller sure we can get all the ice

1492
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,629
our policy tunnel science our policy

1493
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:11,730
entries from the controller at the

1494
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:14,640
beginning of the may being created and

1495
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:18,299
initialed but it's not so friendly for

1496
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:22,580
the small boxes in our network that

1497
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:25,700
means if we can have a trigger method

1498
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:29,670
trigger mechanism for the head of

1499
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:33,090
ingress of the VPN or they can had and

1500
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:38,280
of the PE and to get the policy under

1501
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:41,220
the pass from the controller on the

1502
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:44,580
mound is better for the small boxes of

1503
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:48,690
our in our network so in some situations

1504
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:50,940
had and may want to pull one or a set of

1505
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:53,730
Canada the pass from the controller or

1506
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:55,440
PCE rather than just attach all this

1507
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:57,059
information at the beginning of the

1508
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:01,200
opinion issued

1509
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:03,900
so if we we can open up this protocol

1510
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:08,340
has defined the request and the reply

1511
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:10,980
messages in RFC 5 4 0 to match this

1512
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:15,090
requirement that means they can we can

1513
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:17,190
ask PCE to give them the as list all

1514
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:19,410
candy they pass all day anything else

1515
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:22,219
from the controller when they want but

1516
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:24,660
I'm also to say we use PDP from

1517
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:28,320
controller together as our policy and

1518
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:30,300
Canada pass bit but BG's piece update

1519
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:34,700
message or some other add messages

1520
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:37,890
cannot to request this one so all this

1521
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:41,670
document I defined adjusted to find a

1522
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:44,370
mechanism for BGP to similar with

1523
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:46,110
percept you got a request from the

1524
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:48,840
controller together the candidate pass

1525
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:51,690
to get the is our policy so we can see

1526
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,390
in the right-half test light that means

1527
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:57,210
when they had and maybe got some some

1528
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:59,190
special prefix with special attribute or

1529
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:01,860
special colors or anything else and his

1530
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:05,490
this is even to trigger they had on the

1531
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:08,009
can request as a policy from controllers

1532
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:09,660
so ii deposit is like that but to the

1533
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:13,170
surplus is from the controller to

1534
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:15,750
download the policy or canada passed to

1535
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:18,390
the head and and so i have different

1536
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:20,640
colors with the step one two three that

1537
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:23,550
means actually this document the chasity

1538
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:26,490
find the step two but one and three is

1539
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:29,870
already exist and so this is just a

1540
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:33,450
brief of the motivation and this is a

1541
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:35,580
little detail about the process and to

1542
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:38,160
talk about how about the scope of this

1543
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:41,870
document which one is the inside this

1544
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:45,510
document which one is out of scope so

1545
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:48,599
the first stab the head under to decide

1546
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:50,850
to get a new candidate pass from the

1547
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,650
controller based on some trigger event

1548
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:55,590
such as I have said received some

1549
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:57,929
special customer routes way the special

1550
01:23:55,590 --> 01:24:00,420
color with special attribute it's just

1551
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:02,640
the example because the the trigger

1552
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:05,460
event is the trigger mechanism is out of

1553
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:08,400
our scope to defined actually is for

1554
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:10,869
more like configuration or Muraki

1555
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:14,009
engineer to decided

1556
01:24:10,869 --> 01:24:17,739
- pre-configured so this is out of our

1557
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:20,979
document but the stab to the head and

1558
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:23,530
when decided to ask this information

1559
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:26,260
that means that he will create BGP

1560
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:29,259
update message this update messages

1561
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:32,860
encoding is it's it's no any change but

1562
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:35,439
we add some new sub t always - for the

1563
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:38,039
constraints for the compute constraints

1564
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:43,030
so this is inside of our document

1565
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:44,829
defined and the stepped step three is

1566
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:47,320
for controller to receive these old

1567
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:48,879
conference from the head and they will

1568
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,879
calculate the as list

1569
01:24:48,879 --> 01:24:55,510
Sekhmet the list for whether this

1570
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:58,570
constraints and then to download the

1571
01:24:55,510 --> 01:25:00,249
eyes our list to the head and and so

1572
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:02,978
this is step three and step four

1573
01:25:00,249 --> 01:25:05,919
all this one three four is out of the

1574
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:08,889
scope of this document some is defined

1575
01:25:05,919 --> 01:25:11,320
in IDR after some is defined in spring

1576
01:25:08,889 --> 01:25:14,919
draft so this is just for this tab

1577
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:17,799
choose a BGP upstate upstate messenger

1578
01:25:14,919 --> 01:25:20,469
for some constraints to ask to the

1579
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:24,280
controller so actually it's not very

1580
01:25:20,469 --> 01:25:26,439
complex for this document so this is for

1581
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:29,949
the encoding of the update message and

1582
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:33,749
some new sub theories update the updates

1583
01:25:29,949 --> 01:25:37,079
messages follows for the existing IDR

1584
01:25:33,749 --> 01:25:42,369
draft signal routing policy that means

1585
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:45,898
Safi RI and policy color and point field

1586
01:25:42,369 --> 01:25:49,449
anything is the same we just gave added

1587
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:53,679
extinguisher with a special special

1588
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:56,558
value with of' to tell the controller is

1589
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:59,050
a request it's for request it cannot be

1590
01:25:56,559 --> 01:26:01,809
used for pass select or anything else so

1591
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:06,550
this is a little special in this field

1592
01:26:01,809 --> 01:26:11,019
and we add five new sub t always for the

1593
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:17,169
candidate past constraints are our SP

1594
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:20,769
attributes as the factor my trick i are

1595
01:26:17,169 --> 01:26:22,910
and the load balancing this v sub t away

1596
01:26:20,769 --> 01:26:27,150
scenes for

1597
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:29,040
constants for the past calculate so this

1598
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:31,379
is a little different I don't I don't I

1599
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:34,290
don't write too much things in the slice

1600
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:36,720
you can you can read in our document

1601
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:39,720
i justa to brief to say how about today

1602
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:42,240
so t always constraints first one is for

1603
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:46,320
the RSP attribute actually is for the

1604
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:48,389
affinity uno in PCE and so are we just

1605
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,790
linked affinity and the color to match

1606
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:51,630
whether this pass will follow some

1607
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:54,780
affinities

1608
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:58,080
so the first sub java is for the our

1609
01:26:54,780 --> 01:27:02,400
spear attribute for for for affinity

1610
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:06,660
this always actually define the yeah our

1611
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:09,450
pc ours and three is three two zero and

1612
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:13,400
a five four four zero and the

1613
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:17,099
secularization factor this is for the

1614
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:23,700
two large hat and to ask this owes as

1615
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:26,610
lists whether have some sorry so for

1616
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:27,150
link device that means but this all sig

1617
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:31,500
mentalist

1618
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:35,280
master dot with the same link in common

1619
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:37,980
note devices means without the same note

1620
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:41,130
as our risk linker ultimate that means

1621
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:44,610
will not share the same link some risks

1622
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:47,910
linked group so this is for two logic

1623
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:50,580
controller to come to compute all these

1624
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:53,099
segmented lists between the mature link

1625
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:56,519
device or no device or some risk linked

1626
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:59,940
groups okay so this is the second sub t

1627
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:03,810
OE and 30s for metric actually for the

1628
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:07,589
segment segment routing actually this is

1629
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:10,860
more important for the t this ticket

1630
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:13,530
with the eleven it so defined arpa-e P

1631
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:17,429
Sigma the routing craft to tutor light

1632
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:20,849
controller know how maximum as see the

1633
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:24,420
tabs should be should be calculate if if

1634
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:27,030
exit the maximum said that pass will not

1635
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:29,880
be established so this is just a for the

1636
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:32,250
metric and the seat tabs to true light

1637
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:35,969
controller to computer the past and the

1638
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:39,510
force is for IR magnets include route

1639
01:28:35,969 --> 01:28:42,750
that means to Latin controller know if

1640
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:46,260
the past must be travel with some note

1641
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:49,080
of some seed or only and all this DDOT

1642
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,100
finding it so defined they are say in

1643
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:53,489
the PCE

1644
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:56,390
and in the sacrament routing and so on

1645
01:28:53,489 --> 01:28:59,699
so then almost are the same but it is

1646
01:28:56,390 --> 01:29:01,500
defined in your BGP message so last one

1647
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:04,500
is load balancing is a little different

1648
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:06,510
in our as a policy it's it's just

1649
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:09,600
because we have some weight for

1650
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:12,530
different athletes so here age define

1651
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:16,770
our load balancing sub theory with max

1652
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:18,599
maximum as least that means to let the

1653
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,310
controller know how many athletes they

1654
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:23,390
should be including the new one-handed

1655
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:26,670
pass so this is a lasted here way so

1656
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:29,219
actually this old master did she always

1657
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:32,910
in the update messages just at your

1658
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:35,040
logical controller to computed the past

1659
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:40,019
the ice released away some constraints

1660
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:42,030
and there's no other no other things so

1661
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:46,350
some details should be in our document

1662
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:49,429
so this this document is very single for

1663
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:52,920
for to understand just that you lat

1664
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:54,989
friendly for our small box equipment in

1665
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:58,260
your network a tool a today as our

1666
01:29:54,989 --> 01:30:01,440
policy tunnel entry no too much for the

1667
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:03,180
small boxes just that you trigger their

1668
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:07,440
own demand together

1669
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:09,180
I saw her policy ton of entries in our

1670
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,299
equipment so the scalability is a

1671
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:14,850
performance it's not very high so Naxos

1672
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:18,510
de is just to see any other commands

1673
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:21,410
about this and to to to to revise our

1674
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:21,410
draft accordingly

1675
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:37,190
were there any questions either now or

1676
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:40,920
remotely I do I'm from I'm from titanium

1677
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:42,929
one question I want to make clarify what

1678
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:46,320
he read yeah I think the kind of

1679
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:51,890
scenario can be covered with the she

1680
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:55,110
said protocol you know it is it is right

1681
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:58,680
right ask for the PDF fellow so what's

1682
01:30:55,110 --> 01:31:03,360
your reason you you make like okay so

1683
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:05,820
based on the PDP yes yes I agree with

1684
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:08,370
you this piece a besides me how the

1685
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:11,370
request and every prime axes messages

1686
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:14,790
can do that but let me see about the P

1687
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:17,130
had and that means because I supposedly

1688
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:18,900
have already defined from PGP from

1689
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:20,760
controller wire bgp protocol from

1690
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:24,450
controller that means the had hand

1691
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:27,390
already support bgp but now if you you

1692
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:30,120
think okay i need to PCP that means that

1693
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:32,970
equipment we need a supporter pcp also i

1694
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:35,190
just say if for the small boxes if we

1695
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:38,190
can unify the protocol is more easy for

1696
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:41,009
operator i don't say it cannot do I just

1697
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:43,469
say is easy to operator we can do it

1698
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:45,990
it's an option if you like that also you

1699
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:48,270
can use PCB I agree with you just the

1700
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:51,360
two lighted it boxes I have said it's

1701
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:53,700
friendly for some small boxes on our our

1702
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:55,740
network I don't say we cannot do it

1703
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:59,700
addressing is Morse friendly for this

1704
01:31:55,740 --> 01:32:02,160
equipment yeah Stefan for orange please

1705
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:04,679
use precept to do this you are with lady

1706
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:07,650
you are replicating everything which is

1707
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:10,620
in peace app just use preset BGP is

1708
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:13,139
distribution protocol it's not a request

1709
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:16,380
and then send me just something you are

1710
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:19,080
completely changing what HP so please

1711
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:22,530
you say yes yes I agree with you totally

1712
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:25,620
agree but again I am asked to say if the

1713
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:29,490
step three I have said because we have

1714
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:31,559
defined IDR draft to use BGP to send

1715
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:33,870
candidate a pass from controller to the

1716
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:35,370
equipment but to why at that time we

1717
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:38,190
don't say okay if you see if you can do

1718
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:40,410
it why we use beauty I just to say

1719
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:41,098
because we have defined some mechanism

1720
01:32:40,410 --> 01:32:44,010
against BGP

1721
01:32:41,099 --> 01:32:45,769
so we must at you to do something to

1722
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:48,659
help this bitch if you can't do more

1723
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:54,749
other things for the equipment I just

1724
01:32:48,659 --> 01:32:56,489
say it's option yeah looking at this and

1725
01:32:54,749 --> 01:32:59,760
I know there are a lot of people who'd

1726
01:32:56,489 --> 01:33:02,249
like pset I personally will ask you why

1727
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,889
aren't you using Jia PC for this which

1728
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:06,780
is used everywhere I mean but basically

1729
01:33:04,889 --> 01:33:09,629
why wouldn't you use anything other than

1730
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:12,108
BGP for this because you know as someone

1731
01:33:09,629 --> 01:33:15,449
else said the BGP is therefore

1732
01:33:12,109 --> 01:33:18,300
distributing information not kind of

1733
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:20,098
requesting config information and if I'm

1734
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:24,379
going to request config information or

1735
01:33:20,099 --> 01:33:27,689
something then your PCP set anything but

1736
01:33:24,379 --> 01:33:32,899
yes I agree I totally agree because we

1737
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:36,479
can say something like here I have that

1738
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:39,030
existing draft we defined yes GRCC

1739
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:41,760
yes not copy yes they are yes BGP yes

1740
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:45,419
piece of everything is okay so at that

1741
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,189
time wait don't say why you use so many

1742
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:50,010
misers why not

1743
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:52,109
so do you know because we can't get it

1744
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:54,389
from beauty piece so now we defined a

1745
01:33:52,109 --> 01:33:56,789
new mechanism before to lat ability

1746
01:33:54,389 --> 01:34:00,479
can't get a request I think it is easy

1747
01:33:56,789 --> 01:34:03,539
to understand yes I totally agree not

1748
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:07,709
come okay say I okay did you hear or not

1749
01:34:03,539 --> 01:34:09,509
pizza okay no problem but I must say BGP

1750
01:34:07,709 --> 01:34:27,479
should be also be okay it's like that

1751
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:29,820
yeah I think that's we face some the

1752
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:32,999
scenarios there's now that so they

1753
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:35,188
always use the PDP instead of the p7 and

1754
01:34:32,999 --> 01:34:39,419
maybe you understand the data center

1755
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:41,999
network here there's a the fact you not

1756
01:34:39,419 --> 01:34:44,849
use that he said but the PDP as our

1757
01:34:41,999 --> 01:34:47,280
policy in the introduced so I think that

1758
01:34:44,849 --> 01:34:50,789
they say is a possible way to unify the

1759
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:53,369
protocol to request the Connie data path

1760
01:34:50,789 --> 01:34:55,050
and it will download us Ruby deep here I

1761
01:34:53,369 --> 01:34:57,330
think this and maybe

1762
01:34:55,050 --> 01:35:01,440
America for the operation that's the

1763
01:34:57,330 --> 01:35:04,290
purpose I see someone standing is that

1764
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:13,500
from the lengthy discussions or did you

1765
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:18,050
want to make come on Zach emancipate

1766
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:18,050
please from Minister thank you so much

1767
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:30,509
[Music]

1768
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:51,990
ok that warmed us up for good set of

1769
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:56,360
discussions on the Charter thank you

1770
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:59,990
very much ok this is gonna hopefully be

1771
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:03,450
feedback kind for the chairs

1772
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:06,540
first of all I've been sending statuses

1773
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:10,080
out more frequently every two to three

1774
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:14,030
weeks or so little hum from the room was

1775
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,030
that a good idea was that a bad idea

1776
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:24,810
oh you can't humble okay folks tell me

1777
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:28,610
come forward was that is that helpful is

1778
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:30,990
that helpful a quiet home home before

1779
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:34,320
don't waste your time sooo it's okay we

1780
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:35,610
don't need it well that's a silence it's

1781
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:40,580
doing it keep doing it

1782
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:43,620
okay that's it so if I could Jeff has

1783
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:46,140
that I love the status it shows us where

1784
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:48,570
we're at having everything in one

1785
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:52,680
message means that threads that get

1786
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:55,110
kicked off of that are hard to follow so

1787
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:56,640
you have 16 things inside of a status

1788
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:57,900
item and then we end up with all these

1789
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,230
discussions around it when you go to

1790
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:03,870
look and see do I care about this thread

1791
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:05,820
so this is really no location is to

1792
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:07,719
macro fragment the status down to status

1793
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:12,070
on each individual work out

1794
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:13,540
not quite that that it's it's a little

1795
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:16,420
hard to fault where's the suggestion

1796
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:20,199
that people following up should create a

1797
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:25,150
new thread that would be helpful so Jeff

1798
01:37:20,199 --> 01:37:28,809
nods yes Jeff hots got it okay

1799
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:30,790
this has been on the list new charter

1800
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:32,440
talks about what we expect from peer

1801
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:35,080
working groups what they can expect from

1802
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:38,620
righty air and removes the old crufty

1803
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:40,930
stuff that was in there if it passes

1804
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:43,599
then we're gonna update milestones this

1805
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:49,150
is just to give a bit of a discussion

1806
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:51,670
going so this is the Charter text if

1807
01:37:49,150 --> 01:37:55,179
anybody has questions John sent it out

1808
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:58,390
mostly we got plus ones if you have any

1809
01:37:55,180 --> 01:38:00,400
questions I'll cycle through this if not

1810
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:02,260
we'll go to the thing that John and I

1811
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,660
would really like which is tell us which

1812
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:19,090
is the next important thing to do here

1813
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:20,440
so we can just okay yeah I think you

1814
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:22,210
might have been you know typing in your

1815
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,799
sleep or something so we'll just take it

1816
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:30,730
later okay

1817
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:32,620
comment yes so speaking as best working

1818
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:37,120
group co-chair

1819
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:39,750
I would like just to know why you added

1820
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:43,210
more text about the relationship between

1821
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:48,880
idea under the other working groups as

1822
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:51,280
you seen some issues or ID requests from

1823
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,949
other people sorry we had requests from

1824
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,750
other working groups we may already work

1825
01:38:53,949 --> 01:38:58,509
well you know together or another

1826
01:38:55,750 --> 01:39:02,500
working group says sustain it because in

1827
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:05,770
my opinion the job of idea is really to

1828
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:08,860
create the base infrastructure for BGP

1829
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:11,020
and define all the guidelines for other

1830
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:14,110
working groups to be able to use it as

1831
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:18,100
far and as long as we are within with

1832
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:20,130
guidelines I think we don't really need

1833
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:21,550
a kind of review or something but

1834
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:24,370
sometimes

1835
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:27,040
it's borderline and we need more

1836
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:31,990
extension to be TP and in this case of

1837
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:35,260
course you need to be you need to be

1838
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:40,710
contacted and probably someone needs to

1839
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:44,800
be done within idea but I just want to

1840
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:47,500
to avoid slowing down some work we could

1841
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,210
have if it is just real very simple

1842
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,740
things that we need to add like just a

1843
01:39:49,210 --> 01:39:53,740
new extended community of something

1844
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:55,540
right so so that's the intent of this

1845
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:58,690
what what you just said I couldn't agree

1846
01:39:55,540 --> 01:40:00,610
more and that's what we tried to write

1847
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:03,370
in the Charter if you think we missed

1848
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:05,049
that you know and created like more

1849
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:06,730
process and it's gonna be a problem

1850
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:09,130
that's exactly the kind of feedback we

1851
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:12,490
need to hear and we should so there's a

1852
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:14,020
way what you said yeah it is that for

1853
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:17,950
each good point that we need to allocate

1854
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:20,470
we need an agreement from idea so okay

1855
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:24,790
what what what we tried to write was for

1856
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:27,430
each should be consulted tufted let me

1857
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:30,370
give an example of a place where I want

1858
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:33,430
IDR engaged heavily and an example of a

1859
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:35,710
case where I don't so a case where I

1860
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:37,840
think that I BR should be thoroughly

1861
01:40:35,710 --> 01:40:42,280
engaged is if you're creating a new path

1862
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:45,220
attribute an example of a case where I'd

1863
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:48,450
like single message to the IVR mailing

1864
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:54,130
list is if you're allocating a new

1865
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:55,750
well-known extend community and and you

1866
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:58,060
know it's not a it's not a blocking

1867
01:40:55,750 --> 01:41:01,720
email to the the mailing list assumed a

1868
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:07,000
hello okay make sense yeah

1869
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:09,940
the other point back is about the exact

1870
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,140
scopes that idea is dealing with about

1871
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:16,299
VF surface so you secure on text that

1872
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:19,030
you are displaying is telling about okay

1873
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:21,520
we are managing ipv4 and ipv6 so

1874
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:24,910
Internet is that exact scope that you

1875
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:27,760
are limited to just to try to clearly

1876
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:29,440
define the boundary between what you are

1877
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:33,850
doing and what we could do in base and

1878
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:35,558
so on I would say that is not intended

1879
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:38,170
to be limiting

1880
01:41:35,559 --> 01:41:41,079
and and in fact the text is right now

1881
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:46,110
written in a way that it's it's not

1882
01:41:41,079 --> 01:41:48,699
intended to be hard scoped hmm because

1883
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:52,150
people bring new stuff along and we'd

1884
01:41:48,699 --> 01:41:54,428
like to at least be and and there's good

1885
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:58,388
reason to be in various places you know

1886
01:41:54,429 --> 01:41:59,530
we need to have as many threads through

1887
01:41:58,389 --> 01:42:02,619
this as possible

1888
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:05,709
hmm to get the workload through so not

1889
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:09,869
intended suggest something we can fix

1890
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:14,340
okay so you know that said for example I

1891
01:42:09,869 --> 01:42:14,339
have no intention of trying to find

1892
01:42:14,459 --> 01:42:19,989
there are some things that would be good

1893
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:23,949
to consult as we do the new tunnel

1894
01:42:19,989 --> 01:42:26,348
attribute we've got to figure out how we

1895
01:42:23,949 --> 01:42:28,119
transition things to the new tunnel

1896
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:30,219
attribute from the extended community

1897
01:42:28,119 --> 01:42:32,380
what makes sense that's a discussion

1898
01:42:30,219 --> 01:42:34,510
there's a lot of there's a lot of play

1899
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:36,489
back and forth where things are deployed

1900
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:38,889
where things are not let's be sensible

1901
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:41,768
let's get the code that's out there out

1902
01:42:38,889 --> 01:42:44,619
there and not block that so this is not

1903
01:42:41,769 --> 01:42:47,969
meant to do that's another example where

1904
01:42:44,619 --> 01:42:50,739
we're really trying to be reasonable in

1905
01:42:47,969 --> 01:42:52,420
yeah because for this kind of example so

1906
01:42:50,739 --> 01:42:55,539
suit turn Aaron Capps we are still in a

1907
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:59,459
kind of transition period but as soon as

1908
01:42:55,539 --> 01:43:02,650
we are in E in the more yeah future

1909
01:42:59,459 --> 01:43:08,170
where the tonal attributes will be maybe

1910
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:11,459
always used yeah why do we need I just

1911
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:13,630
refer to just that okay to a new type

1912
01:43:11,459 --> 01:43:14,409
right that's the point of saying just

1913
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:20,170
send us an email

1914
01:43:14,409 --> 01:43:23,558
hmm so just to be clear with you you're

1915
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:25,780
doing nothing wrong necessarily what we

1916
01:43:23,559 --> 01:43:28,780
really want here is is there are many

1917
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:32,170
working groups that work on PGP stuff we

1918
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:34,360
just want to make sure that we know so

1919
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:36,610
yes we don't want to slow everything

1920
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:37,688
down or IDR and the other working group

1921
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:39,429
and everyone else has to prove

1922
01:43:37,689 --> 01:43:41,199
everything we don't want to do that

1923
01:43:39,429 --> 01:43:42,489
because we wanted to do that we were

1924
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:44,438
just close everything else just do

1925
01:43:42,489 --> 01:43:47,370
everything here but we went the other

1926
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:51,120
way so

1927
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:54,090
want this you know just information it

1928
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:56,430
may be that there is something that you

1929
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:58,080
think is really important and IDR says

1930
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:58,920
oh okay thank you for that's known yeah

1931
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:01,019
that's it

1932
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,150
it may be the other way around where you

1933
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:05,100
inform us or something that is routine

1934
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:07,170
and someone says oh but that's really

1935
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:10,410
important as it changes something so

1936
01:44:07,170 --> 01:44:11,640
that that type of information and that's

1937
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:13,830
it you know we can go from there and we

1938
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:15,030
when I say we I mean the chairs can

1939
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:19,350
coordinate from there there's anything

1940
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:21,210
else needed but the basis one really

1941
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:23,130
good example where we did some good

1942
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:26,850
collaboration anything this week is in

1943
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:29,130
the IPSec stuff that was really that

1944
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:31,650
that session brought up lots for the

1945
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:34,110
best slots for where the proposals that

1946
01:44:31,650 --> 01:44:35,730
came to IDR where the good stuff that's

1947
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:44,250
that's more of the stuff we'd like to

1948
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:47,280
see okay and you know we welcome

1949
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:49,680
requirements don't don't just send you

1950
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:51,650
know stuff back and forth if you think

1951
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:56,250
we should be doing something tell us

1952
01:44:51,650 --> 01:45:04,710
okay anything else on the Charter great

1953
01:44:56,250 --> 01:45:06,960
comments okay this picture may these are

1954
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:09,210
the issues that people gave me on the

1955
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:13,200
list I tried to send it out this morning

1956
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:15,420
that's a long set of issues okay what

1957
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:17,849
some people told me is I tried to give

1958
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:22,200
snapshots in some Ridge but some of them

1959
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:25,020
weren't really terrific so I've left the

1960
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:28,190
issue list and we can start with yeah

1961
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:31,020
let's just go and tell us what the top

1962
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:33,929
issues you want to try to work on or I

1963
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:37,140
can dive down a little bit into issues

1964
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:39,780
that are interesting they're on the

1965
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:43,440
slides you can look at it the only thing

1966
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:45,330
I think we'd really and I've started

1967
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:48,179
working group last calls or adoption

1968
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:51,240
calls in several of these phases the

1969
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:53,580
only thing I'd really might be really

1970
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:56,250
interesting to go into in detail is

1971
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:58,980
faster registry handling but because

1972
01:45:56,250 --> 01:46:01,160
that could snarl us with a lot of

1973
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:04,040
process discussion I wanted to make

1974
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:06,650
sure we got to the meat first anybody

1975
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:11,750
want me to dive down is this the time to

1976
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:15,589
ask questions so dive down what is the

1977
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:17,720
right thing hum come to the mic if you

1978
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:20,320
want I that's come to the mic if you'd

1979
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:25,930
like me to dive down into any of these

1980
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:28,160
tell me which one yeah I mean you you

1981
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:30,890
talk long enough that people have had a

1982
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,910
chance to read the list and you know if

1983
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:36,650
there's one there that they want to

1984
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:39,200
engage on how's the time so in case

1985
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:41,420
Sidney Elora Thunder alley needy in case

1986
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,220
anyone didn't come to the other medium

1987
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:45,620
once they where we talk about there is

1988
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:48,410
that what one of you is produce a

1989
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:49,790
general charter this would like their

1990
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:52,250
does coordinators with other working

1991
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:53,570
groups you know etc so that we don't end

1992
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:55,130
in the same situation that we are now

1993
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:56,630
where we have a charter that lists a

1994
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:58,040
bunch of stuff that we already finish

1995
01:46:56,630 --> 01:47:00,230
some things that we are delivering to do

1996
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:01,700
and we're actually working on stuff that

1997
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:04,639
it's not really in the Charter that

1998
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:07,370
we're just taking on because you know

1999
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:10,430
it's the right thing to do so so that we

2000
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:13,940
don't reach our Terraria we want to just

2001
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:17,600
manage and I say we as the chairs are

2002
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:19,879
going to manage the flow of the working

2003
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,560
group based on milestones so what we're

2004
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:23,330
really looking for now is talking about

2005
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,470
hey there's a list of issues what are

2006
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:25,460
the issues are really the priority for

2007
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:28,160
the working group that we should put

2008
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:29,900
first in the milestones so that we know

2009
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:32,840
that those are important and worker

2010
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:36,200
those and then the chairs can manage

2011
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:38,330
where you see that as okay this is one

2012
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:40,460
review process first etc we can also

2013
01:47:38,330 --> 01:47:43,010
measure later and discuss have a more

2014
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:44,750
dynamic discussion maybe not every other

2015
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:47,840
year but I don't know whatever once a

2016
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:50,350
year whatever it is that we can add

2017
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:53,330
things to shorten this remove things

2018
01:47:50,350 --> 01:47:55,730
figure out whatever whatever it was so

2019
01:47:53,330 --> 01:47:57,380
instead of having 27 things like that it

2020
01:47:55,730 --> 01:48:01,759
would be nice if we knew what they were

2021
01:47:57,380 --> 01:48:06,290
can do it wanted to focus I mean you

2022
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:08,540
would be great if people have well

2023
01:48:06,290 --> 01:48:11,600
thought through ideas on this now they

2024
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:13,100
want to share super but otherwise that

2025
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,080
you know blood sugar is running low

2026
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:17,840
prior to lunch

2027
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:20,450
you're tired after a long week really

2028
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:23,060
the more important thing to do is you

2029
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:27,500
know as you're traveling home you know

2030
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:29,330
next week whatever let's have a real

2031
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:33,530
discussion on the list about about

2032
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:35,750
prioritizing or milestones but I don't

2033
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:37,130
think we would you know even if we said

2034
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:39,620
no we're going to use our next meeting

2035
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:41,600
slot to to do milestone prioritization

2036
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:48,290
it's it's not like it would conclude

2037
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:50,830
very successful a seal in Damascus

2038
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:54,010
systems I just want to say over the last

2039
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:58,970
month and a half I see I've seen a

2040
01:48:54,010 --> 01:49:01,250
significant uptick on address and the

2041
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:03,950
things that needed to be addressed that

2042
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:05,180
really you know we're blocking documents

2043
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:09,650
like the tunnel end caps and other

2044
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:12,440
things and I think getting some of the

2045
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:15,469
work done where there are

2046
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:17,330
implementations you know you know and a

2047
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:20,450
lot of that I realize you don't have a

2048
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:22,100
car you can't make people Interop test

2049
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:24,110
you get one implementation you can't

2050
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:27,250
make somebody do another one but I think

2051
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:30,139
I think I've seen it seems like we made

2052
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:33,280
more progress in the last month and a

2053
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:40,070
half than the preceding four months

2054
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:42,950
thank you thank you AC we've been trying

2055
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:45,460
to do that I've been trying to push John

2056
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:47,570
should we cover the fast registry stuff

2057
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:55,250
you've got that one let me get through

2058
01:49:47,570 --> 01:50:00,259
it so I don't think this should take too

2059
01:49:55,250 --> 01:50:02,330
long but it apparently is my my destiny

2060
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:11,350
to talk about registries like every

2061
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:14,559
meeting okay yep do little soft-shoe

2062
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:22,360
note that I did here we go

2063
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:25,010
so you let's see

2064
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:29,809
just go ahead and talk about about early

2065
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:32,240
allocation so you know that the you know

2066
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:34,190
over the last few years we are you know

2067
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:36,019
have continued to try to improve our

2068
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:37,759
sanitation in terms of how we allocate

2069
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:42,530
coat points

2070
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:45,350
part of that is by really trying hard

2071
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:47,030
not to have people squat on code points

2072
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:48,020
including by publishing them you know

2073
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:52,940
just picking them out of there and

2074
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:54,530
publishing them in their drafts so you

2075
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:56,509
know that's the stick half of it but we

2076
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:58,219
have to provide accurate half also which

2077
01:50:56,510 --> 01:51:02,600
is to have a way of giving you code

2078
01:50:58,220 --> 01:51:03,590
points easily when you need them and I'm

2079
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:05,960
not going to repeat why that's

2080
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,640
incredibly important one of the tools

2081
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:11,300
that we've tried hard to use for that is

2082
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:13,490
early allocation the early allocation

2083
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:15,410
policy is a thing that says look if

2084
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:17,570
you've got a draft that's sort of

2085
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:20,030
progressing towards becoming an RFC one

2086
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:22,910
of these days you need a code point in

2087
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:23,630
order to get your implementation done so

2088
01:51:22,910 --> 01:51:27,320
you can actually show some

2089
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:28,790
interoperation we think that's great we

2090
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:30,769
want to have a way of doing that before

2091
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:31,970
you get your RFC number so that you

2092
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:35,750
don't get stuck in a chicken-and-egg

2093
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:38,210
problem there's a RFC that says how to

2094
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:39,200
do this it's got four criteria I'm not

2095
01:51:38,210 --> 01:51:41,000
going to read them all to you because

2096
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:44,059
the first three are things like you know

2097
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,100
is there is there a spec does it make

2098
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:48,290
sense stuff like that and your chairs

2099
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:51,950
are willing to take on the the duty of

2100
01:51:48,290 --> 01:51:54,440
saying you know clearing those three the

2101
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:57,500
fourth is one that we have in the past

2102
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:59,780
construed as meaning it talks about

2103
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:01,370
interest in the community and you know

2104
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:02,780
we've said well we have a consensus

2105
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:04,280
process that we use for a lot of

2106
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,480
different things and let's use this for

2107
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:07,880
a sort of judging interest in the

2108
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:09,860
community and that's resulted in you

2109
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:14,780
know we need a consensus call on early

2110
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:17,120
allocation of does and such and that

2111
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:18,740
adds at least two weeks of latency I

2112
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:20,480
mean if we're really on the ball and we

2113
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:22,460
like fire off the consensus call right

2114
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,780
away and we conclude the consensus call

2115
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:28,940
right away which as you know we don't

2116
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:30,440
always do and I was talking with Alvaro

2117
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:32,690
the other day and you know he basically

2118
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:35,160
smacked me around and said John you

2119
01:52:32,690 --> 01:52:39,019
already have gone through a consensus

2120
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:41,460
process to adopt a working group draft

2121
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:44,760
explain to me why that doesn't mean you

2122
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:46,290
have community consensus already and I

2123
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:50,340
sort of hemmed and hawed but really he

2124
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:55,320
was writing so the proposal is that

2125
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:58,500
going forward what we're gonna do is if

2126
01:52:55,320 --> 01:53:01,019
you have a working group draft and you

2127
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:02,400
know authors and implementers come to

2128
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:04,290
the chairs come to the working group and

2129
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,839
say yeah we want our Li allocation we

2130
01:53:04,290 --> 01:53:08,370
think it's time that we are going to

2131
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:11,010
believe you and we are going to believe

2132
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:12,720
that we've already got community

2133
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:15,330
consensus and we're just going to

2134
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:17,100
process it forward we'll you know ping

2135
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:18,690
the list and you know we'll expect this

2136
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:21,330
all to take place in public on the list

2137
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:23,040
of course but instead of saying you know

2138
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:26,300
you have two weeks to get your comments

2139
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:29,280
and we're just gonna say we're doing it

2140
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:31,170
and if you're if you wish to scream

2141
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,880
bloody murder you had better take it

2142
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:34,860
upon yourself to do that otherwise we'll

2143
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:38,550
just proceed forward allocate the code

2144
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:42,690
points and go on of course part of the

2145
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:46,140
reason that you have humans as working

2146
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:49,200
group co-chairs and not automation is so

2147
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:50,820
that we can exercise discretion so you

2148
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,920
know we may sometimes exercise

2149
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:54,780
discretion and say you know what yes

2150
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:58,110
your draft is a working group draft but

2151
01:53:54,780 --> 01:54:00,030
it's actually been five years since it

2152
01:53:58,110 --> 01:54:02,219
became a working group draft and we're

2153
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:03,360
not really convinced that anybody in the

2154
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:05,640
working group is paying attention

2155
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:08,490
anymore we really need to you know

2156
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:12,300
actually do a consensus call on this but

2157
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:14,400
in general the proposal is that we just

2158
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:19,080
kind of speed things up on on early

2159
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:21,480
allocations so you know pros and cons I

2160
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:24,450
think I covered them already if you have

2161
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:27,959
any opinions on this please provide them

2162
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:30,269
especially if you are opposed to it if

2163
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:32,070
you're in favor I mean you know attaboys

2164
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:34,050
are you know plus ones are all very well

2165
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:36,660
but mainly this is to give you an

2166
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:38,370
opportunity of saying you know to say no

2167
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:40,410
please don't do this because we think

2168
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:46,920
that the the two-week consensus call was

2169
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:48,330
a valuable gate I hear silence there is

2170
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:50,430
one other

2171
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:52,350
 out in your last one that was my

2172
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:57,060
air I think that I could tell that out

2173
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:58,950
the status I will be tracking any early

2174
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:01,800
code adoption you requested if you

2175
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:04,230
thought you had it and it isn't in the

2176
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:07,950
registry within a week please send me an

2177
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:11,009
email and we'll I'll go track it down

2178
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:15,450
oh and and I did promise to come back

2179
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:18,750
and say specifically as regards to the

2180
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:23,849
BG pls registry is Adrienne has been so

2181
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:25,470
kind as to write a short draft which the

2182
01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:30,330
BG pls registries were kind of neither

2183
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:34,170
fish nor fowl they're designated no

2184
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:35,880
specification required which according

2185
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:37,650
to Hannes he always thought that what

2186
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:40,140
that was supposed to mean was just an

2187
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:42,599
internet draft when you go and actually

2188
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:45,150
read the relevant RFC is it really

2189
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:48,540
doesn't mean that and so essentially

2190
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:50,670
Adrienne's draft more or less tries to

2191
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:53,519
move it in to just have an internet

2192
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:57,860
draft is that pretty accurate so if you

2193
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:59,760
have obviously as with any other

2194
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:01,349
document destined to the working group

2195
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:04,110
if you have some opinions on that please

2196
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:09,150
provide them on the list and questions

2197
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:13,880
video photo Telecom just one simple

2198
01:56:09,150 --> 01:56:17,879
question for the earlier location for

2199
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:22,110
figuring out what the well okay how much

2200
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:27,450
value two weeks waiting time has

2201
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:32,519
provided so far do you have at hand or

2202
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:35,090
could you just check the statistics how

2203
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:40,350
many early calls we had and how many

2204
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:46,380
actually resulted in some thing were the

2205
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:49,260
waiting time actually in the last I'm

2206
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:52,140
just gonna give you a rough I but the

2207
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:53,810
rough estimate is we had at least my

2208
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:58,020
guess is about fifteen to seventeen

2209
01:56:53,810 --> 01:57:00,780
calls we had to that people ask

2210
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,990
questions that I'm simply had follow-up

2211
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:06,759
all the rest were

2212
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:10,840
Plus Ones support snore you know but two

2213
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:13,870
hits and comments those also could have

2214
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:16,630
come up in the working group adoption

2215
01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:20,019
process instead of having plus ones

2216
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:23,530
there so yeah well okay kind of kind of

2217
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:26,140
I could imagine a situation where I did

2218
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:30,759
not take the chance to oppose the

2219
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:34,060
adoption and then feel bad about the

2220
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:37,630
early allocation but kind of that's not

2221
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:40,150
really relevant so I get I gather you

2222
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:46,000
are saying essentially yes there has

2223
01:57:40,150 --> 01:57:49,679
been some discussion but actually the

2224
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:55,560
decision to UVO early allocation

2225
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:55,560
actually never was denied correct

2226
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:06,160
hi kitten the logical Cisco system so

2227
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:08,679
for the bt pls thing as an implementer i

2228
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:12,730
think we I definitely would like to have

2229
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:15,190
a specification required and not really

2230
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:17,290
fall back to the experts review because

2231
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:21,250
experts review doesn't need a

2232
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:24,070
specification I think nobody said so you

2233
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:27,760
should really drills draft that is not

2234
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:30,070
the case yes I understand but the other

2235
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:32,680
point that I wanted to bring was the the

2236
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:35,469
the contention was because internet

2237
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:37,300
drafts are called temporary and that's

2238
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:39,010
where we thought that you know they

2239
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:42,400
cannot be used as a reference for

2240
01:58:39,010 --> 01:58:45,790
specification can't we just you know do

2241
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:47,759
an update or something on 8126 that for

2242
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:52,000
the purpose of specification required

2243
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:54,840
internet drafts are not temporary so IDR

2244
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:03,190
is not the correct place to update 8126

2245
01:58:54,840 --> 01:59:05,140
it's a anna is actually working on an

2246
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:07,509
update to a twenty six so if you have

2247
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:09,270
suggestions please touch that and the

2248
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:11,950
other thing I was gonna say is that

2249
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:14,630
extra review doesn't listen lean that

2250
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:18,420
the expert does whatever they want

2251
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:20,760
ideally and this is in 8126 it says that

2252
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:22,980
the the RFC should provide guidance to

2253
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:25,139
the experts so if you want something

2254
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:27,030
specific for the experts to do for

2255
01:59:25,139 --> 01:59:29,810
example denying anything that comes from

2256
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:31,860
Adrian you can put it in the arm see and

2257
01:59:29,810 --> 01:59:34,770
you know whatever the working wants

2258
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:41,848
including the expert can consider or

2259
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:47,040
should accept it or drafts Ketan read

2260
01:59:41,849 --> 01:59:49,320
the draft as a vera says there's

2261
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:51,900
direction to the expert route to the

2262
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:54,630
experts and the the draft that I've

2263
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:58,129
written says that requests that come

2264
01:59:54,630 --> 02:00:02,550
from the ITF must have an internet draft

2265
01:59:58,130 --> 02:00:06,030
to your point and updating 8126 yes talk

2266
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:10,429
to i anna but calling black/white will

2267
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:14,599
not change the nature of black an

2268
02:00:10,429 --> 02:00:17,550
internet draft is it maybe archival e

2269
02:00:14,599 --> 02:00:19,969
available but it is not a stable

2270
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:23,340
reference so if what you want is

2271
02:00:19,969 --> 02:00:25,650
specification and i hear that if what

2272
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:28,080
you want is specification then let's

2273
02:00:25,650 --> 02:00:30,809
stay with specification required but ask

2274
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:33,210
for a specification if what you want is

2275
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:36,780
internet draft then let's loosen it a

2276
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:41,520
bit and direct the experts to say an

2277
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:47,570
internet draft is good enough yeah sure

2278
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:47,570
I mean I defer to Adrian knows better

2279
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:58,469
though I understand and I have question

2280
02:00:55,980 --> 02:01:01,650
on how to read this really there you say

2281
02:00:58,469 --> 02:01:04,409
adopt this approach and that is fine I

2282
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:07,049
think you can as a working group chair

2283
02:01:04,409 --> 02:01:13,790
take the decision you can judge that

2284
02:01:07,050 --> 02:01:16,380
there are consensus at any time yeah the

2285
02:01:13,790 --> 02:01:18,869
experience I have is that sometimes I

2286
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:21,119
can do that and we are close to working

2287
02:01:18,869 --> 02:01:24,420
group adoption they had good discussion

2288
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:27,660
and yeah just go ahead other cases it's

2289
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:29,970
a kind of six months later

2290
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:32,550
after working group adoption discussion

2291
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:34,800
has been kinda weak on the list and I

2292
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:37,440
don't really know then I do the - we

2293
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:40,560
call or it's got somewhere in between I

2294
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:43,889
do one week fall so you should be

2295
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:46,590
allowed to do all those things to have

2296
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:48,330
enough information to judge if there is

2297
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:51,240
consensus to actually do another

2298
02:01:48,330 --> 02:01:53,400
location okay thank you yeah I think

2299
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:55,830
they were in agreement that and really

2300
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:57,960
the the purpose of putting up these

2301
02:01:55,830 --> 02:02:01,890
slides and talking about this is because

2302
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:03,450
you know we have through our behavior

2303
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:06,810
trained to the working group to expect

2304
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:08,130
you know one set of procedures from the

2305
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:10,140
chairs and now we're saying now we're

2306
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:13,500
gonna change a little bit you know like

2307
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:15,120
Lola has described and you know just

2308
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,560
please don't be don't be surprised and

2309
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:20,900
if you you know have concerns or

2310
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:25,410
whatever and let us know that's it so

2311
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:29,070
the way you decide that do you want to

2312
02:02:25,410 --> 02:02:31,980
judge consensus it's probably very close

2313
02:02:29,070 --> 02:02:34,349
to without appeal you decide how you

2314
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:38,549
want to do if you do it that way and you

2315
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:40,530
get the information you need what I'm

2316
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:43,650
saying is if you say if you are sure

2317
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:47,309
there is no consensus well yes go ahead

2318
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:49,530
if you want to do a poll do a poll or if

2319
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:52,730
you want to use some other method do

2320
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:58,860
that and it's it's sufficient you decide

2321
02:02:52,730 --> 02:03:01,349
thank you and we are now two minutes

2322
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:05,809
over but I don't feel guilty because

2323
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:08,220
we're cancelling our final session and

2324
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:17,340
let's get out of here hope to see you in

2325
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:19,890
Singapore oh and if somebody has the

2326
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:21,300
other blue sheet if you could wave it

2327
02:03:19,890 --> 02:03:24,590
around bring it forward something like

2328
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:24,590
that it would be helpful thank you

2329
02:03:49,429 --> 02:03:51,489
you
