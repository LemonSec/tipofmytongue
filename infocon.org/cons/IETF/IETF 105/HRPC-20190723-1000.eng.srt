good morning everybody welcome to HRP

12
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,260
seem more about five minutes late but

13
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,200
that's it's the first session of the day

14
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,240
thank you for coming and it is it is

15
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,599
just me today I'm Mallory notall I'm

16
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:12,260
with article 19 but my co-chair ivory

17
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Doria is on meet echo and I think we're

18
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,770
all ready I'm just checking yeah I think

19
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,810
I remote presenters are all here we have

20
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,729
our slides loaded and the blue sheets

21
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:29,540
are going round so yep you'll see we

22
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:32,420
have a nice busy agenda up first we're

23
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:36,200
going to have a talk by Juan Carlos de

24
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,420
Martin for the first 30 minutes I'll let

25
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,870
him introduce himself and in his talk

26
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,030
and then we'll discuss two drafts that

27
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,680
are adopted by the research already one

28
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,000
is on draft Association so I believe

29
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,820
Johan Stefan Carter are going to be

30
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,310
representing on that and then draft

31
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,260
political will be presented and

32
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:02,630
discussed by Nielsen over remotely and

33
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,120
and then we have also a draft that has

34
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,030
been discussed in this group a few times

35
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,220
now on the intersection of protocols and

36
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,390
feminism it's not yet adopted by the

37
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,960
research group but we do have some

38
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,820
updates on that and then lastly on the

39
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,729
scheduled portion of the agenda we're

40
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,890
going to discuss the guidelines draft

41
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,430
which is also a research group draft

42
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:29,150
them that sort of builds on our RFC 80

43
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:34,100
to 80 and allows people to sort of

44
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:36,169
engage in valuate review IETF work from

45
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,900
the perspective of human rights and so

46
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,990
that item and that draft are coupled

47
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,630
with small presentations by people

48
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,570
who've been doing reviews in IETF to

49
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,750
understand how that's working out where

50
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,900
that draft is and any other things

51
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,100
related to doing those reviews and then

52
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,950
we

53
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,320
alb so if anybody has something to add

54
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,210
an a OB it'd be good to know sooner

55
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,560
rather than later so we can make sure we

56
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,150
have enough time for it so if you have

57
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,190
something that you've been dying to put

58
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,609
on the agenda could you let me know let

59
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:17,610
me know now it can a we are doing some

60
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:21,370
agenda review anyone okay

61
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,830
well we'll see at the end if you have

62
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,070
something that pops up okay so the note

63
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,539
well it is only Tuesday so maybe you

64
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,030
haven't seen it and the text is really

65
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,830
tiny so you might actually have to bring

66
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:37,419
that up on your machine if you need to

67
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:39,250
read the note well just a review of this

68
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,490
research group for people who have not

69
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,940
been here before we were chartered in

70
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:49,930
the IRT F as a research group to look at

71
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,330
how protocols can strengthen or be a

72
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,000
detriment to human rights and human

73
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,990
rights being very specifically defined

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,070
as a standard in fact for the by the UN

75
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:07,780
D R & D HR and the ICCPR yeah so the the

76
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,080
tasks that we've identified under that

77
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:14,230
Charter are to look at the relationship

78
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,990
between protocols and human rights but

79
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,320
specifically we have in our charter to

80
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:26,230
focus on freedom of expression and

81
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,750
freedom of assembly and as well we are

82
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,950
looking at the guidelines to protect the

83
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,770
Internet's Human Rights enabling

84
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,290
environment for future protocol

85
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,069
development so it's we were inspired by

86
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:42,160
RFC 69 73 and that is sort of what we

87
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:45,430
have now with RFC 82 80 which I will get

88
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,469
to as part of the history and yeah

89
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,719
generally speaking to to talk about

90
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,050
human rights in this setting and to

91
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,900
increase awareness and and raise the

92
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,140
capacity to discuss these complicated

93
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:02,819
social issues in the context of in

94
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,410
engineering and technical space so we

95
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,600
the the research group is seeking to of

96
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,699
course put together internet drafts

97
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,649
the focus on research we're also

98
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:13,689
interested in going beyond as well to

99
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,790
look at the potential to write policy

100
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,230
and academic papers that relates this

101
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:21,939
work to to take it outside of this space

102
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,529
the in the past have been some even

103
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,529
multimedia expressions of this there's a

104
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,630
film called the Internet of Rights I

105
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:33,550
believe you can look you can view that

106
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:35,050
at the research group's website and as

107
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,849
well there's been some in the past data

108
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,560
analysis which I think will continue to

109
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,170
have to do to really look at what are

110
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,680
the dynamics in the ITF and how we can

111
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:49,630
learn something from that and of course

112
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,880
we're reviewing protocols as well so

113
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,910
yeah these are the my milestones if you

114
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,019
will so we have the proposal the

115
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:01,329
chartering the film and RFC 80 to 80

116
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,529
those are the main highlights we're

117
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,649
going to have more of those

118
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:08,350
that's time goes on and right now we

119
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,850
have three active drafts which we're

120
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,009
going to talk about today first we're

121
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,959
talking about Association and politics

122
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,399
the first and third one on this slide

123
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,768
and then at the end we're talking about

124
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,569
the guidelines draft we've had other

125
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,399
internet drafts in the past but those

126
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,899
are expired as far as I know so that is

127
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:30,370
where we're at that is the history of HR

128
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:34,899
PC we are now moving into the

129
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,910
presentation by Juan Carlos de Martin so

130
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:40,380
I will give some time for that to get

131
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,380
set up and load the slides

132
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:10,610
in you gamer yes we can him hello

133
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:14,269

137
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,199
been following through the many lists

138
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:26,660
but it was the first time that I

139
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,920
actually interact with all of you I was

140
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,959
supposed to be there in person

141

that thank you for this opportunity to

144
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,569
present remotely just a few words about

145
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,329
me I'm a professor of computer

146
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:47,029
engineering at the Polytechnic of curing

147
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:50,209
and for the past 15 years I've been

148
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:53,660
working studying several topics

149
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:56,209
regarding internet and society with law

150
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,420
professors economists fight also first

151
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:01,219
etc usually in the count within the

152
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,829
context of the Nexus Center for Internet

153
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,959
and Society which I found it also in the

154
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,399
context of the Berkman client center for

155
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,670
Internet and Society at Harvard

156
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,470
University what I would like to share

157
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,729
with you today is our work about

158
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,180
something we called ethically and

159
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:22,449
socially aware data labels next slide

160
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,449
please

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:34,638
okay thank you this what I'm presenting

ambulatory and the publication is

166
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,509
available both on the springer website

167
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,699
and also as open access on the next

168
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:54,819
Center website and you can find their

169
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:54,819
URL over there next slide please

170
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,769
can you see me

171
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,850
yeah there's just a bit of a delay

172
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,360
usually okay IDEs yes and also can you

173
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,910
see the I should also send my own video

174
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,980
but probably is not showing let's try

175
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,600
again

176
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,980
not that this necessary to see my face

177
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,520
but maybe it would be okay I'll proceed

178
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,520
with the slides

179
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,510
okay let me disable the video according

180
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,610
to the instructions I'm receiving

181
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,280
through the chat okay

182
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,890
now the starting point is that we all

183
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,600
know the crucial role of data for the

184
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,370
design and development certainly on

185
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,710
machine learning algorithms but more

186
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:45,100
generally of recommendation systems and

187
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:49,990
many digital systems just to next slide

188
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,570
please just to show a quotation among

189
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,210
many this is taken from the very

190
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:59,260
well-known book by Katie O'Neil weapons

191
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:01,210
of mass destruction example based on one

192
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,280
of the main chapters of the book based

193
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,010
on the admissions by American

194
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,740
universities obviously if we had trained

195
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:12,550
do training on the basis of past data

196
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,130
from the 1960s or 70s we would have of

197
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,890
course a recommendation system or our

198
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,900
enrollment system and that would show

199
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,740
the same biases or the data sets

200
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:26,250
collected regarding those decades next

201
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,250
slide please

202
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,930
now to avoid discrimination and other

203
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,630
unintended negative effects we will

204
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,989
focusing on unintended negative effects

205
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,180
of course care is needed at all stages

206
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,650
of the design and development process of

207
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,319
a machine learning system of a

208
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,060
recommendation system etc I will show

209
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,280
you in a second which stages were

210
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,280
focusing on next slide please

211
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:57,240
we're focusing at the beginning so

212
00:15:53,110 --> 00:16:01,000
upstream the data is produced is

213
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,750
collected afterwards we have a data set

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,060
and this data set is available for use

215
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,890
maybe by organizations and people that

216
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,810
have nothing to do with the organization

217
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,670
that collected the data so we have these

218
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,770
data sets they're coming from somewhere

219
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,589
maybe we don't have any personal

220
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,880
connection or

221
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,370
additional connection with the

222
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,610
collectors so that we just have the data

223
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,920
and this data is used as the primary

224
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,010
input to develop for instance

225
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:32,240
recommendation system and therefore this

226
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:35,900
is where we're focusing next slide so

227
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,480
the key idea which is by the way not

228
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,579
original other people are working also

229
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,150
in the same direction we're just

230
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:47,600
contributing his effort is to support

231
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:50,750
computer scientist using data sets by

232
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,060
means of easy-to-understand labels so or

233
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,480
more broadly in our case easy to

234
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,459
understand the approach to better

235
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,220
understand the implications of the data

236
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,430
sets they're going to use next slide

237
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,430
please

238
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:14,000
more specifically now there is a fairly

239
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:18,200
large body of research showing uncertain

240
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,750
data characteristics may lead sometimes

241
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,569
in wastes are not completely

242
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,300
self-evident or to discriminatory

243
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:28,840
decisions on therefore it is important

244
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,629
to identify those data characteristics

245
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:35,030
and to show the potential risk of those

246
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,690
data characteristics if not understood

247
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,750
in their full implications next slide

248
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,020
please

249
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:47,120
so what we are focusing between step one

250
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,550
and step two so the data sets as I

251
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,659
mentioned had been elected as traveled

252
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,480
who knows where

253
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,520
now's is in the hands of a computer

254
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,460
scientist who wants to use the data set

255
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,940
right at that moment you would like to

256
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:05,150
provide a framework to properly use

257
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,820
those data sets next slide next slide

258
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,660
please

259
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:14,750
so we want to label data sets so the

260
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,700
ultimate ultimate end is as a sort of

261
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:21,470
labels that are easy to understand the

262
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:24,080
quick to to comprehend showing that

263
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,350
certain data characteristics for

264
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,510
instance and even distribution in gender

265
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,389
balance colon arity of a

266
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:35,360
tributes etc we will I will show you

267
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,210
examples in the following slides that

268
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,570
represent a risk of discrimination is

269
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,700
used in decision-making now I want to

270
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,120
stress the word risk in the sense that

271
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,550
we are not sure we are just showing that

272
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,679
there are potential problems with the

273
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,330
data set but maybe there is no problem

274
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,570
at all because maybe the specific

275
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,730
application and the specific data set

276
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,340
actually is perfectly fine the way it is

277
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,170
but we want to raise the flag saying

278
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,540
okay are you aware of that

279
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,370
and if the computer scientist says yes

280
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,070
I'm aware of that and that's perfectly

281
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:17,629
fine for my application then they can go

282
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:19,760
on next slide so the the focus and the

283
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,310
objective is to be useful to software

284
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,240
engineers in order to make them more

285
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:30,200
aware of the potential risk and so if

286
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,880
they as we all hope want to do so to be

287
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,790
able to use the data set in a more

288
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,450
ethical and socially aware manner in

289
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:41,240
addition this approach these labels

290
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,730
could be used by third parties to do

291
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,940
some sort of independent verification we

292
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,980
can also imagine situation where the

293
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,280
data set has been produced it has been

294
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,900
used and then there is a potential third

295
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,720
party which would be could be a public

296
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,810
authority or could be a certificate of

297
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,600
some sort wants to look in the process

298
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:05,030
and this approach can help with a

299
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,810
certificate or to more quickly do its

300
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:11,810
job next slide please

301
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:13,790
now as I mentioned this is with not

302
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,700
claim of originality there are at least

303
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,230
two other initiatives we're aware of

304
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,120
that working in the same direction while

305
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,070
one is the data side nutrition label

306
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,649
project which is a joint project between

307
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:29,230
the media lab at MIT and the Berkman

308
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:32,030
Klein Center at Harvard and another

309
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:36,100
project that is similar is data sheets

310
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:38,590
for data sets by gable and other authors

311
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,409
next slide please

312
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,280
now what in our approach in our proposed

313
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,820
approach we are

314
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,000
three branches three main building

315
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:53,139
blocks and I will show what they are in

316
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,140
a second next slide please

317
00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:00,020
first of all we are going to look about

318
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,679
disproportionate paths so data says that

319
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,900
have features that are disproportionate

320
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,980
next slide please

321
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,750
secondly we are going to look at the

322
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,800
features of the data set that they are

323
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:15,050
correlated or in the extreme case

324
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,180
collinear so essentially a linear

325
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:21,740
combination of other features in data

326
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:23,480
set so we have to warn users look it's a

327
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,590
different feature in the data set but

328
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,970
actually it can be very easily predicted

329
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:32,409
by other features present already

330
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:36,920
present in the data set next slide and

331
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:38,720
third point which has been introduced by

332
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,170
one of the co-authors who is a software

333
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,970
engineer is about data quality and now

334
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:48,170
it's a specific topic which are not

335
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,870
completely familiar which is data

336
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:53,930
quality this quarter which is Antonio

337
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,610
Boudreau who is anti-retro explained us

338
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,200
that there is within the international

339
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,229
standards organization there are two

340
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,660
standards regarding assess the

341
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,360
qualitative a quantitative assessment of

342
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,360
data and therefore he introduced this

343
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,270
third branch third third building block

344
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,229
to assess datasets which is data quality

345
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:19,100
in this specific sense of the Izone

346
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:21,170
standards and which are articulated into

347
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,179
five quality dimensions which are

348
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,090
accuracy completeness consistency

349
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,220
credibility and currentness next slide

350
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:32,320
please

351
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:35,630
now having brought together these three

352
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,840
building blocks we wanted to test them

353
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:43,070
to do an experimenter to do an exercise

354
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,889
with a specific data set well known in

355
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,280
the studies of this this kind of problem

356
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:51,410
so next slide please

357
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,800
it's the data sink called critic credit

358
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,169
core default there is information in

359
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,918
this data set on default payments

360
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:04,379
of credit cards in Taiwan from April to

361
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,990
September 2005 and in these data sets

362
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:09,570
you find demographic factors like the

363
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,269
age of the person create data

364
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,759
information history of payment and build

365
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,799
statements of credit card clients so

366
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,080
there is a various number of all

367
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,960
features and some of them are critical

368
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,439
in the sense that I mentioned before

369
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:28,200
next slide please

370
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,570
for instance the data set do not cannot

371
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,749
contain the protected attributes race

372
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:37,019
ethnicity but contains which we know of

373
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:39,450
course it's a very sensitive feature but

374
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:42,990
contains other personal information that

375
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:46,019
can be used in a discriminatory way if

376
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,179
apply to assess creditworthiness for

377
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,580
instance gender our level of education

378
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,309
so let's dig a little deeper and see

379
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,309
what we found looking at this data set

380
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:57,450
next slide please

381
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:02,210
now let's look at the first one this

382
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:06,570
proportion at nasse please next slide

383
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:09,029
for instance very simple factor age we

384
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:14,700
see that this and the histogram of age

385
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:16,799
of very easy to to plot this feature we

386
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,350
see that there is a high prevalence of

387
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:24,690
young people between the age of 25 and

388
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:27,389
40 now the objective of showing the user

389
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,889
that data set this information is just

390
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:30,869
it's not to tell them there's something

391
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:32,969
wrong with this we don't know if there's

392
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:36,240
something wrong we're just saying this

393
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,909
is the age profile make sure implicitly

394
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,220
we are saying make sure that whatever

395
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:43,559
you want to do with this data set you're

396
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,539
okay with this age profile is it

397
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:48,418
representative of the people in Taiwan

398
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:51,749
is it representative of credit card

399
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:55,440
owners in Taiwan is it okay for your

400
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:58,200
application so we're just making clear

401
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,119
that this is the profile and you may be

402
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:05,970
okay or maybe not next slide please

403
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:08,580
now again looking at features that we

404
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,440
know can have potential implications for

405
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,770
discrimination for instance

406
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,670
we're saying 60% of the people in this

407
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:21,780
database are women almost half of them

408
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:23,280
attended college and we have more or

409
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:27,260
less than half and half split between

410
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:30,600
single people and married people again

411
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:34,500
we know that all these features level of

412
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,480
education gender and marital status can

413
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,570
have implications can be potentially

414
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,660
discriminatory if not used properly and

415
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,730
so we are showing the use of data set

416
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,340
this is the way it is in this data set

417
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,800
don't use it blindly because if you use

418
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,840
it bland we think it is a representative

419
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,330
of the general population maybe you're

420
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,879
going to produce unintended consequences

421
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,879
in your system next slide please

422
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:07,230
Croatian culinary team next slide now

423
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,650
looking at the features within data set

424
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:13,560
we found very significant correlations

425
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,570
between the condition of payment default

426
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:20,270
so somebody didn't pay the credit card

427
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:23,389
bills and their level of education so

428
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:27,570
their gender and their marital status

429
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:30,750
again these three dis correlations are

430
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:32,250
not surprising because for instance if

431
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,470
you look at the level of education you

432
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,960
see that the higher the level of

433
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:41,090
education the lower is the likelihood of

434
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,800
a payment default which is intuitive

435
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,840
considering all other whatever

436
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,100
everything we know about what is

437
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,760
correlated with a high level of

438
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,110
education but we're making

439
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,540
straightforward easy to understand for

440
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:57,000
the data set user saying if you're

441
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,280
looking beware if you're for instance

442
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,430
using the marital status or the level of

443
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,879
education and you're using it using it

444
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:08,490
without being aware that it's a highly

445
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,860
correlated in one way or another with

446
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,720
the payment default beware because you

447
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,270
might get something that you actually is

448
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,260
not what you wanted next slide please

449
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,900
finally that the quality I will only

450
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,059
mention that applying the two ISO

451
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,249
standards I mentioned before at

452
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,200
you can only apply 2 or the five

453
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:31,169
attributes accuracy and completeness

454
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,779
which are actually quite good for this

455
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:38,700
specific data size

456
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:42,080
next slide please I conclude so this

457
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:46,019
approach which is easily understood it

458
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,939
is a proposal of how to address data

459
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,879
sets and then produce actually

460
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,590
graphically appealing labels like the

461
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:55,379
two other projects that I mentioned are

462
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,149
working on could help datasets user to

463
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:59,339
be more aware of the potential biases

464
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:02,099
and problems of the data set before

465
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:04,859
using them so the moment they acquired

466
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:07,049
this data set they are helped they are

467
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,939
supported in understanding the

468
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:10,799
implication at least some of them

469
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,639
because of course some implications are

470
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,710
difficult to to assess exactly but

471
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:18,748
assemble them therefore reducing the

472
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:27,179
risk of downstreams unintended problems

473
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:29,339
also for human rights thank you thanks

474
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:34,399
very much are there going to be

475
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:37,399
questions people want to queue is

476
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,928
labeling data in this way not

477
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:42,748
potentially likely to make it even

478
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,570
easier to discriminate and if you say

479
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:51,059
are we found like 15 colon ii-era T's

480
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:52,889
between LGBTQ people and but no credit

481
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,950
card defaults you could then apply that

482
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:57,559
to learn from other data and reveal

483
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,869
perhaps privacy information about people

484
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:03,389
through labeling this data in this way

485
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:07,259
that's that's why I used so many times

486
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:09,330
the objective unintended because we are

487
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,999
assuming that the data users is in good

488
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:15,809
faith and so we are helping a good faith

489
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:17,339
data user if it's not in good faith so

490
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:20,070
if the intention is actually to

491
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:22,950
discriminate sure this approach could be

492
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:25,499
helpful but if it's in bad faith they

493
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,960
could do what we're doing anyway and so

494
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:34,529
we would they would reach the same

495
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:36,899
result with a little more effort the

496
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:38,480
sorry Jonathan Ireland I didn't say my

497
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,919
name

498
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,260
making it easier for people to do bad

499
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:49,470
things tends to make people do more bad

500
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:51,990
things oh oh well actually a warning

501
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,780
sign saying that be careful this could

502
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:57,960
lead to bad consequences I don't see it

503
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:02,309
as really conducive to doing bad things

504
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,980
I cannot I mean otherwise the other turn

505
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,720
ative is just obscurity so trying to

506
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:12,620
reach security by making things

507
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:15,150
difficult to understand for example

508
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,620
making sure the published data sets with

509
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:22,140
enough noise to break the sky linearity

510
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:26,479
I'm sure I don't understand if there is

511
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,480
a collinearity adding the noise and

512
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,720
adding the noise could mask the car

513
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,770
linearity by making by breaking

514
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,470
correlation effectively oh well if the

515
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:44,540
noise is white it's so easy to filter

516
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:53,700
out and find out the colinearity anyway

517
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:56,730
just out of the top of my head different

518
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,880
question my name is Joe hall from CDT in

519
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:04,290
the US DARPA DARPA right Defense

520
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,059
Advanced Research they have a version of

521
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,889
Android they've been working on for a

522
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:10,590
long time now for five years that's

523
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,929
called privacy enhanced Android and it

524
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:15,840
does some of this tagging especially in

525
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:18,300
the developer level like developers

526
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,520
using this as far as I understand it I

527
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,540
don't understand it very well

528
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,030
developers using this kind of a

529
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,940
framework can sort of talk about

530
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,740
intentions and pre label certain kinds

531
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,210
of sensor data and stuff like that

532
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,630
wondering if you've thought about sort

533
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:36,059
of bringing this down to that kind of

534
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,070
level maybe modifying this privacy

535
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,270
enhance Android to also not just be

536
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,689
about privacy but the things you're

537
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:46,170
talking about sort of a richer form of

538
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:47,400
intentional labeling of flows in objects

539
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,110
and stuff now thank you this is a very

540
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,650
good suggestion we would look into that

541
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,649
thank you

542
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:03,340
anyone in the queue remotely doesn't

543
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:03,340
look like it thank you

544
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:19,360
okay um so yeah Joe and Stefan we're

545
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:29,000
going to talk about draft Association I

546
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:48,379
think so let's Jack you have 15 minutes

547
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:51,470
correct all right let's do this

548
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,600
so Stefan are here is the violin I are

549
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,919
here to talk about draft Association we

550
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,750
haven't modified the document at all

551
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,870
which some of you might be like wait

552
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:02,169
that was your whole job but we wanted to

553
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:05,418
put forward some very specific deep

554
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:07,340
changes that might deserve some

555
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,570
discussion and then we'll take it from

556
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,039
the list and then actually modify the

557
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:14,889
document within about a month maybe a

558
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:18,980
little longer do you want to do your

559
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:21,020
yeah so yeah i'm stefan cultura I'm not

560
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,150
your converse t soon to be moving at

561
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,400
investor Maya so I'm trying to continue

562
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:28,400
to this draft but I'm also a

563
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,409
communication scholar as part of my

564
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,010
research trying to understand what's

565
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:35,870
going on in ITF and like people discuss

566
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:38,480
about values in attic so if you have

567
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:42,350
question about my research please come

568
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:46,520
to me after so Petrelli he's studying us

569
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:48,350
you're now made aware of that deal with

570
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,840
it

571
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,520
cheers thanks next slide just to give

572
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,809
you a quick little background draft

573
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,270
Association is one of the specific

574
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:58,309
rights that flows from 80 to 80 and

575
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,530
specific to Association assembly we took

576
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:03,168
the helm of this after kneels and

577
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,550
Gizella handed it off to us it feels

578
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:06,500
like it's maybe 75

579
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,750
done and apologies if I'm talking too

580
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,040
quickly we don't have a lot of time and

581
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,270
what we want to do is actually run

582
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:18,320
through some of the bigger thoughts we

583
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:20,360
had right now so just a recap of the

584
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,850
giraffe for those who didn't read it so

585
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,280
the research question it's centered

586
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,469
about a research question the research

587
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,590
question is others they architecture of

588
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:32,270
the Internet enable and/or animate the

589
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:35,300
right to freedom of assembly and

590
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:38,500
Association the mythology that is stated

591
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:42,530
in the giraffe is to test the casual

592
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:45,860
relationship a formulation we which we

593
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:49,520
will come back to it and so basically

594
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:52,940
our protocol calls the capacity to

595
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,030
associate or assembly true okay section

596
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,610
there's basically seven protocol cases

597
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,010
that are address in the giraffe so you

598
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:03,890
have the table of content here and you

599
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:06,830
have like cases of a like conversing

600
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,740
cases peer-to-peer networks and system

601
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:13,270
and grouping together here so mailing

602
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:16,279
lists multi-party video conferencing

603
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:18,920
Internet Relay Chat peer-to-peer system

604
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:23,720
version control DNS anatomist system and

605
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:26,960
our each of these case can have

606
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:30,770
potential - yeah

607
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:37,310
- to facilitate or constrain association

608
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:38,900
and assembly so the first big question

609
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:50,110
we have is this draft talks about

610
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:52,640
causality I'm a physicist I was ok yeah

611
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:55,700
yeah we had a question because the

612
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,370
mythology is based like the goal is to

613
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,290
establish a causality so there was this

614
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:02,540
some discussions like in the mailing

615
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:06,230
list by different people who brought

616
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:09,410
this and like it's a strong objective

617
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:12,140
causality to establish like our protocol

618
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,140
calls Association and something within

619
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:18,420
the giraffe of the draft for like 80 to

620
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:21,089
80 actually was no mention of causality

621
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,819
and also like the idea that technology

622
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:27,808
is causing stuff has been a bit more

623
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:30,660
neurons true studies for instance in STS

624
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:32,640
and communication dry famine ISM for

625
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,058
instance they talk about how the main

626
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,210
pack which is a bit less ambitious and

627
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:42,599
we don't see causality as a major

628
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,789
element yet so we would like to drop

629
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,099
like the idea of causality and maybe

630
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:50,309
replace it by something a bit more

631
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:53,250
neurons but at the same time in a way to

632
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:55,829
show that the protocols can have an

633
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,490
impact but although there are other

634
00:36:55,829 --> 00:37:01,740
dimensions and a ways also to circumvent

635
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:04,589
these things but there's a relation but

636
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:08,250
made me baby not causal so that's a

637
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:14,220
question maybe you can answer about this

638
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:19,200
after or in the always in there yeah and

639
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:27,538
then the second one do it do it thank

640
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:29,788
you second one is the church the cases

641
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:31,049
that are chosen right there's ones that

642
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,940
are about communication

643
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:35,250
the conversing one there's one's about

644
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,950
object or file transfer sharing stuff

645
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,539
that's peer-to-peer versioning then

646
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,460
there's stuff about identity DNS

647
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:42,839
autonomous systems but it strikes us

648
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,000
that there's other things and maybe

649
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:48,240
these were left out and we just couldn't

650
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,740
find a record of that for example app

651
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,848
stores can propose pretty significant

652
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,038
restrictions on the ability to associate

653
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:59,039
by removing apps that millions of people

654
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,940
use maybe that's not an IETF thing or

655
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,960
that's not something that we need to

656
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,140
care about because that's not about

657
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,240
protocols otherwise you know think about

658
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,650
things like SMS right that's I don't

659
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,250
know if that's an HF vertical I don't

660
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,319
think so

661
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,750
I think that might be ITU something else

662
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:14,308
what I don't even know but these things

663
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,289
you know like the vert the difference

664
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:18,029
between SMS and more modern kinds of

665
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:21,029
messaging systems they do have impacts

666
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:22,829
on assembly I'm not sure if we want to

667
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:25,140
talk about that in this draft or what

668
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:28,019
we'll have a more fulsome discussion on

669
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,160
the list but and for example we talked

670
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:33,819
about all these proprietary non Interop

671
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,558
Oh messaging systems bye neighbor we

672
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:39,099
don't talk about signal which is maybe

673
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,660
one of the biggest proprietary non

674
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:42,490
interoperable systems I mean it's it's

675
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,500
it's I guess I can't say proprietary

676
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,359
because it's it's free software but

677
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,289
still you can interoperate with it good

678
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,308
luck

679
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:53,109
and then we're wondering if there are if

680
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:55,240
there are sort of longitudinal cases we

681
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:57,279
can describe that might help folks

682
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,049
for example turkey is a really

683
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:01,990
interesting case where the government

684
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:03,430
used DNS blocking and then you may have

685
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,379
seen pictures of and you may have seen

686
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:09,190
me present pictures of this of people

687
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:12,160
spray-painting 8.88 well no one no one

688
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,809
now or whatever but then what happened

689
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,788
was when the government realized that

690
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,210
their orders to ISPs were not being as

691
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:20,650
effective it went to a higher level of

692
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:21,940
an effect on their associational right

693
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,460
so they started doing internal

694
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,720
adversarial BGP route announcements for

695
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,140
certain kinds of things like Twitter

696
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,759
right and in those cases you know that

697
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:35,500
kind of an interplay that kind of a

698
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:37,599
longitudinal disruption on freedoms of

699
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,130
Association and assembly specifically in

700
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,559
those cases that might be a good thing

701
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:46,230
to include in this there other things

702
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:48,190
like Molly Sauter has a great book about

703
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,769
distributed denial services as a

704
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,660
legitimate form of protest that you know

705
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:55,058
in the digital world we haven't created

706
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:58,180
the sidewalks that people use in the

707
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,769
physical world to be able to protest so

708
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,049
that we have to do these things like

709
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:04,000
DDoS if we want to be activists and

710
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:07,329
disrupt things there's just no other

711
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,559
alternative and then I forgot the

712
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:13,170
gentleman's name but this morning we

713
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:16,029
talked about the relationship Leandre

714
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:19,539
we're talking about the relationships

715
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:22,480
between small independent nonprofit

716
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:25,960
providers of things like email and the

717
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,670
large huge email systems like Gmail and

718
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,849
Facebook and stuff like that and how it

719
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,529
can be extremely hard to get them to

720
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,000
accept your email and then when they

721
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:35,470
don't it's very hard to figure out

722
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,329
exactly why they didn't accept your

723
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:41,308
email and that obviously is going to

724
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:41,309
pose some restrictions on Association

725
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,479
yeah I wanted to add so just from my

726
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:50,538
understand maybe Leon who could take the

727
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:52,279
mic after this but the idea the last one

728
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:55,309
might be more about like spamming

729
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:57,979
protocols so let's say you use like a

730
00:40:55,309 --> 00:41:01,089
rise up email you send it to Gmail and

731
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:05,269
Gmail consider it's a spam so this might

732
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:09,140
cut off the capacity to assembly between

733
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:12,558
activists so that's that might be a use

734
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:15,200
case the section we put that the lasas

735
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:19,640
is like should we because the the the

736
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,410
the the the draft is Center much are

737
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,700
around technologies but we were

738
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:28,940
wondering if we should start with like

739
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,700
case like good examples on our social

740
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,130
examples or it was made and then go on

741
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,828
with the specific case of existing

742
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:44,109
technologies so we open up this as a

743
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:47,660
question the last next line yeah another

744
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:51,109
question Association on propriety

745
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:54,049
platforms and we felt that the graph is

746
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:57,680
implicitly critical of large propriety

747
00:41:54,049 --> 00:42:00,430
we and are not entered and so we I this

748
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,328
word I have this word platforms

749
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:08,419
especially search such as major social

750
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:10,400
media platform so it's not very explicit

751
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,369
about this but there are son sentence

752
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,269
especially at the end they say basic

753
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:20,380
here open an open platform open protocol

754
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:23,419
will favor more Association than a

755
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,459
propriety platform on the other hand we

756
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,499
cannot deny that social media like

757
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:31,339
Facebook and Twitter day they are

758
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:33,700
helpful platform for Association so we

759
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:36,910
know like

760
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:40,779
we know many activists we put Twitter

761
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:42,578
revolution between coats yeah but it has

762
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:44,230
been criticized but it's been used by

763
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:47,380
many social movements as a way to

764
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:50,140
associate so I think we need to take

765
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,200
this into account on the other Anna

766
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:59,348
actually what problem might be that

767
00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:03,879
Facebook as a or social medias like like

768
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:07,059
a lot of power bi like this I see 18

769
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:12,849
people okay without it's not like it's

770
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:17,440
not regulated as as it is like in in in

771
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:19,720
the public space okay so yeah so at the

772
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,170
end it's part its talk about the forest

773
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:26,169
Association so social media is talking

774
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:28,869
about forcing the association of people

775
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:31,750
but we were wondering if we could talk

776
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:35,109
about freedom of association let's say

777
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:37,089
can we discuss it them yourself from

778
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:43,630
social media so it might be another way

779
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:47,109
to frame the discussion thanks like okay

780
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:49,750
so the last question is more about the

781
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:51,880
HR PC work it's something I thought this

782
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,759
morning so maybe we could think about

783
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,450
with our audience who we have the idea

784
00:43:54,759 --> 00:44:01,089
that we want to convince her to to talk

785
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,009
with engineers but these documents are

786
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:04,869
they also attract social activists and

787
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:07,509
social science academics who get

788
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:11,559
interested by ITF and may later

789
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:13,509
influence it so in all the writing this

790
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,460
we might think as like you are we

791
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:18,460
talking are we talking only our to the

792
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:21,670
folks in ITF are we talking to other

793
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,710
people also true these documentation so

794
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:28,240
it's not specific to this but it might

795
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:29,319
be a general question for HR PC this is

796
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,180
our last night sorry

797
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:32,529
so there's a number of minor change

798
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,078
changes we wanted to mention during our

799
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:37,390
presentation after each case there's

800
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:39,730
sort of this - - list of a - any

801
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,348
considerations it's kind of mysterious

802
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,089
where that comes from

803
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:44,109
I mean you can point to 80 to 80 but

804
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:46,390
we're gonna do some things that

805
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:47,130
basically clean that up to add sentences

806
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,930
and content

807
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:52,359
you know make it less of a list and more

808
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:55,390
of a narrative or something that isn't

809
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:57,038
as mysterious to the readers we also you

810
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,348
know right now the document isn't very

811
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:02,440
clear on how these cases were chosen it

812
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:04,539
uses some some words like these are you

813
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,079
know typicality and a paradigmatic

814
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:09,819
nature of the cases but we're gonna find

815
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,329
ways to talk about the cases we talked

816
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:15,009
about so where it makes a little more

817
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:16,329
coherent sense across all the cases and

818
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:17,890
it's going to include maybe including

819
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:21,369
new ones maybe dropping some of the ones

820
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:23,799
we have now again will propose this on

821
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:26,259
the list and have either pull requests

822
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:28,420
or text changes that you guys can look

823
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:30,009
at finally there's a section in section

824
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,680
7 that talks about legal limitations

825
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:34,420
that you know only lawful limitations on

826
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,489
rights are allowed and yeah that's true

827
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,140
of governments that have signed human

828
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:41,009
rights treaties and feel free to to take

829
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:44,618
issue with this but it doesn't apply to

830
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:45,910
businesses and so it's sort of a half of

831
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:48,369
lawyer what I want to do with this

832
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,859
section is take it and and one make it

833
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:52,299
not as normative you know this really

834
00:45:50,859 --> 00:45:54,160
needs to be a descriptive document I

835
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:57,519
think right listen totally missed what

836
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,430
we're doing here but then sort of talk

837
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,988
about change it lists talking about

838
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,219
granted in treaties and we'll ground it

839
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:05,049
in treaties for governments but then

840
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:06,609
talk about business social

841
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:09,549
responsibility is the thing that's a

842
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:12,249
hook for why businesses care about human

843
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:17,380
rights in many cases and that's it sorry

844
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:19,629
to be so long thank you thank you guys

845
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,920
please let's queue up you guys have post

846
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,440
a lot of really important questions I

847
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,969
think and it would be great - yes for

848
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,009
sure discuss this on the list but if

849
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:28,749
there are thoughts I have a whole list I

850
00:46:27,009 --> 00:46:34,239
don't want to just sit here and talk

851
00:46:28,749 --> 00:46:35,729
move three of us so if great meals this

852
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,059
year

853
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:39,058
go ahead meals

854
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:49,900
you hear me hello hi this is great

855
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:52,000
thanks Joe and Stefan so much for doing

856
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,820
this terrific work on this which was

857
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,750
much needed and I'm highly indepted and

858
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:01,720
again happy to help where I can add some

859
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:04,000
clarifications app stores and platforms

860
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,620
we tried to keep outside of the draft

861
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,790
because it got outside of the remit of

862
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:12,430
the IETF I re i RTF and we try to catch

863
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:15,580
that with the sentence architecture in

864
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:18,700
the in the research question by trying

865
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:20,440
to limit the scope of it a bit going

866
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:24,580
beyond that might make the work a bit

867
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,560
unwieldy another point is that in your

868
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:31,259
discussions we talked about the book by

869
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:35,230
Molly Sauter we also had a Molly Sauter

870
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:38,410
respond to the list and so we discussed

871
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:40,170
there if whether ddos could be a

872
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,370
positive freedom of expression and that

873
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,230
discussion then ended which can of

874
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,120
course be in the found in the archives

875
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,130
but it was an extensive discussion that

876
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,810
an attack is an attack is an attack is

877
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:54,340
an attack and and then we are we achieve

878
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,440
achieved actually a research group

879
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,780
consensus on that so I'm not sure

880
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,850
whether you would really to go down the

881
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:07,200
rabbit hole at least before having a

882
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:10,110
look at that at the description again so

883
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:13,270
thanks a lot for this I do agree that

884
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:16,900
Kinsella tea might might be a bit strong

885
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:18,700
even though I do not think that the the

886
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,500
current document is technological

887
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:25,240
deterministic because the protocol is

888
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:27,040
not so understood as as as technological

889
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,410
but as an assemblage but I'm very

890
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,720
curious to be what the new editors will

891
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,980
come up with with the nature of the

892
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,870
relationships thanks so much for word

893
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,280
thanks

894
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:41,200
yeah I would just pick it back up on a

895
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,360
couple of those comments so I as well

896
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,890
remember the DDoS discussion because I

897
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,630
disagreed with Molly's book I mean it's

898
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,009
an interesting book I think she poses a

899
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,530
lot of interesting things but I think to

900
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,060
say that DDoS is a print is protected

901
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,160
because it's Association I think

902
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,660
is a stretch and also within this

903
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,089
context I think it's important to

904
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:03,790
remember what the mission of IETF is and

905
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:06,490
what I RTF is and to understand that

906
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:10,029
it's important to have a very solid base

907
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:11,410
for using the internet and DDoS is like

908
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,970
exposing vulnerabilities and like

909
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,470
explaining them and I think that's not

910
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:17,290
the role here like if people want to

911
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:19,240
still do that with like you know that's

912
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:22,420
fine but we're not gonna sanction it

913
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,680
necessarily the other one that is real

914
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,960
quick yeah yeah sure I think we weren't

915
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,419
gonna like sanction it's more like using

916
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,520
that as a way to discuss you know how

917
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,170
limiting the digital environment is

918
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,730
before jumping into the cases so not

919
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,500
endorsing it by using it as sort of

920
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,360
something a discussion point that might

921
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,720
help people understand where we're

922
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,650
coming

923
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:43,689
yeah I mean not even yeah I mean yeah I

924
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:48,040
think it would be actually useful to

925
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:50,290
just go back to the list to do 2016 yeah

926
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,380
it's um it's in there for sure um the

927
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:56,830
other one that Neil's mentioned is about

928
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:58,540
the like keeping the app store and those

929
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:00,819
out I mean one thing that occurred to me

930
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,770
was it could be similar to like browser

931
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,830
extensions which is a little bit closer

932
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:10,420
to IDF but still not quite that's one

933
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:11,740
thing you could maybe consider um yeah

934
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,260
and then just the last thing I'll say

935
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,089
and then I'll take a pause for Holy

936
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,010
Ana's comment it's just that I would

937
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,810
really support inclusion of signal

938
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:23,130
especially because we have MLS and so it

939
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:25,090
can be a useful case study in the

940
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:27,520
spectrum of the case studies you have

941
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,530
because many of them like if we talking

942
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,940
about email like okay there's maybe some

943
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:33,460
changes to email but it's mostly done in

944
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,750
dust it's a historical view but you can

945
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:37,630
also then look at things that are in

946
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:39,070
situ and that could be one also that

947
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:49,300
could be interesting for that reason

948
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:55,590
Juliana which was i yes about the vxr8

949
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:55,590
format no the next just for questions

950
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:05,890
about the question about using Aris RFC

951
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:08,800
format to both audience I think it is

952
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:11,529
really important to use RFC format until

953
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,900
how to write this format because we have

954
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:18,010
more experience like talking about

955
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:22,210
technology without completely understand

956
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:25,060
how does it work to the public now to

957
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:28,230
grow their audience so it is necessary

958
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:32,710
to the same question I do to myself

959
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:36,190
writing the feminist dropped and this is

960
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:39,640
about like I'm not sure if I understood

961
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:42,820
our nails but the every question is like

962
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:45,490
we are talking about end users ever I

963
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:47,770
think while we're talking about human

964
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:50,709
rights we are ever talking about end

965
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:54,160
users and here sometimes people don't

966
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:57,370
think they are talking to end users so

967
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,850
we need to find the way to translate

968
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:03,490
that in terms of protocols so I think

969
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:08,020
that's very important and that's what we

970
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:13,359
have to explore and find the way thank

971
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:17,020
you my last comment I think for now is

972
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:20,350
just the you mentioned business and

973
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,200
human rights yeah I think it's a really

974
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:24,400
important point I also wonder I mean if

975
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,120
I'm are calling right that is also

976
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,520
considered in the in 80 to 80 so maybe

977
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,810
it's worth also just trying to see

978
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,150
what's been discussed before because

979
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:37,390
like in deeds right like Human Rights is

980
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:40,000
an obligation of states not companies

981
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,440
but of course we think about your best

982
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,720
practice for companies and like

983
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,300
encouraging them you know whatever so I

984
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,370
I wonder if we can do our best to either

985
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,890
not just maybe mirror what's already

986
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:52,839
there but even improve that language a

987
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,410
bit because of your experience and your

988
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:59,320
thoughts on that

989
00:52:53,410 --> 00:53:05,410
that'd be great yep Leandra you can see

990
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:13,570
or see this is a comment when when we

991
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:17,230
talk about the the right of assembly or

992
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:20,320
or or association we mentioned this

993
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:21,980
money in the case of him a well I mean

994
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,690
it's an example where is of

995
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,430
a few applications well you have local

996
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:28,490
herbal accents global interoperability

997
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:32,990
of the racial across small and large

998
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:35,270
email operators but but sometimes it's

999
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,910
not enough and you need some kind of

1000
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:42,320
centralized governance some kind of ways

1001
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:43,730
to address the problems that appear not

1002
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:49,010
in a particular way for each provider

1003
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:51,560
but across providers and and well or

1004
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:54,050
even in imagine like the case of instant

1005
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,480
messages and applications where it used

1006
00:53:54,050 --> 00:54:01,040
to be inter some hunter interoperable

1007
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:03,380
but the the attitude of providers became

1008
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,259
like well let's isolate users so

1009
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:07,160
nowadays when you want to associate

1010
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:09,560
without people you need to agree on

1011
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,069
which application you're going to use to

1012
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:14,930
do that

1013
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:18,800
so I mean it's I like very much the work

1014
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:22,339
that because the technical problems of

1015
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:25,609
of federated systems or globally

1016
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:28,720
addressable systems translates into this

1017
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:33,020
freedom of association or or assembly

1018
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:38,000
awesome force people that participate in

1019
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:39,619
governance can we thank you yeah thanks

1020
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,960
so much yeah looking for journalists

1021
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:44,300
discussion about this and just last

1022
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,800
question on and maybe you said that's in

1023
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,630
the beginning I've just forgotten but do

1024
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:54,680
you have like a kind of ETA when you'll

1025
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:56,780
see that maybe a little ambitious but I

1026
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,149
think about a month is when we hope to

1027
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:01,430
come up with the next - oh three and

1028
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,480
probably a set of things to the to the

1029
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:04,509
mailing list they're going to be like

1030
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,190
here are some things that are clearly

1031
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:09,980
not necessarily done yet that we want to

1032
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,690
you know notify for you and then point

1033
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,300
to things that we've done that you might

1034
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:15,770
want to interrogate yourselves well

1035
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:21,980
it'll be oh three but it's not going to

1036
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:23,880
be done a month roughly sounds good

1037
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,719
thank you guys thanks love

1038
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,719
[Music]

1039
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:42,210
all right so I think nails you're

1040
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,210
presenting remotely on this one

1041
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,080
if you're talking we can't hear you

1042
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:12,280
are you yes we can hear you it's quite

1043
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:14,050
loud but it's good hi okay I'll try to

1044
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,730
put it down I was dropped of course it

1045
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:17,830
just at the moment I started presenting

1046
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:20,920
but I'll keep it short I got three

1047
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:23,440
slides so first slide please

1048
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,720
so this is the draft political we've

1049
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,190
been talking about it for a bit but I

1050
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,500
think what just happened really

1051
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:33,040
Illustrated very well what this draft

1052
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,330
aims to do namely documenting some of

1053
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,720
the discussions that we've been having

1054
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:40,000
and that also keep on coming back so

1055
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,189
it's also like creating a bit of a

1056
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,560
platform on the things we learned

1057
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,390
together so we can continue discussing

1058
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,270
them and learn from our past and

1059
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:51,910
progress at the same time next slide

1060
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:54,970
please second slide so what trying to do

1061
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,359
in draft political is document a long

1062
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,509
list

1063
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,070
standing discussion in HR PC capture

1064
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:02,950
some of the observations and conclusions

1065
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:04,990
we've made a document positions in the

1066
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,399
community document the positions that

1067
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,399
have been discussed in a scientific

1068
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,410
literature on this topic and provide a

1069
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,990
platform to further the discussion

1070
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:16,390
without continuously having to repeat it

1071
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:20,009
so it's also like documenting what we've

1072
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:23,279
been doing but we're not trying to do is

1073
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:26,170
trying to discuss everything possible or

1074
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,970
this provide new guidelines or

1075
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:32,350
considerations because that what we're

1076
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:34,629
doing in other documents so what I've

1077
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:38,069
been doing in the last two versions

1078
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:42,670
since last meeting that I've presented

1079
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:44,830
integrate the very generous review by

1080
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,450
Michael Rogers which was very extensive

1081
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:49,600
and came up with a lot of changes as

1082
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:53,740
well the great review but Julia Gareth

1083
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:55,900
thanks so much for doing that Julia and

1084
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:57,669
and then a conclusion of previous

1085
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:02,530
meeting as many of you will remember was

1086
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:05,080
try to do less and try to make it more

1087
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,330
concrete and try to stay away from

1088
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,520
anything especially

1089
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,960
and try to make it as concrete and

1090
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,450
observable as possible and that's what I

1091
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,490
try to do so I've done that by

1092
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:17,819
simplifying the research question

1093
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:20,430
removing recommendations a removing

1094
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,680
secondary or indirect arguments for

1095
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,490
instance about the IITs financial

1096
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:29,399
position about interoperability and

1097
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:32,669
about layer competition those were

1098
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,610
interesting arguments that in that were

1099
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:39,330
related to the to the research question

1100
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:41,700
but not necessary to answer them so I

1101
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:44,069
remove them that also allowed me to

1102
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,319
create a new shorter clearer abstract

1103
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:47,760
remove definitions of protocols or

1104
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,550
standards because those were not needed

1105
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:54,630
added methodology text to make it more

1106
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:57,930
tight and cleaned up many typos so

1107
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:01,290
that's where we are with 0-3 I think

1108
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:03,690
what we have now seems is much tighter

1109
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:06,180
than what we had and I'm very curious to

1110
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,490
hear from people where they think the

1111
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:15,290
document is at the moment

1112
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:17,970
thanks.thanks meals

1113
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:22,580
yeah I'd also love to hear from folks

1114
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:22,580
about where they think this draft is at

1115
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:27,780
just could you talk a little bit about

1116
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:29,310
the recent discussion we've had on the

1117
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,610
list Neil's because I think that came

1118
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:35,279
after this version and just wondering if

1119
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,230
you can go through if there are any of

1120
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,340
those any of those points in the

1121
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,660
discussion that you think you might

1122
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,210
actually take on board for another

1123
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,319
version or if you've been satisfied with

1124
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:45,300
the discussion you're not going to make

1125
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,920
changes I can see that going both ways

1126
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:50,370
but just wondering your opinion on that

1127
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:53,940
well I think that the discussion on the

1128
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:55,830
list came in response to a discussion it

1129
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,630
came in response to a new version of

1130
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:01,049
this draft but we're not about this

1131
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:05,700
draft so whereas it was a interesting

1132
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:07,590
discussion only one remark was by was

1133
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:10,350
about a draft which was from Andrew

1134
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:13,730
Sullivan and he said that he said there

1135
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:18,620
might be some internal consistency

1136
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:21,329
issues with one view that was portrayed

1137
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:24,328
but that

1138
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:25,799
but we didn't try to judge the positions

1139
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,779
because these were positions that were

1140
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:32,038
observed on the list and during

1141
01:00:27,779 --> 01:00:33,479
interviews and and at meetings so so I

1142
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:35,729
try to answer that and I didn't hear

1143
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:38,759
back from Andrew on that so so I think

1144
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:41,308
with that the discussion was captured as

1145
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:45,089
as far as possible but I'm very happy to

1146
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:46,739
be told I'm wrong okay no that was

1147
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:48,390
really helpful to note I also got a

1148
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:49,529
sense that the conversation was a bit

1149
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:52,170
all over the place and was not

1150
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:54,960
necessarily about the most current

1151
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:57,960
version so it sounds like you don't

1152
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,210
anticipate any further changes based on

1153
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,369
them based on that list discussion and

1154
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:04,650
then oh and I went through all that and

1155
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:06,869
I try to I I was very eager to make

1156
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:08,759
changes but I did I didn't find anything

1157
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:11,849
so so so I'm very curious to hear from

1158
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:14,309
the room others of what we can do to

1159
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:15,749
take this document for yeah I agree I'd

1160
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:19,309
like to hear that too

1161
01:01:15,749 --> 01:01:19,308
okay looks like I was going to the mic

1162
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:24,029
Johanna sweetie

1163
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:26,130
I want to give it one that last read but

1164
01:01:24,029 --> 01:01:27,150
I really like what you've done I don't

1165
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,890
have particularly good thoughts about

1166
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:31,710
what to do next other than working group

1167
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:33,779
last call others may feel differently I

1168
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:39,559
would like to give it one quick review I

1169
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:44,729
could do that this week thank you Joe

1170
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:47,339
thanks Joe hello Gosha with Grover CS so

1171
01:01:44,729 --> 01:01:50,189
just following up on Andrews comment on

1172
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:52,828
the mailing list do you think it's in

1173
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:56,880
the scope of the graph to analyze the

1174
01:01:52,829 --> 01:02:00,630
positions presented by the ietf i RTF

1175
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:03,210
community or do you think that's how the

1176
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:04,819
scope because in a way the draft

1177
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:08,640
currently does do that

1178
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:10,400
by by lumping together at least in four

1179
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,589
five categories the thoughts and

1180
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:17,460
coupling them with literature on the

1181
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:19,769
topic but I think when when people

1182
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:21,960
answer the question are net-like

1183
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:24,779
protocols political they're evening

1184
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,779
they're either answering the question or

1185
01:02:24,779 --> 01:02:30,869
the process is political are the results

1186
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:34,670
political but I mean this might be a

1187
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:34,670
difference in semantics here

1188
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:41,930
that's it that's a really great question

1189
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:45,650
Gershon but I think there are there are

1190
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:51,169
two parts I think the what we try to do

1191
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:53,299
in the point in point for technology and

1192
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:56,089
politics a review of literature and

1193
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:59,538
community positions we try to document

1194
01:02:56,089 --> 01:03:02,089
as pure as possible the positions that

1195
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:05,119
have been observed in the community as

1196
01:03:02,089 --> 01:03:07,279
they were so so we did not try to lump

1197
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:11,960
them together but try to isolate groups

1198
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:14,900
within that help on position and couple

1199
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:21,250
that with existing literature to to

1200
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:24,589
situate it into into a broader context I

1201
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:26,059
have been thinking about then trying to

1202
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:28,849
brick

1203
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:34,309
further in conversation with each other

1204
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:38,839
but that did not necessarily something

1205
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:41,059
very constructive because it this is

1206
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:43,400
simply what we observed and then what we

1207
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:46,220
then try to add in analysis in point

1208
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,680
five to see how does that break down

1209
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:52,700
into into practice when we look at

1210
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:58,160
standards so I'm not sure how I could

1211
01:03:52,700 --> 01:04:01,160
further analyze the positions under in a

1212
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:06,200
more constructive way and I'm a bit

1213
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:08,149
careful about the discussion but I would

1214
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,788
like to hear very much more about like

1215
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:13,490
the process versus the outcome or the

1216
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:15,859
output because a protocol of course is a

1217
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:17,450
process in itself right and it's never a

1218
01:04:15,859 --> 01:04:21,440
thing that's done because it's how it's

1219
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:24,520
used and and it's a complex assemblage

1220
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,349
in itself so I think it will be hard to

1221
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:34,630
to pin it down in general but I'm very

1222
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:34,630
happy to be the guestlist okay thank you

1223
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:43,990
relating from the jabber aviary Doria

1224
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:45,250
says it might be a good idea to get

1225
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:50,529
people to agree to a thorough

1226
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:51,580
read-through I agree I'm go ahead here

1227
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:54,030
at the queue and then I have a comment

1228
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,029
as well

1229
01:04:54,540 --> 01:05:01,060
hi Joseph man with these algorithms

1230
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:02,830
foundation so I have a question but I'm

1231
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,330
not sure if I'm it's gonna be a

1232
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:07,990
completely naive question because I was

1233
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:12,549
doing two sessions right now but when I

1234
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:15,939
look at the draft I don't see explicit

1235
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:18,220
reference to 20 21 19 and the uses of

1236
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:20,080
like the capitalized must and shell and

1237
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,020
things like that and this would actually

1238
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:25,660
be a pretty interesting RFC to make use

1239
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:29,830
of those terms in that in that formal

1240
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:31,000
way thanks for your question ed meals

1241
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:33,810
while you're getting to the mic to

1242
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,810
answer that okay

1243
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:43,090
that is not language that we can use in

1244
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:45,100
research group documents because we

1245
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:47,290
cannot make any normative statements or

1246
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:50,950
do you mean that we should reflect on

1247
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:52,240
the use of normative statements really

1248
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:55,299
I'm just talking about the difference

1249
01:05:52,240 --> 01:06:01,270
like 2119 provides formal definitions of

1250
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:02,830
words so it doesn't it so long as it's a

1251
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:05,140
longer thought in terms of the context

1252
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:07,330
but it's really the formal meaning of

1253
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:11,020
the word so can and shall and should and

1254
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:13,299
so forth when it really means that it

1255
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:16,950
just provides the formal definition of

1256
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,950
it versus an informal colloquial meaning

1257
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:23,920
I'm not sure whether I get it but of

1258
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:25,510
course full requests or or suggestions

1259
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,430
on the list always very welcome and then

1260
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:33,430
we can consider how and where to include

1261
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:35,290
them so just going back to the

1262
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:38,470
suggestion from RE which is a good one

1263
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:40,660
that everyone has a variant I think I'd

1264
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:43,569
be good if we can bound that in time so

1265
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:45,759
since we also have Association that's

1266
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:48,130
going to be discussed and the next month

1267
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,509
as a commitment if people can please go

1268
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:52,959
back to the list and then I

1269
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:56,829
month up reading it early and just even

1270
01:06:52,959 --> 01:06:59,198
the slightest you know sentence or

1271
01:06:56,829 --> 01:07:01,929
encouragement would be helpful if you

1272
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,179
have done so as a final read and then

1273
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:05,829
for those who are maybe engaging it with

1274
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:07,569
it for the for the first time or even

1275
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:10,029
yeah even people who've been watching

1276
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:11,859
this progress for a while if you can try

1277
01:07:10,029 --> 01:07:14,709
to answer the question does this draft

1278
01:07:11,859 --> 01:07:17,859
achieve what we would like for it to

1279
01:07:14,709 --> 01:07:20,859
achieve which is to help establish the

1280
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:23,799
boundaries of the ongoing and pervasive

1281
01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:26,380
discussion about what or not protocols

1282
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:28,389
are political so does this draft do

1283
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,249
achieved that for you and your use cases

1284
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:33,609
and the discussions that you've had in

1285
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:35,078
this space is it going to be useful for

1286
01:07:33,609 --> 01:07:37,058
you to reference this and if you can

1287
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:39,819
think about that when you're reading it

1288
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:41,949
and then send your thoughts on that to

1289
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:47,349
the lists that would be very helpful in

1290
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:49,749
moving this forward I think they're all

1291
01:07:47,349 --> 01:08:00,149
yes thank you so much Niels thank you

1292
01:07:49,749 --> 01:08:00,149
very much okay Juliana you're up next

1293
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:27,859
the draft on feminism and protocols we

1294
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:34,460
presented it in the last meeting

1295
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:39,259
so next and it was a very preliminary

1296
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:42,230
version where we were trying to cover

1297
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:45,920
two different problems one was on the

1298
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:50,439
user level and it was like taking at the

1299
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:54,800
feminist principles of the internet to

1300
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:57,950
collect some cases and to relate it to

1301
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:00,410
protocols and the other was try to

1302
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:04,939
identify some manifestations of gender

1303
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:07,700
of gender discrimination in the IETF

1304
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:13,549
archive so just to say that that part

1305
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:20,920
was gone so in this second note the

1306
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:25,520
first version version one we are like

1307
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:36,260
like focusing on based on the eighty to

1308
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:38,690
eighty which uses the Human Rights to

1309
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:41,780
understand how protocols can enable or

1310
01:09:38,689 --> 01:09:44,330
restrict some specific human rights that

1311
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:48,050
this relation so they use some specific

1312
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:50,420
concepts and we're trying to use that

1313
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:53,480
format to make it with feminist

1314
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:55,490
principles of the internet we already

1315
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:58,009
presented what the feminist principles

1316
01:09:55,490 --> 01:10:03,200
are but you can find it in feminist

1317
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:05,210
internet.org so the difference is that

1318
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,790
in human rights

1319
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:11,660
this is pretended that everyone has

1320
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:13,730
guaranteed their rights equally but the

1321
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:16,700
feminist principles changes that

1322
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:19,280
question understanding that not

1323
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:25,580
everybody has the same capacity to have

1324
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:26,759
their rights guaranteed so our framework

1325
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:28,929
is

1326
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:35,620
intersectionality which is a concept

1327
01:10:28,929 --> 01:10:39,659
used from the black feminism from the

1328
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:44,949
United States but now used in different

1329
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:48,099
parts of the global south mainly so this

1330
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:49,530
framework understands try to understand

1331
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:54,280
how multiple forms of discrimination

1332
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:57,929
overlap is not focused on the problem of

1333
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:00,610
equality but difference and

1334
01:10:57,929 --> 01:11:03,760
discrimination is not analyzed in terms

1335
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:06,130
of effective access of right but the

1336
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:12,000
conditions and the capacities to access

1337
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:15,340
that rights so we have three very

1338
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,620
important concepts the first is the

1339
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:20,250
social locations which are the multiple

1340
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:23,830
layered identities people lived which

1341
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:27,460
are derived from social relations

1342
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:30,730
histories structures of power where

1343
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:34,389
people can experience both oppression

1344
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:37,540
and privilege an example is me in my

1345
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:41,590
country I am ultra privileged but here I

1346
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:44,260
am like not exactly oppressed but for

1347
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:46,449
example in my country I speak English

1348
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:48,310
very well but here I feel so bad because

1349
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:50,799
I don't speak English and it is very

1350
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:54,429
difficult for me to express what I am

1351
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:57,060
thinking yes I have studied as many

1352
01:11:54,429 --> 01:12:01,449
people in my country can not do I have a

1353
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:05,020
superior grade of studying yes at a

1354
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:07,690
postgraduate but here but I studied

1355
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:09,790
cultural studies so here this is very

1356
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:14,799
difficult to express myself because you

1357
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:17,199
are mostly technicians so that

1358
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,409
configures the way I can express myself

1359
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:24,250
here and I can't really have a relation

1360
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:29,920
with you in terms of power I feel I feel

1361
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:32,530
like very small here so this is one

1362
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:37,989
point the other are the different

1363
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:39,610
operations I one person can feel which

1364
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:44,559
are determined by gender

1365
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:46,929
race sexuality age studies geographical

1366
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:51,520
locations abilities health conditions

1367
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:53,650
and among others and this is all that

1368
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,429
other important concept which is matrix

1369
01:12:53,650 --> 01:13:00,480
of domination is the way in which powers

1370
01:12:57,429 --> 01:13:03,130
that produce and reproduce intersecting

1371
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,980
operations are organized so in the draft

1372
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:09,520
we have this question I think this is

1373
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:12,009
not completed but can we understand the

1374
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:15,310
internet in the sense we work in

1375
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:17,830
Internet here as a matrix of them in a

1376
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:20,320
mass a matrix of domination and try to

1377
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:24,880
understand how operations are organ and

1378
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:27,460
powers are organized there so this is

1379
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:31,750
where we are next

1380
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:35,619
and based on disk on that question we

1381
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:39,670
are trying to make this table principle

1382
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:45,009
by principle and based on the principle

1383
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:49,000
description first this is they said harm

1384
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:51,489
and the question is how the oppression

1385
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,190
is being expressed in this principle in

1386
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:55,119
each principle and how can it be related

1387
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:58,210
to protocol

1388
01:13:55,119 --> 01:14:01,150
so we're based in 80 to 80 and they

1389
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:03,880
talked about some specific terms like

1390
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:07,150
interoperability centralization content

1391
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:11,010
agnosticism censorship resistance and

1392
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:15,869
we're trying first to understand those

1393
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:18,280
concepts related how with how the

1394
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:22,540
oppressions are being expressed in the

1395
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:26,889
principles and so that's where we are

1396
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:32,699
with and the next step is to collect

1397
01:14:26,889 --> 01:14:37,060
kind of use cases based on this first

1398
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:43,000
approach and yes that's where we are

1399
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:46,230
it's a very difficult issue and ok

1400
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,199
that's and this is difficult because

1401
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:53,349
it's different from the human rights

1402
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:57,730
because it is it has like different

1403
01:14:53,350 --> 01:15:00,610
points now one is access but we have

1404
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:02,530
movements too and for example in

1405
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:05,230
movement inside movements we have

1406
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:09,400
governance and this part of governance

1407
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:13,599
has is related to how do we participate

1408
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:17,860
in these spaces that's why I think we

1409
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:21,040
were trying to understand something

1410
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:23,679
which is I think out of scope and this

1411
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:29,860
version of the draft it's more related

1412
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:32,080
with for example RFC 77040 but this is a

1413
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:37,480
working progress we're trying to address

1414
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:41,230
it better and next steps we're

1415
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:44,530
developing a methodology which tries to

1416
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:48,040
be more collaborative and participative

1417
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:52,120
we presented this draft in the last IFF

1418
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:54,580
in valencia and the problem was that we

1419
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:57,160
were with women working on

1420
01:15:54,580 --> 01:16:00,040
infrastructure but almost everybody

1421
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,550
didn't know about ITF and what is it

1422
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:05,230
about

1423
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:08,880
so it was like Mallory and I presenting

1424
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:13,389
and everybody saying like Oh interesting

1425
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:16,240
nothing to say so the next place where

1426
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:18,190
we were we are going to share it is in

1427
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:22,200
the citizen lab Summer Institute and

1428
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:26,259
there we are going to make more practice

1429
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:30,660
workshop more practical workshop trying

1430
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:35,560
to mix the feminist principles with some

1431
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:37,599
protocols texts and to see what can we

1432
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:40,300
do with this based on the concepts

1433
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:46,120
represented or are present in 80 to 80

1434
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:50,640
and so we hope to find some cases into a

1435
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:55,599
script it's better here and yes that's

1436
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:57,370
something to say Thank You Juliana yeah

1437
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,530
I'll just add to that in addition to

1438
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:02,590
sort of in-person presentations and

1439
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:05,769
discussions with feminists you know

1440
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:07,180
movements and organizations we've also

1441
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:09,070
got some mailing lists

1442
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:11,110
where we could where we've kind of been

1443
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:12,940
thinking about you know how to present

1444
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:13,750
this to get some online discussion as

1445
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,820
well

1446
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:17,470
we've had people opportunistically reach

1447
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:20,170
out to us that are meeting face to face

1448
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:21,790
it's tech and social justice events that

1449
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:23,770
have come across this and reached out to

1450
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:25,840
us with their thoughts so yeah I think

1451
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:28,750
it's actually part of it's very it's

1452
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,070
very feminist thing to both be writing

1453
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,760
something down and doing research but

1454
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:35,590
also organizing and building

1455
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,300
participation and buy-in from the

1456
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:39,640
feminist movement like we're trying to

1457
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,460
do both at the same time and so here

1458
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:44,170
what matters is what is presented in

1459
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:47,340
text but there's like a whole lot of

1460
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:50,680
other organizing and discussing and

1461
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:53,830
referencing and you know daydreaming

1462
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:55,990
actually that happens that's not visible

1463
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:57,880
as much here that it's just it's

1464
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:02,010
important for something like this to

1465
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:05,580
have an impact thank you

1466
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:20,290
any other comments people have questions

1467
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:24,990
words of encouragement hello from Europe

1468
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:24,990
side of this channel well we've just

1469
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:32,130
[Music]

1470
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:34,810
we'll see how that goes I would

1471
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:36,070
encourage you don't worry about feeling

1472
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,450
small I feel very small in this

1473
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:39,969
surrounded by technical people and I'm

1474
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:44,139
moderately technical but we all have our

1475
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:46,090
environments where we experience we are

1476
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,590
privileged or power and others where we

1477
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:50,920
don't I'm still searching for one where

1478
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:52,870
I can feel moderately powerful in it but

1479
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,180
anyway so encourage you not not to worry

1480
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:57,210
about that but in the form of use cases

1481
01:18:55,180 --> 01:19:03,010
I'd also encourage you maybe look at

1482
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:11,350
asylum and Refugee cases there it's that

1483
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:14,620
their their place to look yes are you

1484
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:17,160
talking about refugees cases yes yes yes

1485
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:21,210
yes it is the question about

1486
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:22,858
intersectionality is trying to

1487
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:28,119
[Music]

1488
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:30,129
I could see those cases - but we're

1489
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:32,589
based on the feminist principles of the

1490
01:19:30,129 --> 01:19:35,108
internet which has like sexual and

1491
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:39,820
gender lens to understand these problems

1492
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:42,550
but of course we have to our question is

1493
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:45,518
about discrimination and marginalized

1494
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:50,590
groups so this is not the same to be

1495
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:54,010
like man refugees like political for

1496
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:58,030
political persecution or to be I don't

1497
01:19:54,010 --> 01:20:03,070
know a person who's escaping from war

1498
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:05,438
and has no economic resources and gets

1499
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:08,259
to another country and it's not the same

1500
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:11,889
to be women the woman or something

1501
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:15,340
and so yes that's the question in back

1502
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:18,129
well yes I would I'd sorry I would take

1503
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:19,629
it further than just the simple or the

1504
01:20:18,129 --> 01:20:21,070
the first stage of crossing the border

1505
01:20:19,629 --> 01:20:24,369
as a refugee crossing an international

1506
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:26,768
border rather than a domestic border but

1507
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:29,108
the once you'll cross their new you

1508
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:31,749
register is asylum seeker then within

1509
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:34,599
the asylum seeker side of HM may take

1510
01:20:31,749 --> 01:20:37,059
many years until you were granted asylum

1511
01:20:34,599 --> 01:20:39,399
or something but within that that area I

1512
01:20:37,059 --> 01:20:45,609
think there are many use cases you could

1513
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:49,959
pick up where there's a there's a gender

1514
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:52,239
bias towards who is who has spoken to

1515
01:20:49,959 --> 01:21:00,999
who is ink in control and and the power

1516
01:20:52,239 --> 01:21:03,638
within within no I mean I think you're

1517
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:05,499
right to bring it into like there's an

1518
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:06,999
intersectional purview so it doesn't

1519
01:21:05,499 --> 01:21:09,280
even necessarily need to be all about

1520
01:21:06,999 --> 01:21:11,108
gender but it could be within the

1521
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,389
intersectional approach to looking at

1522
01:21:11,109 --> 01:21:14,739
power dynamics my the only thing I'm

1523
01:21:13,389 --> 01:21:17,260
struggling with to understand your case

1524
01:21:14,739 --> 01:21:21,098
is how this might be impacted by the

1525
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:23,079
internet or specifically protocols but

1526
01:21:21,099 --> 01:21:24,489
yeah if you wanted to get back in the

1527
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:25,599
queue we can continue the discussion I

1528
01:21:24,489 --> 01:21:27,699
think it would be interesting to

1529
01:21:25,599 --> 01:21:31,929
understand your point Niels you're up

1530
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:34,638
and then Jonathan yeah first of all

1531
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:37,280
thanks so much for the authors for

1532
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,409
for bringing this work forward and I

1533
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:44,659
think it's very good because it's really

1534
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:46,190
opening up a new discussion in in the

1535
01:21:44,659 --> 01:21:48,619
field where one would not expect so

1536
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:50,419
that's always very exciting and I think

1537
01:21:48,619 --> 01:21:53,019
it really helps us push the boundaries

1538
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:56,750
and think further and also think further

1539
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:59,150
further about power and that's also what

1540
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:05,690
my question is about so how are you

1541
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:09,259
going to operationalize how power is is

1542
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:11,269
understood and then especially what I'm

1543
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:14,119
interested in and that's maybe also a

1544
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:16,010
part that we removed from a draft

1545
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:19,809
political so it might be interesting to

1546
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:24,409
edit here or to consider it and that's

1547
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:29,750
economy because oftentimes in capitalist

1548
01:22:24,409 --> 01:22:32,900
society power is is produced through

1549
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:37,070
capital social or economic or otherwise

1550
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:39,650
so there's at the same time going on the

1551
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:41,150
development of the draft on internet

1552
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:43,849
consolidation and the internet

1553
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:47,000
architecture which is an IAB documents

1554
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:50,659
and I was I was I was I'm very curious

1555
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:54,860
how to intersectionally take that into

1556
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:59,269
account and what could be counter

1557
01:22:54,860 --> 01:23:01,880
examples if one would take feminist

1558
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:04,909
principles into account how that could

1559
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:07,219
lead to other architectures and other

1560
01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:08,929
principles but maybe I'm adding too much

1561
01:23:07,219 --> 01:23:19,100
but I'm really curious what I would look

1562
01:23:08,929 --> 01:23:21,980
like thank you yes me too yes I think

1563
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:23,750
there is a problem when we are talking

1564
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:26,239
about intersectionality and to

1565
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:30,830
understand more in terms of equity than

1566
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:33,610
equality because when easy answer can be

1567
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:38,480
like okay let's design some different

1568
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:42,469
protocols to better attend the

1569
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:45,339
vulnerable groups yes and this is a

1570
01:23:42,469 --> 01:23:48,460
capitalist solution which is mainly or

1571
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:52,670
used a lot

1572
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:57,140
but I think we have to be like very

1573
01:23:52,670 --> 01:24:02,120
careful about how to talk about it and I

1574
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:05,200
I've learned and here I participating in

1575
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:08,630
the list is that we have to try to

1576
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:12,050
address some very little and specific

1577
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:15,530
problems and I think with the feminist

1578
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:20,650
principles this is difficult but we have

1579
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:23,210
to let many problems out of the scope so

1580
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:27,110
I don't know how to solve that but

1581
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:29,210
that's that is what we try now but for

1582
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:33,799
example they drop the participation

1583
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:47,000
nails I think it's good to do that in

1584
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:49,280
other space is it yeah thanks so much

1585
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,470
for that Juliana but you really made me

1586
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,170
excited about and about a new paragraph

1587
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:56,930
about equity equality labor and

1588
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:58,610
knowledge but but but it might be placed

1589
01:24:56,930 --> 01:25:02,180
for another draft but I think it will be

1590
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:05,420
really exciting to touch upon those

1591
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:09,080
whether in this draft or another one so

1592
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:12,410
I'll definitely put it on my on my think

1593
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:14,140
about it list a bit more but yeah

1594
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:17,180
fascinating thanks so much for the work

1595
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:18,650
yeah I did I didn't go those things fit

1596
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,760
into this if you read the feminist

1597
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:21,679
principles of the Internet there's a

1598
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,720
whole section on economy and there's

1599
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:25,310
several sub points and this is one of

1600
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:28,100
the things that excites me about doing

1601
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:31,220
this draft is that you know human rights

1602
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:34,250
are not they don't confront power and

1603
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:36,620
economy the same way so that's what this

1604
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:43,250
framework will allow us to do which is

1605
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:45,920
quite exciting Johnson one one thing I'm

1606
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:51,860
curious as to whether it really fits in

1607
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:53,180
here is privacy in as much as it is very

1608
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:55,130
difficult to discriminate against

1609
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:58,250
somebody if you do not know their

1610
01:25:55,130 --> 01:26:00,920
categorization so if you don't know that

1611
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:01,420
somebody is an ethnic minority a woman

1612
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:05,530
now G

1613
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:08,590
bTW then you can't discriminate because

1614
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:11,349
on a sort of very literally sense you

1615
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:16,179
can't discriminate you can't distinguish

1616
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:19,679
between and so is there a space here for

1617
01:26:16,179 --> 01:26:23,550
saying actually privacy is probably the

1618
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:32,610
the most literal way to reduce

1619
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:32,610
discrimination on the Internet yes I

1620
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:42,060
think the feminist principles are more

1621
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:45,629
focused on the question about feminine

1622
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:51,310
or feminist women and queer people

1623
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:55,380
autonomy more than how can be protected

1624
01:26:51,310 --> 01:27:00,010
so this is a very different question

1625
01:26:55,380 --> 01:27:03,730
because as you know we have a very big

1626
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:08,140
gender gap digital gender gap from their

1627
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:11,910
use to the production and so the problem

1628
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:14,920
is not ok you discriminate and to

1629
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:18,449
recognize or better recognize the

1630
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:21,310
differences and it can be named like

1631
01:27:18,449 --> 01:27:25,839
positive discrimination but the issue

1632
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:29,890
here is other and this is more like how

1633
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:32,410
can we make our own choices about what

1634
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:34,150
we want to do how can we of course is

1635
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:37,239
the same question I think it was in

1636
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:39,610
political like can the internet make

1637
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:42,099
this necessarily better or the society

1638
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:43,960
just will be better or the internet it

1639
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:47,199
will be better only if the society gets

1640
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:50,650
better and this is I think it's not

1641
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:52,690
necessary to discuss it here but the

1642
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:55,570
problem here is more than more about

1643
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:57,879
autonomy than specifically privacy and

1644
01:27:55,570 --> 01:28:00,130
privacy is one of the chapters of the

1645
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:03,340
feminist principles so I don't have an

1646
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:08,500
answer but of course we think we're

1647
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:09,790
trying to look at the other side just to

1648
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,350
add to that I mean just another way of

1649
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:13,090
saying exactly what you've said Julianne

1650
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:15,390
is that traditionally in

1651
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:18,370
like like in the theory of

1652
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:20,820
intersectional feminism it's it's fine

1653
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:23,830
to be able to pass if you're you know a

1654
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:25,450
LGBTQ person or hide or to avoid

1655
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:26,950
discrimination but part of the point is

1656
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:29,260
to not do that because that's part of

1657
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:30,730
the layers of oppression so I don't know

1658
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:32,410
that it's exactly the same because I

1659
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:34,780
think on the internet we are looking at

1660
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:36,490
protecting everyone's privacy but when

1661
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:38,590
you're expressing feminism as like a

1662
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:41,170
desire for the world that you want

1663
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:42,700
hiding and not being yourself is not one

1664
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:45,430
of those things so you turn it into a

1665
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:48,040
positive expression of you know autonomy

1666
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:50,800
which is maybe another way of looking at

1667
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:52,480
at privacy but is a positive expression

1668
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,310
of that rather than like if I just

1669
01:28:52,480 --> 01:29:01,509
weren't who I am then I wouldn't face

1670
01:28:54,310 --> 01:29:04,260
these issues right thank you hello my

1671
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:07,720
name is Sophie so thank you so much for

1672
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:10,750
this the contribution your work I think

1673
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:14,350
this is tremendous and it's been we've

1674
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:16,120
been looking for that for many years so

1675
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:18,520
thank you so much for bringing this to

1676
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:20,910
the table yeah I think it's a crucial

1677
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:25,450
work so um I guess I have two questions

1678
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:28,360
my first question would be how has this

1679
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:30,220
draft been received in within this

1680
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:33,610
community so that would be the first

1681
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:36,070
question the second question would be so

1682
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:39,250
I'm wondering if you are investigating

1683
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:41,830
the question of you know feminist

1684
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:46,960
standards and protocol not just the

1685
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:50,290
impact of you know standards and

1686
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,760
protocol let's proof from this

1687
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:53,410
perspective

1688
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:57,060
because I think there's a there's also a

1689
01:29:53,410 --> 01:30:00,130
difference there and I guess there are

1690
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:02,710
already quite a number feminists

1691
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:04,690
technologies or promise tech

1692
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:07,270
infrastructures there are being built

1693
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:08,830
and that are in operations whether there

1694
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:10,360
are feminist servers or more complex

1695
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:12,970
feminists tech infrastructures that

1696
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:15,580
exists and so we can probably learn from

1697
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:18,600
them as well I'm sure you're in touch

1698
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:22,320
with them because you've been at the IFF

1699
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:25,630
but I think they might have a sense of

1700
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:26,960
what could be feminist protocols and

1701
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:29,410
standards

1702
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:34,700
there's also a zine that is upcoming in

1703
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:37,010
September on how to install from this

1704
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,900
service or our feminist servers and what

1705
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:40,790
are the protocols and standards so I'm

1706
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:42,019
happy to share that theme which is in

1707
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:49,519
process with you

1708
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:54,860
thanks yes thank you yes of course I

1709
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:58,040
think that our dreama is feminist

1710
01:30:54,860 --> 01:31:02,929
protocols and standards but this may be

1711
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:07,190
but here we are asking for the impacts

1712
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:09,350
from a feminist perspective yeah so

1713
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:11,540
that's question and of course we're

1714
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:14,980
trying to work together with women

1715
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:20,019
working on technology using standards

1716
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:25,509
dealing with standards and protocols so

1717
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:29,300
my experience in iff was that we need to

1718
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:33,980
find a way as similar to a question in

1719
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:37,640
the draft on Association I think that's

1720
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:39,950
a big question to us because we have to

1721
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:43,490
find a way to bring this information

1722
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:45,950
about protocols to them because they say

1723
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:48,349
this this is so boring this is not my

1724
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:52,099
space this is not my interest I just

1725
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:54,970
want to have my own server to serve our

1726
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:58,670
movement yes for example in feminists is

1727
01:31:54,970 --> 01:32:02,540
infrastructure so we think this is

1728
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:07,280
important to bring a their knowledge and

1729
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:08,930
to embed it in or dropped so yes we're

1730
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:12,950
trying to work with them but we're

1731
01:32:08,930 --> 01:32:17,750
finding the codes too were like breach

1732
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:22,010
so we're here we're trying to write in

1733
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:25,160
this format the ID format but we need to

1734
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:29,060
bring it there so this is what we're

1735
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:33,559
doing now and happy to hear about what

1736
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:35,720
happens in September yeah hello and on

1737
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,960
Marcus from foundation thanks for your

1738
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:40,610
work first of all and then two things I

1739
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,070
think the first

1740
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:45,290
which could help a lot of people here

1741
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:48,259
who probably don't see how this could

1742
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:52,640
fit into the ITF or ITF is to collect

1743
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:55,100
cases concrete cases how women or other

1744
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:57,530
marginalized groups are oppressed I can

1745
01:32:55,100 --> 01:33:00,740
imagine originally with privacy as I

1746
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:02,630
mentioned or or or with censorship

1747
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:05,719
in social media or something like that I

1748
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:07,430
think since it possible and the second

1749
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:10,760
thing is I think you should connect to

1750
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:13,310
Sarah Jamie Lewis from open privacy

1751
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,950
she wrote even a book on queer privacy

1752
01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:20,450
and she's based in Vancouver Canada so

1753
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:22,480
perhaps for one of the next ITA ITF

1754
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:25,970
sessions which will be there I think

1755
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:28,759
she's an expert in cryptography and and

1756
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:32,210
and as also this correct his right mind

1757
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:34,990
set let's say to I think to think about

1758
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:37,670
in these areas here so this could be

1759
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:39,440
very beneficial and she helped us in

1760
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:42,740
Switzerland to get rid of Internet

1761
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,509
voting that's an author story but I

1762
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:46,309
could also help with connecting

1763
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:50,720
otherwise I think that could be

1764
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:53,470
beneficial to this thank you I think

1765
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:56,570
Vancouver could be a really cool moment

1766
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:58,720
and I would love so this kind of bridges

1767
01:33:56,570 --> 01:34:01,639
both yes also so for your comment is

1768
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,890
just makes me realize that we've so far

1769
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:05,660
been consulting like pretty widely and

1770
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:07,550
like holding workshops and people come

1771
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:11,330
but I think we could probably do a lot

1772
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:13,430
more to reach out to the sister servers

1773
01:34:11,330 --> 01:34:14,960
what film servers lists like other

1774
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:17,300
things and ask people if they could give

1775
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,490
us their time and we can you know just

1776
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,960
have a conversation about maybe even

1777
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:22,910
develop questions but I would just love

1778
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,280
to have a conversation about this with

1779
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:26,809
them both ways right like here's what

1780
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,160
we're trying to do what are your

1781
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:29,990
reactions to some of that and trying to

1782
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:38,920
collect a bit of it that would be really

1783
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:43,990
fun too we can do it Amit Cooper I have

1784
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:48,770
I'm Stephan katsu two comments yeah

1785
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:50,540
first yeah like I would like to come

1786
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:52,610
back like this idea of different

1787
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:54,880
audience because I wrote like this

1788
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:57,339
question in my present

1789
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,620
this morning besan actually your

1790
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:01,690
experience because last week I met

1791
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:06,280
somebody who said are we talking about

1792
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:10,809
this draft feminist RFC and I was a bit

1793
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:13,000
surprised about this and I feel like we

1794
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:15,430
have the impression well I had the

1795
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,880
impression that the work we do here was

1796
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:21,640
more to interact within ITF but actually

1797
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:24,910
it's a good tool also to send symbolize

1798
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:26,980
other people about the work of ITF so I

1799
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:30,309
think it's really great that you're like

1800
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:33,360
bringing this RFC to groups that they

1801
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:36,280
don't know anything about RFC and

1802
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:39,670
discuss this so they can think about

1803
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:42,190
like what's the impact of this the other

1804
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:45,670
thing it's just an idea where I have

1805
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:49,360
different ideas but just to go to move

1806
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:52,750
from a feminist perspective on protocol

1807
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:56,740
to feminist protocols

1808
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:59,830
there's the RFC that the andrew is

1809
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:01,660
chairing i've shared on the alternative

1810
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:05,019
network deployments where they analyze

1811
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:07,930
different like different kind of

1812
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:10,060
community networks and alternative

1813
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:13,240
network it could be a good model

1814
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:17,220
actually to use to map like the

1815
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:20,110
different kind of feminist feminists

1816
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:22,600
incitive or feminists and for structures

1817
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:25,120
in relation yeah feminist initiative in

1818
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:30,670
relation to technologies so it might be

1819
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:32,830
a good step to to go to standards yeah

1820
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:36,100
well I think it's really good to bring

1821
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:37,870
this it's like yeah yeah I mean some of

1822
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:40,360
the like what you're alluding to Sophie

1823
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:43,510
as well as it there are implementers out

1824
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:45,040
there implementers of IETF protocols

1825
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:46,870
because they're running infrastructure

1826
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,970
they're just very small right and

1827
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:50,019
they're very like they have their own

1828
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:52,570
worlds and they're important in that

1829
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:54,700
world but by comparison to the folks

1830
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:57,280
that come here they're very small but I

1831
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,530
think it is a that so the process of

1832
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,840
engaging a dialogue with them could help

1833
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:04,210
us cite their work if they've done

1834
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,650
writing it could help you know bring

1835
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:07,420
them into this space so they can

1836
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:08,469
contribute like just bringing that

1837
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:10,060
closer right

1838
01:37:08,469 --> 01:37:12,370
trying to raise up the visibility that

1839
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:14,050
that is actually that it that exists

1840
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:18,340
feminist infrastructure feminist

1841
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:23,080
internet infrastructure is a thing thank

1842
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:25,180
you thank you so much Juliana I would

1843
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:26,590
just too in that section and move on to

1844
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:29,380
the next one which is you gray Shabbat

1845
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:30,880
just to say that one of the things that

1846
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:32,469
we are looking forward this is a bit

1847
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,920
more engagement so so far the reaction

1848
01:37:32,469 --> 01:37:37,960
it's not has been vine in the sense that

1849
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,210
but there's just not been much of one so

1850
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:42,250
if people could really engage and help

1851
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:44,230
guide it because it's very an institute

1852
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:46,060
draft like it's not anywhere and your

1853
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:47,379
complete but that's a good thing we're

1854
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,340
taking our time we're trying to do it

1855
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:50,380
right and we'd really appreciate

1856
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:55,710
feedback at any stage so feel free to

1857
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:55,710
engage with them okay that's the end

1858
01:37:55,890 --> 01:38:01,540
so go shabbat you're going to talk about

1859
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:04,930
the guidelines draft and then i don't

1860
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:06,969
know if there's anyone on it remotely

1861
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:08,739
that's going to be presenting on reviews

1862
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:13,140
they've done but it might just be you as

1863
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:13,139
well for that portion yeah okay

1864
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:21,940
hello again go sir would go yes and so

1865
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:23,500
needs and I are Co editing the

1866
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:26,049
guidelines for Human Rights protocol and

1867
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:28,900
architecture consideration means is

1868
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:34,330
they're so nice please feel free to jump

1869
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:37,089
in yes

1870
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:39,269
so this document updates RFC eighty to

1871
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:42,580
eighty which has an entire section on

1872
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:43,900
human rights considerations like

1873
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:48,070
guidelines for human rights

1874
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:50,110
considerations and what we're doing with

1875
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:53,049
the current draft is updating those

1876
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:56,769
guidelines after experience from two

1877
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:59,140
views and it is practice based in that

1878
01:38:56,770 --> 01:39:02,380
sense and we want it to be more useful

1879
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:08,980
for people reviewing drafts from this

1880
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:14,079
perspective so yes so the draft was

1881
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:15,789
updated in May after the last meeting

1882
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:19,389
Dress your holes reviews thank you very

1883
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:23,349
much lots of changes in language very

1884
01:39:19,389 --> 01:39:24,849
useful I think mostly to do with how we

1885
01:39:23,349 --> 01:39:28,780
are talking about the Internet itself

1886
01:39:24,849 --> 01:39:30,789
firstly we changed that to one of a

1887
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:32,469
design language like these are the goals

1888
01:39:30,789 --> 01:39:37,599
we want to achieve rather than the

1889
01:39:32,469 --> 01:39:39,609
internet behaves in this way yes and one

1890
01:39:37,599 --> 01:39:41,739
clarification to a guideline which was

1891
01:39:39,609 --> 01:39:44,469
that when when we talking about

1892
01:39:41,739 --> 01:39:48,398
authentication we shouldn't use it in a

1893
01:39:44,469 --> 01:39:51,749
context to like prevent heterogeneity

1894
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:54,969
support things like vendor lock-in or

1895
01:39:51,749 --> 01:40:01,148
digital rights management as its

1896
01:39:54,969 --> 01:40:04,719
euphemistically called and just average

1897
01:40:01,149 --> 01:40:06,099
review thank you very much and we sort

1898
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,169
of clarified the status of the document

1899
01:40:06,099 --> 01:40:10,689
as well that the guidelines are also

1900
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:15,550
being tested for validity and relevance

1901
01:40:10,689 --> 01:40:18,249
and lots of editorial changes and one

1902
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:20,619
mistake I screwed up the metadata so the

1903
01:40:18,249 --> 01:40:23,469
second editor shows up as University of

1904
01:40:20,619 --> 01:40:25,688
Amsterdam and North Niels I'll fix that

1905
01:40:23,469 --> 01:40:28,389
in the next version and yeah we are

1906
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:29,800
added the update tag so I mean based on

1907
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:32,800
the discussion in the last meeting that

1908
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:42,189
now this constitutes an update to RFC

1909
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:44,800
80 to 80 yes so in O 2 we had also

1910
01:40:42,189 --> 01:40:47,320
changed the title to reflect that since

1911
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:49,869
the experience gained from reviews was

1912
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:54,789
that we're not just using them for

1913
01:40:49,869 --> 01:40:58,089
network protocols but for so for example

1914
01:40:54,789 --> 01:40:59,648
it was used in the review of the

1915
01:40:58,089 --> 01:41:02,919
architecture for software updates for

1916
01:40:59,649 --> 01:41:05,879
IOT devices which is not a traditional

1917
01:41:02,919 --> 01:41:09,839
network protocol in that sense but a

1918
01:41:05,879 --> 01:41:12,608
document in the IETF nonetheless and

1919
01:41:09,839 --> 01:41:15,579
similarly it was used in the

1920
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:18,010
registration extensions group and then

1921
01:41:15,579 --> 01:41:20,889
the IP wave group so we want two

1922
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:25,030
guidelines to be as broad as the

1923
01:41:20,889 --> 01:41:27,500
practice is but we still need to go

1924
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:29,599
through the draft and sort of

1925
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,580
broaden the scope of the guidelines that

1926
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:34,220
are still restricted to network

1927
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:36,740
protocols if you have any suggestions so

1928
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:40,220
that like please feel free to suggest it

1929
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:41,510
here or on the list and we notice that

1930
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:44,950
there are still some guidelines which

1931
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:47,750
don't have an explanation with it as in

1932
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:49,849
like it poses a question but offers no

1933
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:53,450
help for why that question is relevant

1934
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:56,960
so we're still filling those gaps are

1935
01:41:53,450 --> 01:42:00,050
and yes happy to do anything the

1936
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,460
research group would like please feel

1937
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:12,910
free to step on the mic if you have any

1938
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:15,470
suggestions yes and how you can help so

1939
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:18,380
when you are participating in IETF

1940
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:21,460
groups and you're reviewing a document

1941
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:24,710
perhaps a useful thing to do would be e

1942
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:26,510
so you recognize that there like this

1943
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:28,790
particular technical choice might have

1944
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:32,230
an impact on Human Rights then you just

1945
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:35,360
email HR PC with that specific thing and

1946
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:38,599
I mean I mean that's a way to avoid even

1947
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,889
reading this draft by the way the second

1948
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:43,970
thing is that if you're reviewing a

1949
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:45,440
draft and you want to identify problems

1950
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:47,690
that may not have occurred to you

1951
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:49,009
naturally then you might want to look at

1952
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:51,290
the questions in this draft and you may

1953
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:55,080
recognize some important aspects that

1954
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:57,550
you have might have missed yourself and

1955
01:42:55,080 --> 01:43:01,070
[Music]

1956
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:04,780
malorie wrote an email to HR RT with the

1957
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:08,000
list which is closing down yes

1958
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:11,660
essentially if you gain such experience

1959
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:15,290
in working groups please email the HRP c

1960
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:17,389
RG so that we know how these guidelines

1961
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:19,250
are being used and whether you find them

1962
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:27,340
useful we're still evaluating the

1963
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:30,950
utility of this work means hi oh I was

1964
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:32,420
reading a book and I have a question to

1965
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:35,630
you all what do you think it's useful

1966
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:37,640
it's the book called value sensitive

1967
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:40,740
design shaping technology with morale

1968
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:44,280
and agitation by budget Friedman and

1969
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:46,410
Henry and there I found different ways

1970
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:49,170
in which people have thought and looked

1971
01:43:46,410 --> 01:43:51,559
at and assessed the impact of technology

1972
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:54,180
on values and their intertwine Minh and

1973
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,520
I thought this could be interesting for

1974
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:58,470
draft guidelines but the whole idea of

1975
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:00,090
draft guidelines by keeping them

1976
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:03,960
guidelines and not making them such a

1977
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:05,730
monster as RFC 80 to 80 is so my

1978
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,100
question is should that go in here

1979
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:10,440
should it go somewhere else or should I

1980
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:12,900
just keep on reading books and not put

1981
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:14,549
it in a document well could you tell us

1982
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:16,530
a bit more about the different ways

1983
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:19,170
they've liked doing to give us the

1984
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:21,570
really high level stuff if you have a

1985
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:24,030
very very different you know no say they

1986
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:26,490
looked at medical devices and access to

1987
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:32,179
information at engineering project it's

1988
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:32,179
very said in a lot of different ways to

1989
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:38,610
engineers Arctic architects and policy

1990
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:41,300
makers analyzed technology and how it

1991
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:43,860
worked an hour did not work well and

1992
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:46,040
it's a bit higher scope than what we've

1993
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:50,219
been working on and they've also been

1994
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:53,010
they got good literature they got good

1995
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:55,920
historical context so it might be

1996
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:58,590
interesting to situate our work a bit

1997
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:00,480
deeper maybe that's not the best way to

1998
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:02,460
do it in guidelines I don't know

1999
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,570
so it was just the thoughts and I just

2000
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:10,410
wanted to throw it up and hear what

2001
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:16,380
people thought before I started writing

2002
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:17,880
another big document mmm-hmm just

2003
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:20,460
getting to the make sure what do you

2004
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:23,460
think yeah I think it would be like

2005
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:26,760
usually to at least like have those

2006
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:29,640
initial thoughts yeah a few of us in the

2007
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:30,990
room are familiar with that work I don't

2008
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:34,110
see why that would hurt at all it's

2009
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:36,809
really good stuff that's it sorry being

2010
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:38,299
so like blah blah vague but I just

2011
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:43,560
wanted to make sure you had someone else

2012
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:45,960
responding to you if it's not too much

2013
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:47,220
trouble plugging it in or early

2014
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:49,200
sketching out how you might plug it in

2015
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:52,550
might help us see it better but I don't

2016
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,550
think it'll be a problem it sounds great

2017
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:55,500
cool I tried to make it to Paris uh

2018
01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:58,220
Marie and chuck it in and see where we

2019
01:45:55,500 --> 01:46:02,730
are next next meeting

2020
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:04,110
thank you need anybody feel free to come

2021
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:05,750
to the mic I just wanted to make a

2022
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:08,099
couple of clarifying statements about

2023
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:10,500
human rights for you team lists so that

2024
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,540
will be closed down we I'm announcing it

2025
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,980
officially now but also some email to

2026
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:18,050
the list and then Colin it's going to

2027
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:21,480
close it and then yes I had written to

2028
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:25,650
HR PC about that and suggested that

2029
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:27,959
people inform HR PC if they do a review

2030
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:30,540
against the guidelines document or 80 to

2031
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:32,820
80 I just like to be clear about that

2032
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:34,980
too like just based on feedback that

2033
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:37,219
I've received more recently it would not

2034
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:37,219
miss it

2035
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:42,870
bring the HR PC list into the process of

2036
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,610
the review discussion so like if you're

2037
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:47,550
sending a review to a working group list

2038
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:49,860
don't see CH RPC but once that

2039
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:51,810
discussion has run its course and you've

2040
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:55,200
learned something through the process of

2041
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:57,180
you know throwing out your ideas how

2042
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,980
they've been incorporated or not into

2043
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:01,980
than the next version of the draft

2044
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:04,139
document etc etc do a post-mortem do a

2045
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:06,809
debrief about that with HR PC because

2046
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:08,550
that will be what's helpful to learn

2047
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:11,130
from that process not to be involved in

2048
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:12,630
the process does that make sense okay

2049
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:14,460
cool and I will reiterate that on the

2050
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:26,250
list as well so everybody has clarity

2051
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:28,410
around that yes yeah and one more thing

2052
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:30,150
about the draft there was a recent

2053
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:36,389
discussion about the right to legal

2054
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:39,210
remedy on the list if I am of the

2055
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:41,700
personal opinion that so in fact this

2056
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:44,760
was brought up in review one time which

2057
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:48,780
was the registration a extensions

2058
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:50,490
protocol working group and but that was

2059
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:52,349
in a context where the right to legal

2060
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:54,860
remedy was enforced

2061
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:57,930
I mean in a context where it was used

2062
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:59,610
against the state so you should have the

2063
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:02,340
right to legal remedy against the state

2064
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:04,250
and I still think it's an exceptional

2065
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:06,449
case because most protocols don't

2066
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:10,290
directly deal with

2067
01:48:06,449 --> 01:48:12,690
government of state bodies but if you

2068
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:17,370
have strong or weak opinions about this

2069
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:19,500
please feel free to step about in what

2070
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:22,940
form if more text needs to be included

2071
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,940
about the right to leave remedy

2072
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:48,389
enjoy you step into the mic on oh that

2073
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:48,390
was a lot of suspense okay thank you

2074
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:54,250
okay thank you thank you so much did you

2075
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:58,110
get abused yes you want to go into that

2076
01:48:54,250 --> 01:49:01,690
yes so after the last meeting there has

2077
01:48:58,110 --> 01:49:05,769
like no review experience been brought

2078
01:49:01,690 --> 01:49:10,540
to the list so not much of a huge update

2079
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:12,460
on that but I I know from talking to

2080
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:16,990
people that to our incoming don't want

2081
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:19,750
to spoil those though so does anyone is

2082
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:21,190
anyone using the guidelines has anyone

2083
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:23,050
written the human rights considerations

2084
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:25,509
section lately who wants to discuss

2085
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:30,190
their experience there okay there is a

2086
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:31,840
link which so some authors of RFC's and

2087
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:33,849
drafts have started including a human

2088
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:35,740
rights considerations action sometimes

2089
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:40,480
it's not actually rooted in human rights

2090
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:42,670
but nonetheless if you are writing one

2091
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:47,019
please let us know if the guidelines are

2092
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:54,040
useful yes a great might be very useful

2093
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:55,330
to know yeah doesn't sound like

2094
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:57,370
anybody's gonna talk about there of you

2095
01:49:55,330 --> 01:50:00,460
so that's okay and you're gonna message

2096
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:03,130
us soon about that yours yeah okay in

2097
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:05,080
the post-mortem end are you planning on

2098
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:07,420
I mean you said you alluded earlier to

2099
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:10,030
like you're gonna make a change to the

2100
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:11,560
editorial mistake in the next version do

2101
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:12,969
you have an ETA for that or you're gonna

2102
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,650
wait until you get substantive comments

2103
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:19,090
to do another version what's your plan

2104
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:21,549
yes so in the next 45 days there should

2105
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:23,800
be an update with more explanation to

2106
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:26,020
certain guidelines and fixing more

2107
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:27,400
editorial stuff okay and you and Neil's

2108
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:29,020
I mean Neil's this question is also to

2109
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,790
you you're gonna be working on the sort

2110
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:32,770
of next steps that you outline or you

2111
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:35,740
need to do you need to call in some

2112
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:37,180
favors to help on certain sections or

2113
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:42,490
you got it

2114
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:43,990
so one thing is because I repeated this

2115
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:45,280
call for the second time which is that

2116
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:47,679
if you are writing a human rights

2117
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,330
consideration section but from the ones

2118
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,830
I've noticed I think we'll just get in

2119
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:53,380
touch with them personally I think

2120
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:55,149
that's the better route okay yeah so

2121
