10
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,300
so here's a bunch of stuff we have our

11
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:56,480
charter mailing list we need a minutes

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,928
taker and a jabber scribe now I'm also

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,519
on the in the jabber room but still need

14
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:06,110
somebody described and but first

15
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:10,280
somebody to take minutes Thank You Ted

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,990
and JavaScript just need to be in the

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,030
Java room and relay if anything if

18
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,570
anybody wants to send there's not a lot

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,010
of people in the Java room so don't

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,429
suppose this is going to be very

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:28,340
difficult to desk come on we need we

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:36,380
need a Java Script we can't proceed

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:38,200
unless we have a jabber scribe okay

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,759
thank you

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,280
Roman is taking the dual roles of a tee

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:48,470
in JavaScript blue sheets are going

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,100
around and please fill them up okay so

28
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:56,210
there's our agenda it's also in the

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:59,210
title of the Java room and minutes taker

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:04,449
please take it do it on the iPad unless

31
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,449
it's really uncomfortable for you okay

32
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:14,150
okay so from the from Prague to now a

33
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,799
few things that happen if you haven't

34
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,810
been following closely on the mailing

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,209
list

36
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:25,780
we had a IPR scare where the University

37
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:28,720
of Farrell authors published an IPR

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,569
statement that he had patents on the

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,959
yank models in the documents and we're

40
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:38,429
willing to provide them provide licenses

41
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,280
on a ran basis but perhaps for a fee

42
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:47,319
that kind of thing kind of scares people

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:50,410
in the security area and so we're having

44
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:54,700
a bit of a scare but then we got them to

45
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:58,480
change the IPR terms to free as long as

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,290
you're implementing be RFC potential

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,290
resulting RFC and unless you're in

48
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,780
litigation against the university now

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,420
which should be good enough at least a

50
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,030
lot of other documents especially pretty

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,940
much anything from Cisco comes with this

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,900
kind of statement so were probably fine

53
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:25,600
and those people who were alarmed on the

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:31,630
mailing list were sated okay so anybody

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:33,340
wants to weigh in on this now okay by

56
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,769
the way the room mic is right there by

57
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,620
the door it's kind of a strange place to

58
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,390
put the only room mic but somebody wants

59
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,530
to say everything you're doing here is

60
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:47,260
stupid and then stomp out that's that's

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:56,799
what the mic is for well you can do some

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:04:01,690
other things so milestones okay IETF

63
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,880
well for this applicability drop is

64
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:07,900
finally finished all the review and

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:10,299
these mean to move into iesg and we have

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,690
requested young doctor review for all

67
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:17,079
our yeah modules those are the important

68
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,140
deliverables by our working group we get

69
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,570
lots of comments and the authors are

70
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,969
working to address them there's a

71
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,540
capability when we have completed

72
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,570
working group last call yes

73
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,160
I just wanted to go back to room

74
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,480
Indonesia as the responsibility I just

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,520
wanted to go back to the status of the

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,900
applicability document we're actually a

77
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,390
little further along than waiting for

78
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,580
sector a nob starve you it's on the is

79
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,789
you tell chat the next time so I believe

80
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,830
it's August 8th yeah thank you thank you

81
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,850
so much thank you so much for moving

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,859
this forward it has been a long process

83
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,650
the capability one is also moving

84
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,980
forward we have requested a yes G to

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:05,070
move forward good thank you

86
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:07,570
some creative issues that young modules

87
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,880
we have lots of comments from the young

88
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,420
doctors we want to resolve all those

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:18,460
issues before we move forward for the

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:21,400
working group last call and there's I

91
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,310
think that's the main progress for those

92
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,380
and for the ipsec flow protection maybe

93
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,400
you wanna say a few words we actually

94
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,990
had a joint meeting with IDR working

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,890
group in the routing because there's

96
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:41,590
several proposals of IPSec control

97
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:43,450
simply because more and more sd1 and

98
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,429
that were coming to place and eating the

99
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:50,800
controller based IPSec control so we had

100
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,970
a joint meeting that was yesterday right

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:06:00,820
and FEMA said okay and so maybe you can

102
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:05,110
give a few more well um so the flow

103
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:08,040
seems to be a well wrapping up we've

104
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,800
been through working with plastic all

105
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,580
the young model stirred up the whole

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,400
issue of how do we encode Ayana

107
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,950
registries in in documents and we

108
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,760
finally decided to gesture used the

109
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,479
number from the registry and so that if

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,719
IP secondly he comes up with a new

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:34,900
algorithm or absurd a 5-second me I mean

112
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,520
any anybody from Russia might come up

113
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:42,380
with the document saying how to use when

114
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,109
one of their ghost protocols in IP sir

115
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,360
and then it t really gets publishing

116
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,290
they get in Vienna number that without

117
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,000
any I to second me involvement and we

118
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,250
don't want to have to leave to revision

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,040
our document every time something like

120
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:02,800
that happens the way if we just do the

121
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:05,240
numbers from the registry then yeah and

122
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,000
an implementation can start using the

123
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,580
Gauss protocol without any problems

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,660
without only need for us to read the

125
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,219
draft so yeah the drafters seems to be

126
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,090
on its way out

127
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:24,380
probably submit to the is G maybe today

128
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:28,700
maybe next week and everything it looks

129
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:31,580
like we're pretty much done with most of

130
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,250
our documents well there's the gap

131
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:54,650
analysis terminology that but they turn

132
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:57,290
on the way common to it so this Sdn

133
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,960
IPSec flow protection draft only copper

134
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,780
the initial configuration for the IPSec

135
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,750
the policies and there's a two to two

136
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,380
cases right and there's another scenario

137
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,510
which is for the rekey mechanism that is

138
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,490
also that is covered by a different

139
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,430
draft which was discussed in The

140
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:20,120
Dispatch right the the control Ikey

141
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:24,020
controller a key that's a different

142
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,510
aspect right okay conversation we use

143
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:30,909
two Mike's the controller Ike is kind of

144
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:36,319
a different a different document that's

145
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:39,650
supposed to do something different our

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,840
document has two modes of operation or

147
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,030
cases as they call them the Ike and I

148
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,890
class and the controller Ike is trying

149
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,640
to do something that's kind of in the

150
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:53,990
middle yes so we could are the documents

151
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,939
that we have do rekeying just fine in

152
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,430
the case then the I complementation

153
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,980
the Ricci and in the IKE list and the

154
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,170
controller has to periodically replace

155
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,360
the keys and the document supports that

156
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,439
so we don't really need controller Ike

157
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,890
for that controller Ike is kind of a

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,050
middle ground that we've seen in this de

159
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,530
in this working group and we decided not

160
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,349
to adopt and maybe some maybe it's going

161
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,170
to get adopted somewhere else in any in

162
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,660
any case we don't really need that for

163
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:41,290
our so that for the scenarios that we

164
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:47,600
are covering okay here's an agenda any

165
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:50,620
objection if not we will go move forward

166
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,650
here's basic summary of all the data

167
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:58,250
models to be created generated by this

168
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:00,380
working group the capability one that's

169
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,360
the base data model and that's like a

170
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,150
base information model which is moving

171
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,510
into is G requesting and then we have

172
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:12,160
the data model itself the data model we

173
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:16,060
have one base model and then we have

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,770
detailed at the interface we have

175
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,900
individual ones to be more detailed

176
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,900
build on top of the base model and

177
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:31,450
that's it from here I will just pass it

178
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,450
to the first presenter for the hackathon

179
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:48,110
this is from SKT you

180
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:52,000
so basically last week and my SKT you a

181
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:55,730
student and a tiara in Korea researchers

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,360
participate in I to NSF hackathon this

183
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:04,010
is a nice hackathon so amazingly our

184
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:09,379
three years nine consecutively we did a

185
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:13,749
custom so this time we try to

186
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:20,139
to demonstrate I to NSF framework and

187
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:25,339
interfaces can be used by the public

188
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:29,659
cloud platform and with commercial power

189
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:34,189
system as well as open source ricotta

190
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:39,589
for our repeater so this is the build

191
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:45,738
system this hackathon we implemented

192
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:49,669
those our draft okay except the security

193
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:53,109
policy translation document you can see

194
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:56,359
a full draft are working rotor document

195
00:11:53,109 --> 00:12:00,169
so at the beginning of this working

196
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:04,489
group session chair Linda and Yarbrough

197
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:06,499
mentioned those are there are model

198
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:11,299
draft are already laid but it might

199
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:14,029
escape you a team and modified there are

200
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:16,879
my mother dropped the plot team young

201
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:19,759
doctors reviews acceptor and as a facing

202
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,699
interface there a model dropped two

203
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:27,649
things are left so I will explain layer

204
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:31,579
the next yeah mmm there are model slides

205
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:37,159
ok so this is the poster this is my team

206
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:42,258
and including it ETA researchers ok and

207
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:46,879
also my student Chiho so this is the the

208
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:52,149
I to NSF system having an asset

209
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:54,949
framework ok so this time we have

210
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,189
commercial power it is called a wins

211
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:04,699
with providing fiber service in South

212
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:10,549
Korea and also those platform is based

213
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:12,769
on EGR I seek as Oh a cloud system is

214
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:15,978
standard for on security on earth

215
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:19,909
Social Security is everywhere yeah like

216
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:20,900
air ok that's the name is a secret it on

217
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,950
air

218
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,900
so basically you can see in the middle

219
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,120
are we have I to inaudible security

220
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,709
controller in the left hand side I to

221
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:37,339
Alaska user so here are bender manual

222
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:44,270
system especially the wind's filer

223
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:47,240
vendor providing fire perjure that

224
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:50,180
executed function also judicata web

225
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,440
filter or they are integrated on top of

226
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:59,719
public cloud system so we demonstrated

227
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:03,279
the three interfaces so they platform

228
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,860
providing you can see graphical

229
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,980
interface specify the talk security

230
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,339
function facility app ability so we

231
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,410
specify and then using rest large

232
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,410
duration interface it can be used to

233
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,680
register an SF into a security

234
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,760
controller also consumer face interface

235
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,640
is specified operator Highlander

236
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,760
security policy is specified for example

237
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:37,339
during our time employee cannot access

238
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:43,310
as NS services such as YouTube and

239
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:46,400
Facebook etc and then that our policy

240
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,609
will be translated by security

241
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:53,750
controller is fastly a security policy

242
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:56,690
translator and then that policy is

243
00:14:53,750 --> 00:15:00,650
delivered the over an SF a facing

244
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:04,070
interface so this figure shows this is

245
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,510
an entry a router and then you can see

246
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,589
this is a ricotta

247
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:12,709
this is a fiber so they are linked each

248
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:16,550
other using a service function chaining

249
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:19,719
okay and that case one we are tested the

250
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:23,719
two cases the first one is you can see

251
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,140
as soon as it Web Filter during what

252
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,810
time employee cannot access s an SNS the

253
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:33,939
social network service can access this

254
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:39,758
second one is also just a block

255
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:44,769
or access to website using this firewall

256
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:49,329
system so the lessons are we again

257
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:52,179
our system can be a loan on top of a

258
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:57,909
public cloud system as well as a

259
00:15:52,179 --> 00:16:02,728
previous our open stack a platform or so

260
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:04,059
we verified the major three interfaces

261
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:07,659
consumer-facing

262
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:11,169
NSF are facing and restoration

263
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:16,319
interfaces so we implemented on top of a

264
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:16,319
public cloud or so we showed that the

265
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:23,339
security policy change later

266
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:29,499
so security for later in my opinion very

267
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:32,289
useful tool to empower the deployment of

268
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:35,919
I turn a subsystem in the real world

269
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:39,669
because the high level young already we

270
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:42,759
are prepared for working on Rosco and

271
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:46,919
also and I have a facing especially

272
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:49,859
divisive facing interface young model

273
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:53,499
those high-level young model and

274
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:57,849
laudable young model can be linked using

275
00:16:53,499 --> 00:17:02,979
this translator so I will explain the

276
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:06,129
last talk in this session so again we

277
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:08,620
integrated the I to era subsystem on top

278
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:12,698
of our commercial platform with the

279
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:18,658
commercial fire that is I think a very

280
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:22,149
good ok our progress so this is a video

281
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:26,980
script so you can visit and then you can

282
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:29,439
see the nice video clip to show whole

283
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:34,059
process a registered NSF and also

284
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:37,809
specify user on high-level policy also

285
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:40,120
we can show the process of translation

286
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:43,869
and also we can demonstrate the two

287
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:47,709
cases the Web Filter and the fiber so

288
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:52,600
this is open source project so

289
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:54,910
the benders and operator also other

290
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,149
universities it can take advantage of

291
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:02,860
our work project because we share all

292
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:07,770
sorts crota ok that's it thank you yeah

293
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:11,800
thank you very much that's a really good

294
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:16,120
was hi Kazan demonstration actually in

295
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:19,210
um I talked to Paul yesterday we

296
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,679
probably will introduce this heck uh

297
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:25,690
sound to the Owen ug they have us

298
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,640
security Software Defined security

299
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:32,170
services I think this will be a good

300
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,020
reference thank you ok well hi you have

301
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,310
mirror from the floor no hats so I think

302
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,280
it's very encouraging that you're

303
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:43,690
working with the commercial firewall and

304
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,360
I you think that usually be able to work

305
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,760
with other commercial fair especially

306
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,610
the more popular ones like from Cisco

307
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:56,170
and Palo Alto and former employer that I

308
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:57,850
shall not mentioned or is this ok winds

309
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,240
is one that I've never heard about

310
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,750
before yeah Korea yet some some company

311
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,440
yes oh maybe not international right so

312
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:12,010
but it is a famous in Korea yeah so I

313
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,920
think the Cisco or some juniper orderly

314
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:18,970
offenders case in order to integrate

315
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:22,450
their fiber they needed to implement an

316
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:26,670
SFO facing interface also restoration

317
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:30,340
interface so if they are willing to

318
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:35,080
implement that we can definitely test

319
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:43,120
yeah together yeah okay thank you okay

320
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:46,030
the echo developers is about because I

321
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,850
this morning I was discussing with the

322
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,129
chair of the energy about the intent

323
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,889
base and relax one of the things that we

324
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,620
are looking for is precisely way of

325
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:58,000
somehow formalizing I mean intent

326
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,080
language is no intent because in

327
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,590
formalizing internists

328
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,960
is an endless task but the VA was

329
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,570
precisely to try to find some common

330
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,400
patterns and come on semantics in the do

331
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,580
you have the formal definition of the

332
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,690
language you use the the ideology I mean

333
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:21,189
for the definition of the policies alike

334
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:26,900
so that is a question so you can see the

335
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:28,790
let's see consumer patient interface so

336
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:33,700
you can see consumer facing interface

337
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:36,740
the basic important thing is the EC a

338
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,680
policy you right so according to that

339
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,540
issue a policy rule and our consumer

340
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,850
facing interfaces they're a young model

341
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:49,250
so this interface is just one tool map

342
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,399
so it was actually according to that

343
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,710
Tara young model so in order to provide

344
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,520
the intent to base the security service

345
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:03,950
currently my illiteracy lab also has

346
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:06,020
interest in it we need to process for

347
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,800
example link naturally in the processing

348
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:12,950
point and perform user specify more

349
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,950
flexible the specification of a policy

350
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:19,460
we needed to understand right so line

351
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,380
now we just I want to a map ok so so for

352
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:26,810
the let's say intent individual use

353
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:30,140
exactly easy a no no I mean it's a it's

354
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:32,149
a thing that this could be a valid model

355
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,640
at least at for the underlying semantics

356
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:44,290
in most cases so okay okay thank you

357
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:44,290
yeah so let's move on the theorem model

358
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,779
[Music]

359
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,199
[Music]

360
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:38,570
hi hello yes whispering okay can you

361
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,159
hear me

362
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,139
we hear you very well okay thank you

363
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:48,570
purple I think the light is not very

364
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:53,480
good as I own it I think it's not well

365
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,480
blame France pain morning

366
00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:02,250
okay let's go next this is developer to

367
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:08,220
the University of bottom and I'm going

368
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:12,630
to present the last updates of the SDM

369
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:16,950
protection a basic prohibition yeah well

370
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:22,169
first just a quick summary of the last

371
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:25,830
changes now from version 3 to version 4

372
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:30,410
now we have two names for cases we have

373
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:33,750
the ID case and the eyeglass case and

374
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:37,110
perhaps the main changes that now we

375
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:40,919
have divided the model in three parts we

376
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:46,830
have the exact common model with the

377
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:53,669
container and groupings types which are

378
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:57,139
used by the Mike yet in class we have

379
00:23:53,669 --> 00:24:06,270
also they may be sick ID model and a

380
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:10,070
Miss a modulus the next please okay now

381
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:13,400
yes summary of the changes from verse

382
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:16,760
fourteen version

383
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:21,110
well first we have addressed all the

384
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:25,190
comments from Martins from the doctor we

385
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:29,479
have improved the description of every

386
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:34,430
element models and we have also enabled

387
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:41,809
the format of all the models we have

388
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:45,920
addressed also we have comments from

389
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:51,790
others and also from Tarot thanks again

390
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,790
for your indeed variation for review

391
00:24:52,520 --> 00:25:01,370
we have update we have simplified map

392
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,370
irrigation or necklace case we have

393
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:10,820
simplified the x-pyr acquire

394
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:14,678
notification and we have a 10-year dafuk

395
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:21,470
Asian in order to represent to allow the

396
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:31,030
security function near series of

397
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:31,030
overflow also notify number

398
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:42,740
next please well we have also simplified

399
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:49,010
the data in both the request case but

400
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:58,520
mainly in my case where we have stated

401
00:25:49,010 --> 00:26:05,710
data and try to move the details of the

402
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:08,960
child is unique in case we have also

403
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:17,440
improved the security considerations

404
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:23,140
section in order to try to define the

405
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,140
security requirements that the

406
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,569
[Music]

407
00:26:45,990 --> 00:27:58,890
we have yes we have the security

408
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:58,890
controller has referenced the number

409
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:08,560
this topic is under discussion in the

410
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:12,790
working group don't know if there is any

411
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:17,360
yoga regarding the meeting that you had

412
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:21,139
yesterday there you have it

413
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:26,510
for the encryption algorithm type where

414
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:29,230
there's some typos and still do you

415
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:49,750
detect it you have to make use of the

416
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:56,030
new in 1632 next okay we have also

417
00:28:49,750 --> 00:29:00,020
examples the current version of a draft

418
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:02,540
include a tea cakes example or we may

419
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,210
need of tunnel mode in our gateway to

420
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:08,690
get with this scenario and making use of

421
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:12,730
X dot file online certification of

422
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:15,940
dedication there is also a little X

423
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:20,440
example in this case making use of

424
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:25,040
transport mode in a host host scenario

425
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:28,040
with PHP authentication and we also

426
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:32,240
provide examples of the type of

427
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:43,639
notification that now are included in my

428
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:48,370
classes next please ok we have validated

429
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:55,580
the model maybe it'll be done following

430
00:29:48,370 --> 00:30:00,409
the rules specified by Martin and my the

431
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:04,120
German model requirements we have also

432
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:08,210
test the model in this free environment

433
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:12,760
where we are able to install three

434
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:15,440
models and finally we have validate the

435
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:20,420
examples included in the draft making

436
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:28,280
use of the Terminator interpretation

437
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:33,020
next please well finally our idea is

438
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:36,440
- yes to submit a new version sm6

439
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:40,760
because in the last days we have had

440
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,950
some email exchanges with many with

441
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,040
bodily Thank You battery called the

442
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,270
comments we want to clarify some text in

443
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:54,940
the draft

444
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:54,940
also we have to to fill the a

445
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:03,170
consideration section and it's

446
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:10,160
everything ok then finally to request

447
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:24,920
the publication a es and that's all you

448
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:27,140
have a question so because you've

449
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:31,630
mentioned you're running code directly

450
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:37,010
say a few words about that about their

451
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:40,850
writing code yes we have the source

452
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:44,210
codes to test the model currently this

453
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,179
source code is based on the previous

454
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:53,510
version but we have to update the code

455
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:58,040
to this last version well we are waiting

456
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:59,900
to have more stable draft version

457
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,240
because the changes from the last

458
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,330
version to this one are are very

459
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,000
intensive changes so already I list you

460
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,909
to adapt the source code the link to the

461
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,510
Egypt repository was presented in the

462
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:19,790
last meter but if you need them I can

463
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:24,590
send an it again to the Middle East the

464
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:28,220
problem just for the record this is

465
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:31,090
developers again we have had a student

466
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:34,160
working with us here in this last term

467
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:38,530
and what we're done is using the code

468
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:42,760
these guys emoji has a half precisely to

469
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:47,810
implement key decisions

470
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:50,360
well an IPSec distribution or set up

471
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:53,330
schema for anything so what does that

472
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,580
make a deployment using our the mobile

473
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:00,740
say we have a using own or network

474
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:03,230
street or SM to deploy a vnfs that that

475
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,430
communicate can use IPSec as defining

476
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:11,680
the model so what we try to measure is a

477
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:16,490
demonstrating that it is applicable in

478
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:20,810
in the case of any V deployment and

479
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,530
based on control service models yes

480
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:26,030
thank you

481
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:26,520
we are waiting for the new word thank

482
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,549
you

483
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,549
[Music]

484
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:42,070
okay yeah thank you Cabrillo okay thank

485
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,070
you everyone

486
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:18,399
hello everyone again this is a pearl

487
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:21,690
from skq so basically the five there are

488
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:25,629
young mothers are updated also I

489
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:28,679
submitted during this alarm okay

490
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:34,529
question I submitted a libyan letter

491
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:40,480
with the device the attractor linked to

492
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:47,049
each of a young doctors who gave us the

493
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:51,010
lip you okay so basically our data

494
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:55,750
models are come to the information model

495
00:34:51,010 --> 00:35:01,559
tractable and as a cop abilities so the

496
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:06,490
first three the base young model is the

497
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:12,750
sous-sous capability data model based on

498
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:16,259
that we providing full interfaces

499
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:21,490
especially consumer pays interface and

500
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:24,569
another facing laceration interfaces

501
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:28,390
also NSF were monitoring therapist is

502
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:30,880
Lionel the you can see the first cop

503
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:35,859
ability data model and second third

504
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:39,279
force consumer NSF facing laceration

505
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:42,299
interfaces error models are devised

506
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:48,460
according to a young doctors are comment

507
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:52,930
so we had a nine I kept a hackathon

508
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:56,470
project last three years and we already

509
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:59,558
deport times during a zone so my

510
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:01,709
students are encouraged with these kinds

511
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:06,150
overs okay thank you

512
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:08,309
so we updated according to a young

513
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:11,030
doctor so we are the most over here

514
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:13,740
comment our address

515
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:17,309
except and as a facing interface there

516
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:23,430
are motor case to comment the first one

517
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:26,339
is so the access control list young or

518
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:29,759
module has the overlap test some

519
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:35,869
definition or with our Ellison facing so

520
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:40,730
we needed to import the use the SEL

521
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:44,220
definition so but it takes time so we

522
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:46,819
reflected that one last probably next

523
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:52,339
our Wednesday we the plug the tap

524
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:52,339
replacement or second one also

525
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,260
Susanne's our capability data model and

526
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:02,190
SFO facing the error murder case we

527
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:05,069
define deprecatory which means another

528
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:08,970
face in case we define again so young

529
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:11,759
doctor are saying why don't you use cop

530
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,980
ability data are modules definition so

531
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,470
we will use so those are I think is that

532
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,390
the power that we can leap like one week

533
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,220
enough and then we can divide estimate

534
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:23,069
and then we can ask for a what your

535
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,410
escort but other consumer facing and

536
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:30,750
registration interface are ready for

537
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:33,029
what were last call I believe so I agree

538
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:36,390
much I explained so the capability

539
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:39,569
theorem our model case the major comment

540
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:42,440
is about the security considerations we

541
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:46,200
tried to use recommend in the temple and

542
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:50,660
also we added the two things so possible

543
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:56,689
attack related to mobility data module

544
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,690
so we are added to our sentences okay

545
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:05,369
next data and time case already are

546
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,379
built in time so we just use the

547
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:10,530
disability and terror and time letter

548
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,260
that we defined again and also or we had

549
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,490
some misleading to finish on time zone

550
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,560
so our intention is

551
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:20,410
the time interval some interval start

552
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:26,140
time starting time and end time so we'd

553
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:29,160
apply step Tom so we'll place time zone

554
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:33,390
with the time intervals so a CL number

555
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,040
is not used so we delete and

556
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:39,700
descriptions are improved according to

557
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,920
young doctor is a comment again the

558
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:46,560
security consideration we added okay I

559
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:49,150
previous on the I so to write and then

560
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,420
another facing this second one okay and

561
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:58,750
that's a facing case other comment or

562
00:38:52,420 --> 00:39:02,790
yet addressed the but you can see the

563
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:09,730
ACL especially some definition this is a

564
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:14,110
so ACL so pack imagine case we use the

565
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:16,000
ACL definition and secondly I mentioned

566
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,850
the co-operative data model and as a

567
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,859
facing the other model are there have

568
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:26,529
they have a common definition we just

569
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:28,600
defined cavalli data model and MS

570
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,750
effacing just will be used in pi in

571
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:36,609
protein okay so those are I think we can

572
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:40,020
do next several days and then we can be

573
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:42,759
eyes and SME the consumer patient case

574
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,150
really devised according to young but

575
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,670
the major thing is accessor control so

576
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:53,500
policy management was authentication

577
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:57,970
method we can using list so we can

578
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:59,040
accommodate a possible awesome case of

579
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:03,819
Macerata

580
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:07,090
so the time is it yeah now list the

581
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:12,609
letter then huh I think a container and

582
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:15,820
then laceration interface so research an

583
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,240
interface the case really buys a young

584
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,390
doctor

585
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,669
so we revise the young module structure

586
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,859
according to the guideline so this is

587
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:28,480
young the developers

588
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:31,420
title line so we leave iced and also we

589
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,390
using it more you can see a natural

590
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,970
isolation prefix yeah previously a

591
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:40,000
leader job come confusing some prefixes

592
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:44,500
are we using this griffix minor issue

593
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,410
and and then previously we didn't ask

594
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:51,070
for the ipv6 address now we support IP

595
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:57,629
version 6 address as well as I keep Adam

596
00:40:51,070 --> 00:41:01,420
for us and then we revise the example ok

597
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:04,330
IP version 6 addresses allowed ok and

598
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,040
also a nest reporter at the recipe and

599
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,779
change the NSF report because it is

600
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,440
misleading because we have already

601
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:14,619
addressed so we change the NSA book port

602
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,780
that toxic we function port and we

603
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:21,970
revised security considerations

604
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:26,320
according to Caroline and I said for

605
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:28,899
monitoring at era model case is not lady

606
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:33,760
for working or last call so we are

607
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:38,500
planning to implement and show pro

608
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:42,480
concept next Singapore meeting so my

609
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:45,300
student and other university social

610
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,840
University I believe that two

611
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:54,300
universities are working for the NSF

612
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:56,770
monitoring terror model so next step is

613
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:01,600
capability there are model of this money

614
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:02,609
our chair of already the cast the iced

615
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,730
tea

616
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:10,299
evaluation so and then other document

617
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:13,359
the case consumer facing reservations

618
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,340
page I believe our lady for walking

619
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,090
guarulhos coal and and as a facing

620
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,050
interface case we can wait until two a

621
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:24,190
major issue

622
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:27,990
just some detector ring and the the use

623
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:31,230
of a structure so after that I will let

624
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:33,310
terrorists to working or let's call a

625
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:37,060
monitoring case I mentioned that we

626
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:41,470
preparing for testing and for next the

627
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:43,810
Singapore IT have a meeting okay

628
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:46,419
this is appendices I believe you guys

629
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,910
can take a look so we can show command

630
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:53,380
old and new tech - something like that

631
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:55,868
so you can take a look if you question

632
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:00,310
Frisian em you know I think I asked the

633
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:03,970
young doctors helping these revision

634
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:07,060
details and then if they have a son

635
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:09,939
comment they'll let us know and then we

636
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:20,109
can deflect his comments or also her

637
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:22,869
comments thank you yes so my students

638
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:27,180
are working very hard so I appreciate

639
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:30,490
that they Rock yeah so David we have

640
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:42,160
comments or questions although there you

641
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:45,930
have developers again is about the

642
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,879
registration interface so the document I

643
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:51,759
sent you an email yesterday probably you

644
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,160
have not seen it yet I have today I have

645
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,770
checked that has 700 ok emails waiting

646
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,960
for me and I imagine that they save the

647
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:01,619
case of most of us in the case of the

648
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:06,820
registration interface Annie's

649
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:09,849
discussing in Pratt about pointing from

650
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:16,359
the when the registration of a

651
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:18,820
capabilities made a pointer to the the

652
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:21,460
Jan Mobile of the gen model fragment

653
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:23,470
that can be used precisely to control

654
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,960
that capability in another model so is a

655
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,669
link well did you remember we were

656
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:34,570
talking about the idea abuse in this

657
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:37,089
jang jae myung mount scheme amount to

658
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,599
make that reference i would like to see

659
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:42,099
if this can be used because at the end

660
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,480
would support the translation process

661
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:47,170
like the one you are working

662
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,960
yeah that if you want to touch this

663
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,790
capability go do to this more specific

664
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,540
one that it would be the let's say the

665
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:57,640
part of the BNSF facing interface

666
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:02,310
damn useful for managing the capability

667
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,310
simply okay okay good yeah okay

668
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:10,270
also the one thing is that we are all

669
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:14,560
three interfaces are specified I turn

670
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:16,960
except IPSec so so line out we are we

671
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:24,190
can use the IPSec as you are yeah okay

672
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:26,140
okay just remember precisely one

673
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:28,870
dimension is a bit second row it would

674
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:32,799
be probably interesting to show that I

675
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:34,270
mean the most detail a schema Jiang

676
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,640
schema we have right now is precisely

677
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:39,670
from the FOV IPSec well Gabi was

678
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,009
presenting probably would be nice to

679
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,960
have in the registration interface to

680
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:46,390
that to add an example to say well for

681
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,730
these capability we can point to these

682
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:52,750
other scheme and we were showing how we

683
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:56,980
are relating both documents what what

684
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:59,920
John I mean they be able to be precisely

685
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,130
to say we have these guys from Murcia

686
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,530
are doing a young schema for managing

687
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,360
all the IPSec it would be about I define

688
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,430
at least one capability there is

689
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:16,120
capability described like that that is

690
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:20,200
about I don't know I guess or I say set

691
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:23,650
up both linked to this piece of there

692
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,939
and show a schema mount the boot

693
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:30,160
provided okay so so we can schema or not

694
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:33,670
accommodate I said to you to me the area

695
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,440
so she showed me to show that is an

696
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:39,130
example because it would be a good way

697
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:42,240
of making a self-contained set of

698
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,240
documentation okay

699
00:46:49,640 --> 00:47:12,810
okay aroma oh yeah okay okay okay okay

700
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:24,330
so we can move on okay doc a security

701
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:28,500
policy translation okay so I think the

702
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:31,740
security policy translation in I to NSF

703
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:35,760
is important part of our security

704
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:38,240
controller because the high level e

705
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,370
Young and the low level young are

706
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,640
specified in our working group the

707
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:47,750
problem is how to link to each other

708
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:52,799
also how to translate so this document

709
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:56,030
we specify the link is between two young

710
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,990
data model and also be providing

711
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:00,480
implementation high trying for

712
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:04,680
architectural translation and also

713
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,230
process of translation so the motivation

714
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,450
of our draft years you can see in the

715
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:12,180
middle you can see plot my son's

716
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:15,390
computers were a smartphone from a

717
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:18,120
malicious website so this is a kind of

718
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:19,680
intent Diego mentioned the right so this

719
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,700
is a high level and intent

720
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:27,390
so our hackathon case we provide a

721
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:30,359
graphical interface to put some this

722
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:35,750
kind of my son's a computer and

723
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:39,540
malicious website so this my son's and

724
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:42,570
malicious websites are called the

725
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:45,240
endpoint information okay so somehow we

726
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:49,590
need to so right now we are using

727
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:52,229
proprietary some method to populate this

728
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:56,490
information into security our

729
00:48:52,230 --> 00:49:00,930
controllers NSF database okay but

730
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:03,009
secondly given this policy our core is

731
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,649
we in

732
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:08,410
horse into the truck security function

733
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:11,680
such as a fire and repeater so drop

734
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:16,029
packets from my son's this IP addresses

735
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:19,810
used by my son's computer so the

736
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:24,220
malicious websites on Sunni militia

737
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:28,660
websites are hung calm and illegal calm

738
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:31,959
maybe we can have more if we specify

739
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:37,149
using and the find information in the PC

740
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:40,960
interface so the goal is given this high

741
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:44,170
level policy we translate into this low

742
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:48,460
level policy right most of the file

743
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:51,760
filter case this IP address and this URL

744
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:54,190
are specified rather than my son's

745
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:59,680
computers and malicious websites right

746
00:49:54,190 --> 00:50:03,690
so the core is how to translate so so we

747
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:07,450
providing the some compiler Sharia

748
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:12,160
translation so we these are protocol

749
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:14,819
which we provide easier security policy

750
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:20,560
construction we don't need care or

751
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:24,280
selection or Apple appropriate NSF what

752
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:27,460
kind of NSF are are required to provided

753
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:30,370
this holiday policy and the secondly

754
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:34,960
efficient maintenance okay in the past

755
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:37,750
that we can use it XSLT is a user to map

756
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,170
her labor yang examiner AR this is a

757
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:44,230
kinda hard coded but our approach case

758
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:50,040
we provide more flexible or link however

759
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:56,110
young and reliever young so previously

760
00:50:50,040 --> 00:51:00,090
some our ad alone yeah long right you

761
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:02,980
mentioned this draft of the case

762
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:04,750
apparently looks like a soft engineers

763
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,650
of the judgment like that data why we

764
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:10,870
try to we adding some new section

765
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,150
explain the mapping list orbit era and

766
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:15,279
motor peers to share that

767
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:16,630
consumer-facing interface and an SFA's

768
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,110
interface okay

769
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:24,940
so this is a disarm a thing so this is

770
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:27,180
an NSF populate the information entity

771
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:31,480
this is enter point such as a my son's

772
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:34,930
computer or some malicious website okay

773
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,540
oh yeah yeah room engineer so back to

774
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:42,580
the mapping why does that mapping me to

775
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:45,490
be standardized so because without the

776
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:49,319
mapping the designer overstocked

777
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:52,330
engineer the figuring out so our

778
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:54,760
sometimes the mapping is not one-to-one

779
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:59,279
sometimes I want too many something like

780
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:03,370
that so in the case we specify the

781
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,560
consumer-facing and NSF Amy I'm not I'm

782
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:08,920
aware of that but developer can lead our

783
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:12,070
or tracked case it will be the harder

784
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:15,310
time to figure out how can map or how to

785
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:18,790
link to each other so that's why we come

786
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:20,560
up with this draft no I I think I

787
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:22,230
understand the gap as in what the

788
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,520
software engineer doesn't understand and

789
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,560
designer the way you can explain it but

790
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,550
why but that would that all seems like

791
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,140
that would happen in the same

792
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,210
organization building the controller

793
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,310
right so why do we need to standardize

794
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:35,680
this typically when we do that because

795
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,450
there's lots of different parties or

796
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,790
vendors who we want you into operating

797
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:41,410
with not that we want to standardize the

798
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:45,630
different kind of roles inside the

799
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:49,359
organization because you can see this er

800
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:51,580
entity relation therapist case so this

801
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:58,090
information should to be populated by

802
00:52:51,580 --> 00:53:00,670
some operator side and also this NSF

803
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:03,790
capability case provided the vendors

804
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:06,460
right so they need the tools this data

805
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:08,710
structure should be shared by each other

806
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,320
and what kind of fields are should be

807
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:14,380
are populated without that it is a

808
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:17,880
difficult to translate so somehow we

809
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:21,820
need to define the relation between

810
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:24,810
capability base and some endpoint

811
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:27,720
information so this is the first

812
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:31,250
the second one is this mapping you can

813
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:34,859
see the first line is a consumer facing

814
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:38,370
for example if I were a red filter case

815
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:40,410
my son's source eventually I feel there

816
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:44,509
should be treasure light to write this

817
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:48,120
okay so now this is a consumer facing

818
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:51,090
entity this is another face entity so

819
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,730
these guys are mapping information is

820
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:57,030
blissfully specified that is documented

821
00:53:53,730 --> 00:54:00,900
so developer can easily understand how

822
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:10,590
to implement their yet translator okay

823
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:12,930
so that yeah so Roman I all to try to I

824
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,810
was encouraging him to try to put this

825
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:18,270
actually out as a standard you remember

826
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:21,900
that earlier this week I mentioned we're

827
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:24,950
trying to import some of the work from I

828
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,520
to us or some of the concepts into this

829
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:29,069
secure VPN

830
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,920
I was hoping an example like this might

831
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:37,470
give them an idea now I don't know if

832
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:39,570
this goes on in the security realm to be

833
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:42,959
a published standard or for just getting

834
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:45,390
information to help us bootstrap my my

835
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,440
concern is to see some examples so that

836
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:52,799
as we get into a bgp secure VPNs that i

837
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,860
have some examples to point to so i'm

838
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,740
pleased to see this model and this work

839
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:01,260
because it gives an example of how

840
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,689
things might work for translation and

841
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:07,440
that's a difficult part okay so i'm i'm

842
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:10,020
i'm happy to see this for a different

843
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,820
reason than the security vendors i you

844
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,920
know you're straight security vendors

845
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:17,340
i'm happy to see it because I'm working

846
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,910
with routing security VPNs and this may

847
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,980
give some clue whether it is or not that

848
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:25,799
depends on how security vendors look and

849
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:29,310
how the application and they go may have

850
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:31,860
more comments on that but I've clarify

851
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,619
to the author this is the information no

852
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:44,279
draft this is an information

853
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:45,990
that I develop is the sorry thanks for

854
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:49,980
that clarification I did not notice that

855
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:53,240
that was information okay what they

856
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:57,859
think is that these I mean this is a

857
00:55:53,240 --> 00:56:02,479
soos this is available as an example

858
00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:06,348
what I think we should try to

859
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:10,380
standardize is how we define or how we

860
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:12,359
serialize these mappings so is about the

861
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,859
mechanisms for showing the mappings not

862
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:16,410
about the mapping themselves because the

863
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:18,538
mapping themselves will be application

864
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:22,019
specific or even or even a function

865
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:24,390
specific and even this would be

866
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:27,209
applicable not only in the case of

867
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:31,319
security would be applicable you know in

868
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:32,849
all other cases and well I see it very

869
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:35,490
much connected and you know we have been

870
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:38,670
talking about this I see this very much

871
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:43,049
connected with some activities that have

872
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:44,999
being discussed to start here in this

873
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:52,009
meeting with us in a couple set meetings

874
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:55,410
and the net mod group etc about well

875
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:59,809
bring in Jang one or a couple of steps

876
00:56:55,410 --> 00:57:02,489
forward so it can be more useful for for

877
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:03,930
we are nature operations and one of the

878
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:07,200
things is precisely how do you build

879
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:09,598
these kind of mappings from one model to

880
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,939
another one model that is let's say has

881
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,999
a higher level of abstraction down to

882
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:17,220
one that is have a lower level of

883
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:20,038
abstraction on how you which are the

884
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:21,959
mechanisms to show these relationship

885
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:25,680
not not to be not the reason just

886
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:30,089
ourselves but how do to make the the

887
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,980
binding okay yeah so point of

888
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:33,480
clarification the draft as I'm currently

889
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,779
reading it says standards track or

890
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:40,009
probably I need some type of so I really

891
00:57:36,779 --> 00:57:44,099
change information okay thank you yeah

892
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:47,730
hello friends AHA so sorry I haven't a

893
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:54,720
real very clear it heard about this talk

894
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:57,630
but my current feeling is that if of

895
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,600
course this document we're happy with

896
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:04,800
where for this work but I think only

897
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:07,710
when the document does not only cover

898
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:10,590
the mapping between the you know within

899
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:14,090
the customer-facing

900
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:16,920
interface motor to the nacelle facing

901
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:19,670
interface latemodel I think the more

902
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,619
important the part of the better way to

903
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:26,430
write this document should be you should

904
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:30,480
write something about your your internal

905
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:32,430
architecture design and you know the

906
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,280
process how to do the magic that the

907
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:38,310
general way to do the mapping but not

908
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:42,300
the man you deserve okay so that that

909
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:44,460
that that we are wearable contribution

910
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:48,710
to the industry because I can see that

911
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:52,290
not only you nitro and safe in a lot of

912
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:56,190
service provision motor we have two two

913
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:58,770
levels of service murderer or you know

914
00:58:56,190 --> 00:59:01,430
that data model we need this kind of

915
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:05,759
general mapping we can either in any

916
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:08,609
controller right so I'm more hoping to

917
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:14,880
see these kind of things but not only

918
00:59:08,609 --> 00:59:17,580
the mapping you know and another another

919
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,090
point I want to see in this document is

920
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:23,790
if you of course you can give some

921
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:27,810
example from the item assess perspective

922
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:29,520
for how to translate the security

923
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:34,440
service model to the security

924
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:38,009
configuration motor but which gives some

925
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,900
more advanced examples because you know

926
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:44,910
for Cepeda you just keep a very very

927
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:48,119
simple example but actually we want to

928
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:50,879
see that for example if you from the

929
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:54,630
end-to-end the way to see a security

930
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,430
service maybe in in the in the in the

931
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:58,680
past there are several security

932
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:01,529
functions and how we turn them together

933
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:04,770
and how we map this kind of

934
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:08,520
very very huge remoter to the you know

935
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:12,630
to the to the several part of models on

936
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:15,450
the on the sale facing motor so maybe i

937
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:19,220
think that know that example will be be

938
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:22,980
more youthful bit more representative so

939
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:27,290
basically currently we explain a simple

940
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:31,140
web filter or so we can combine fire and

941
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:33,120
repeater logging together so yeah

942
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:36,779
definitely the solid function cheney in

943
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:40,410
case we needed two more improve the

944
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:43,140
example but you mentioned so you can see

945
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:45,120
this is the architecture of security

946
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:48,089
policy translator so we improve this

947
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:51,359
example but given this kind of

948
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:53,430
architecture process vendors can easily

949
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,190
implement this morning

950
01:00:53,430 --> 01:01:01,109
somehow engineer i forgot his name but

951
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:04,380
he working for an AC pn that they are

952
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:06,510
doing right given some requirement that

953
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:11,460
they try to compete rollable

954
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:14,610
and transport network right so they how

955
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:19,460
me and also i met yesterday he also

956
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:23,370
working for HTM he has also lots of

957
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:26,250
interest in this rock but in my opinion

958
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:28,259
we tried to focus on this concrete

959
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:31,710
example I told as a first and then we

960
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:35,040
can generalize if we broaden at this

961
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:37,500
moment I think maybe it takes two or

962
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,529
three years who knows because this is

963
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,780
not easy job but we tried to publish

964
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:45,330
this information or alpha C and then TC

965
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,990
will be starting a point for other area

966
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:51,690
that's my key when you focus on the

967
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:54,479
alternative a specific mode or something

968
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:59,430
but I think you also you still need to

969
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:04,110
give us a general general way or general

970
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:06,960
system how it'll work to do this mapping

971
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:09,210
so actually yes so that the map on there

972
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,109
that maybe is not important but the way

973
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:14,289
how to do this mapping seem hot

974
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:16,779
that is youthful and that can be the

975
01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:20,950
Ojibwa for future your skates do ya

976
01:02:16,779 --> 01:02:23,559
clarify how to map means some given the

977
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:28,629
higher level yeah Laura boyoung

978
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:31,359
so how to map some some leaf node to

979
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:34,829
some other leaf node link automatically

980
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:37,660
so what do you mean by your yeah

981
01:02:34,829 --> 01:02:40,599
matching so I can understand that your

982
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:42,670
what do you mean by so currently we we

983
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:45,970
are this is not a machine learning

984
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:48,520
risers operator or populate the mapping

985
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:53,140
information manually into a database

986
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:55,150
okay so maybe in the future so given her

987
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:59,710
live a young low-level young machine

988
01:02:55,150 --> 01:03:02,529
learning case can figure out but I think

989
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:05,020
it takes several years who knows I don't

990
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:07,809
know and so but actually I have an

991
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:10,000
interest in it but line now I try to

992
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:14,670
using some more rule-based some mapping

993
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:20,230
is a feasible approach to right now yeah

994
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:23,069
okay okay thank you yeah yeah yeah thank

995
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:28,930
you so much Paul I'm gonna ask Franco a

996
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:30,520
clarifying question that's okay okay so

997
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:33,669
Frank my understanding is that you

998
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,710
treasure the the ability to have the

999
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:40,990
architecture and the methodology of

1000
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:43,420
doing the translation between the the

1001
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:46,509
high level yang data extractor and the

1002
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:49,569
policy detail but what you really are

1003
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:51,309
looking is for the draft to specify the

1004
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:58,960
work is simply an example did I

1005
01:03:51,309 --> 01:04:02,740
understand you're coming I think you're

1006
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:05,740
right you understand my point I my point

1007
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:07,959
is that the the example is not our goal

1008
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:10,930
right the example is just to illustrate

1009
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,970
or clarify how we do this kind of

1010
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:15,339
formatting and I hope that this week and

1011
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:19,149
we have pickable to other use cases for

1012
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:22,390
other you know policy making so so that

1013
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:24,910
so that can that way are we increase the

1014
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:27,009
value of the document address the one

1015
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:29,470
trying to help you to make your document

1016
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:31,630
to be more variable if it's only fit for

1017
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:36,160
suitable for the eye to answer those

1018
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:42,630
cases may be useful but it's not so

1019
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:46,540
useful so again from the use case that I

1020
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:49,270
have with another set of work I'm doing

1021
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:52,740
and routing this general use case is

1022
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:55,870
helpful for understanding high-level

1023
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:59,890
capability policy high level policy that

1024
01:04:55,870 --> 01:05:02,950
we've developed for security especially

1025
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:05,500
in the some of the IPSec stuff and how

1026
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:07,299
to translate it so I appreciated this

1027
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:10,390
document where the working group takes

1028
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:13,680
it what the ad does with it it the fact

1029
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:16,660
that it's currently existing is helpful

1030
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:19,569
okay so thanks for your clarification so

1031
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:23,680
you you kill me some more confidence

1032
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:25,360
okay okay go ahead yeah live room

1033
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,830
engineer pulling the thread that I think

1034
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,390
Frank keyed up around the architecture I

1035
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:30,700
just wanted to ask a clarifying question

1036
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:32,470
the documents I've seen to date for my

1037
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,629
to NSF and as I kind of read the Charter

1038
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:37,060
it was primarily first enumerate the

1039
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:39,250
architecture which was drop the boxes

1040
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:41,380
you know conceptually on a piece of

1041
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:43,390
paper and then a lot of the work was

1042
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:46,240
then describing what is the role those

1043
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:48,339
boxes and then what goes in and out of

1044
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,990
those boxes so describe kind of the

1045
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:52,510
information flow the api's and then

1046
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:56,290
describe the data models is that

1047
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:57,130
accurate yes okay so as I read this this

1048
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,860
strikes me as something different

1049
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:02,260
because for the first time we're going

1050
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:05,230
inside one of those boxes so it's now

1051
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:08,110
not the API in and out of the box it's

1052
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:10,960
about what's happening inside the box is

1053
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:13,540
that conceptually right so we're not

1054
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,220
defining a new API that kind of goes in

1055
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:18,100
and out or not defining the data model

1056
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:21,819
in out it's about something inside right

1057
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:25,360
yeah okay so the the thing is alone I

1058
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:28,780
think left the three years a hackathon

1059
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:31,330
project so I think this translation is I

1060
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:35,680
think at a very usable part I want to

1061
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:38,619
share to ITF our community so this can

1062
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:42,069
be expanded for the general

1063
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:46,210
for some Network comparation there is a

1064
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:49,329
disparity so I believe we need to decide

1065
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:51,130
we can adopt this or work for AI 12s the

1066
01:06:49,329 --> 01:06:53,710
security first and they expanded to

1067
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:56,469
other area so that is a mind yeah so

1068
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,640
that's chant yeah yeah that's how I mean

1069
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:59,769
I'm asking that clarifying question cuz

1070
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,450
that seems like a different scope and we

1071
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:03,218
might want to talk about what that means

1072
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:05,769
relative to the Charter so I'd want to

1073
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,969
give it a quick look okay so I agree

1074
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,348
with the utility of everything you're

1075
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:13,299
describing to practically implemented

1076
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:18,819
okay okay thank you yeah okay thank you

1077
01:07:13,299 --> 01:07:22,569
very much may I ask for escort melena

1078
01:07:18,819 --> 01:07:36,219
stand then we can decide we our group or

1079
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:39,460
pursue this work or not and also

1080
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:43,229
adoption course I'm sorry yeah yeah yeah

1081
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,229
adoption yeah not less sorry

1082
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:56,069
and please get us the results of the

1083
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:56,069
squint a on the mailing list

1084
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:28,230
right so we go through all of them Linda

1085
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:32,250
we go through all four crustaceans okay

1086
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:44,429
so I guess it's time for open mic or any

1087
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:48,930
other businesses sometimes called okay

1088
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:51,330
this is a poor from s Kiki so the line

1089
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:54,560
now our long mention under the chatter

1090
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:58,740
maybe we can take a look chatter so

1091
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:01,620
basically as I understand our I to NSF

1092
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:05,339
is focus on framework and the inter

1093
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:11,910
pieces and those are our primary our

1094
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:15,120
course may be after our the main primary

1095
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:15,540
tasks such as we are polishing or in two

1096
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,589
pieces

1097
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:22,470
there are models and then maybe we can

1098
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:26,279
the chatter consider some year of

1099
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:28,500
deployment over I to NSF I think at the

1100
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:30,990
security policy translated up one thing

1101
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:34,740
the other thing is during our Harrison

1102
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:36,750
project so the interaction with other

1103
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:40,950
systems such as the US embassy sub

1104
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:44,180
function chaining also STM controller

1105
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:49,319
the kind of interface that are not

1106
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:55,080
specified so to realize I to MSF maybe a

1107
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:57,809
we can add new item there our model for

1108
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:01,890
those SF PCI to an SF interaction

1109
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:06,870
I told us ASTM interaction yeah that is

1110
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:09,150
a my suggestion yeah I have never just

1111
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:11,760
not to mention that I've a couple of

1112
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:12,360
days ago has submitted a new individual

1113
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,180
graft

1114
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,969
that's a profile of the Sdn IPSec work

1115
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:20,850
for a specific use case within the data

1116
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:23,430
center and this is not a working with

1117
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:26,040
draft and not in se for adoption right

1118
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:29,940
now I might do that after

1119
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:33,210
the Sdn IPSec draft goes through the is

1120
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:37,230
Jian well when it's real really done I

1121
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:38,610
might ask for a doctrine I haven't said

1122
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:41,309
the theater I'm still going to be

1123
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:43,410
talking about it with both the Sdn IPSec

1124
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:47,310
authors and perhaps other people who are

1125
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:50,599
interested in data center encryption so

1126
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,600
just wanted to mention it

1127
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,870
thank you

1128
01:10:55,410 --> 01:11:01,620
I do have a question for you you have a

1129
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:04,380
LFE architecture draft and then this one

1130
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:16,920
translated so what's your plan the other

1131
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:19,710
draft to be dropped so our Linda has a

1132
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:24,770
question so we have another document

1133
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:28,650
about amicably electrons architecture

1134
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:34,680
based on I to NSF probably you can click

1135
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:39,059
and so that one is for how to develop I

1136
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:42,930
to NSF on top of cloud the system such

1137
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:45,390
as an appellee Laplace architecture so I

1138
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:49,140
think at the bottom yeah young a second

1139
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:54,800
yet one so total are explaining how to

1140
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:57,060
implement I to NSF on top of the ETS I

1141
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:02,580
and I probably reference your

1142
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:06,980
architecture so we explain how to build

1143
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:10,500
build I turn I have a component how to

1144
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:14,129
link a torus a framework into an

1145
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:17,340
appropriate lab France model so if the

1146
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:21,240
working group think this is useful

1147
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:24,740
especially implementation and deployment

1148
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:27,840
I believe it is valuable so we targeted

1149
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:31,590
information or artificial working group

1150
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:35,150
if Okamura power have interested in it

1151
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:39,359
that is a year possible yeah yeah item

1152
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:41,848
yeah right now are so we need we

1153
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:44,280
didn't discover yeah okay thank you for

1154
01:12:41,849 --> 01:12:48,780
that clarification thank you thank you

1155
