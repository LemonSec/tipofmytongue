3
00:01:59,730 --> 00:03:34,680
I can get started here we can settle

4
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:37,970
down all right welcome everyone to cozy

5
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:44,070
our last session of the last day for

6
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:47,820
those of you paying attention let's see

7
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:50,130
so unless this is your first day here

8
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,540
I'm pretty sure you've seen the note

9
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,760
well but if not please please take note

10
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,010
of this it is important to especially

11
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,030
for the group working on things related

12
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,500
to cryptography IPR disclosures are very

13
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,799
important and very critical to us so

14
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,280
please please consult the the relevant

15
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,280
BCPs

16
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,769
so as part of our administrivia a

17
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:24,350
reminder that a minute taker do we have

18
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:27,160
anyone willing to volunteer for taking

19
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:31,070
minutes all we're really looking for are

20
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,660
action items and like broad conclusions

21
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,610
that the chairs will will call out to

22
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:40,820
you we don't need a blow-by-blow thank

23
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,360
you thank you Michael

24
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,060
in jabber skype we have Francesca taking

25
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,720
that so that will be anything that needs

26
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,699
to be relayed into the room if we can't

27
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,370
do it if for whatever reason media echo

28
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,530
isn't working or is it the inconvenient

29
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,990
we have the media Co links and the links

30
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,229
to all the materials all the slides that

31
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,880
we'll have today alright so here's our

32
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,430
agenda we've already gone through most

33
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,370
of our administration but we'll be

34
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,330
covering this drafts hash algorithms

35
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:20,120
x.509 from Jim's and then wrap up with

36
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:24,909
Mike Jones and web authentic to the time

37
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:33,070
we should be out of here pretty quick so

38
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:37,310
any any bashing of this agenda all right

39
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,849
so let's move on I think that's it for

40
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:47,720
our slides the one document we'll note

41
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:52,669
is the the hash signatures document has

42
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,880
is an ad evaluation the ad evaluating

43
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,889
and switched from Benjamin to Roman

44
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,949
thank you Roman so we should be able to

45
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:08,919
start advancing that here soon Jim

46
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:11,030
you're hiding okay

47
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,380
this actually probably won't take very

48
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:19,210
long at all you want to put me in full

49
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,210
screen no we were

50
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:32,869
there we go so first of all the document

51
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:38,480
that is on this way hopefully to be

52
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:41,120
coming the real standard this is the set

53
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,750
of open issues that I listed at the last

54
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,590
meeting I believe that they are all

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:53,000
finished so everything should be there

56
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,710
for the continent for the economical

57
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,890
encoding you know I just basically went

58
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,930
through and made sure everything was

59
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:03,020
cleanly said and actually ended up

60
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:09,340
removing the reference entirely in terms

61
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:13,700
of that particular piece we still

62
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,320
potentially have the down ref issue we

63
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,760
don't know how fast is the seaboard

64
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,050
based documents actually going to get

65
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:24,260
out it is not moving nearly as fast as

66
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:27,410
what this document is so we may still

67
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,840
end up having to argue with the IHG

68
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,820
about that particular down ref but I

69
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,099
don't think it should be a big issue as

70
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:42,080
we're doers doing the most basic

71
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:43,670
seaboard stuff in our up status one of

72
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,979
the things we have to do is convince the

73
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:49,280
IES chief that we actually do have

74
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,880
interrupts so far I have found eight

75
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,299
different implementations three of which

76
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:03,230
are mine all of which are actually up on

77
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:07,700
github interestingly enough almost

78
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:12,860
everybody does signing and almost nobody

79
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,479
does encryption I'm not really too sure

80
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,080
why that is true because when I wrote my

81
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,820
code I started with encryption it

82
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,750
probably has to do with what people

83
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,430
actually need in the real world and I

84
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,320
basically just went through in red code

85
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,620
in terms of trying to figure out what

86
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,529
people were doing so we may have this

87
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:37,999
may actually change as I find other

88
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:40,669
I'm at Justin Richards just a quick note

89
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:42,560
that parallels the hoes a world where I

90
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:46,040
just about everybody does Jam to the US

91
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,680
most people don't do jwe and even in the

92
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,990
classes that I teach on a often Jose

93
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,479
I teach jws and say if you want to do

94
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,249
JWA co-create or something

95
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,279
yeah go that's that's an exercise at

96
00:08:55,249 --> 00:09:00,980
home so this this is not at all

97
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,170
surprising to me because in the real

98
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:07,089
world that seems to be where most of the

99
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,089
use cases are dragon is signatures

100
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:14,809
question Jim if Mike or Tristan is a

101
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:16,309
sign one and sign generally are they

102
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:18,350
both implemented or is it mostly just

103
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:22,790
sign one almost every a might implement

104
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,970
stuff okay because they don't know which

105
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,248
one they're gonna want and once you had

106
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,559
once you've done the full sign sign one

107
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:32,839
kinda just falls out without thinking

108
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,949
about it a lot of people will only let

109
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:41,230
you sign with one person but they

110
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:41,229
actually have curves you will both I

111
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:47,839
think the point of my question actually

112
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:52,100
to that point is whether or not users

113
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,899
should be specific or protocol users

114
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,139
that is should be specific about we

115
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,939
accept sign one and only sign one or you

116
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,339
should accept the generality of both

117
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:03,529
structures which may only be signed by

118
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,610
one for one entity because there's a

119
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,319
little bit of subtlety in the

120
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,579
clarification code if it's that's there

121
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:09,229
if you don't eat it you don't have to

122
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:12,339
have it but the other hand of ending

123
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:16,879
what everyone's implementing it then

124
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:19,009
maybe protocol users should be a little

125
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:24,559
bit liberal of which one they they deal

126
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:30,379
with Michael Richards would be good for

127
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:33,170
you our notes I was wanting you dislike

128
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,509
says interrupts status and in you you

129
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,860
talk about reuse of information did you

130
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,740
do interrupted these different

131
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,439
interpretations of what what was done I

132
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,090
have not managed to actually get in Rob

133
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:46,189
status on Oliver

134
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,950
I've started and the first thing I

135
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,020
started with was which ones do I want to

136
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:58,940
play with because which was a the most

137
00:10:51,020 --> 00:11:01,819
complete which which implementations did

138
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,180
you did you investigate did you post up

139
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:11,810
somewhat because I'm curious on whatever

140
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:14,270
I have not posted it someplace some of

141
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,699
it is posted in the in the structured

142
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:21,470
document because there's a section that

143
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:23,750
talks about implementations and I need

144
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,610
to to get that post in someplace I'm

145
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,340
intending to put it up on the github

146
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:33,890
site but I haven't done so and no yours

147
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:36,170
is not one of them do you want the

148
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:42,860
chairs to set up a wiki or something to

149
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:44,240
Travis would it be appropriate what

150
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,810
phrase do another way would it be

151
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,370
appropriate to use the wiki either the

152
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,339
ITF wiki or the github wiki on the

153
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,080
project for doing this traffic I was

154
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,960
planning to use the wiki on the github

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:01,370
but I don't think it actually makes a

156
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:04,610
big difference in terms of interrupts

157
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:08,540
testing almost every implementation I've

158
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:13,580
seen actually pulls down the examples

159
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:16,310
from the example repository so half the

160
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,650
job of testing for interrupts is is

161
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,680
probably already done that is everybody

162
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:25,069
can already verify stuff that I signed

163
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,020
or stuff that I encrypted it's just a

164
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:33,950
question making sure that the other the

165
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:35,390
opposite direction works as well going

166
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,560
forward I think we're ready for Less

167
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:41,480
call I have no open issues on this I

168
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,319
don't know of anything that is

169
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,200
outstanding

170
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,810
that stop the document itself from

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,760
progressing it's just a question of

172
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:54,939
getting a sufficient amount of

173
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,939
interrupts for the iesg

174
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:09,040
questions all right

175
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,050
I mean speaking for myself met this

176
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,849
matthew Miller I mean I've read through

177
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,640
the structure and hallux document I know

178
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,560
we're talking about structure right now

179
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,590
and it seems fine to me I will submit to

180
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,969
you the editorial notes I have within a

181
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,970
few days okay

182
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,760
the algorithms wrapped this is basically

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,370
the other half of what the original

184
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:38,680
document was basically the things that I

185
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,130
said I was going to do in Prague I went

186
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,989
through and did and I think this

187
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,290
document should be ready to go to

188
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,900
working group last call there is one

189
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:53,199
interesting question which we may want

190
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,699
to consider and I think is a good thing

191
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,400
to consider during working with last

192
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,220
call which is do we want this document

193
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,670
on standards track or should it be an

194
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:12,790
informational document I'm agnostic

195
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:15,150
towards that does anyone want to venture

196
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,150
an opinion

197
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:26,860
Justin Richard since you can't really

198
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:29,170
use kuzey without having and the

199
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,780
specifics of an algorithm why would this

200
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,240
not be a standard track document well I

201
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,180
have zero intention of ever trying to

202
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,120
progress this to a full standard okay

203
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,099
but I mean most of what the IETF sits

204
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,660
out never goes a full standard anyway

205
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:52,900
because nobody cares yeah I have some

206
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:55,120
personal opinions about that I'm just

207
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,380
saying the perception from the outside

208
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,090
well one perception from the outside

209
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,830
world don't care if it's informational

210
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,780
standards tracker experimental it's just

211
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,140
a thing that exists and if it's got an

212
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,740
RFC

213
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,800
number it must be good

214
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,260
but from a from a more philosophical

215
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,979
perspective seeing that this is this is

216
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,050
fairly important and course stuff I

217
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,600
don't see a compelling argument for

218
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,910
being informational incidentally this

219
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,760
same argument is also why in the first

220
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,270
iteration of the cosy working group

221
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,100
which which I co-chaired that's why we

222
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,900
had it in a single document instead of

223
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,950
splitting it out because the two are

224
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,720
inextricably linked you can use the

225
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,670
structures with new algorithms yes but

226
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,660
you have to have an algorithm somehow

227
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,189
and so saying that the algorithms are

228
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,469
somehow less than standard just feels

229
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,030
really funny to me but I'm not here to

230
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,490
re-litigate the documents Frank I

231
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:54,560
understand that that's that bad decision

232
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:57,270
has already been made here fine but

233
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:06,869
that's kind of where I land on what this

234
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:09,630
ought to be been connected yeah I'm kind

235
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,130
of sympathetic to that just it but of

236
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,630
course you think that the set of

237
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,220
documents is good because you know we

238
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:22,530
change our rhythms more often than we

239
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:24,780
change bolts then I hate to ask you to

240
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,819
stay but do you have a do you have any

241
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,709
particular concerns about this being

242
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:36,150
informational versus standards track or

243
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:38,100
I mean so just in terms of process wise

244
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,780
it's a whole lot easier to start off

245
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,010
targets in this truck and then move it

246
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,750
to information than it is to go the

247
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,040
other way around you have to do all new

248
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:51,110
right last call etc so like that so my

249
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,110
my gut feeling it's too

250
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,820
I'll urge the night great I can't see

251
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,680
why you wouldn't it's just a label

252
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:08,900
although everything else happens the

253
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,429
same way and and is your is your it's

254
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,800
some of your reluctance that you believe

255
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,449
that by the time we get to step two that

256
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,339
the algorithms will have changed let's

257
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:19,360
start all over again or is your

258
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,849
reluctance bigger architectural IETF

259
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,010
thing well I mean I would never progress

260
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:28,099
this one up because if one of the

261
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,960
outcomes does go bad you have to

262
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:32,990
basically rerun the whole thing up to

263
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,550
full standard right yeah saying

264
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:40,040
everything every time the numbers change

265
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:42,139
it to redo it so so I have to look and

266
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,760
see what the IV set working groups are

267
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:48,080
recommendations with are should pluses

268
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,480
and minuses how that worked whether we

269
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,810
put informational or standard I never

270
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,850
thought about it okay to be honest you

271
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:59,030
could probably look it up in the thing

272
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:02,120
but under something you're probably not

273
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:04,610
familiar with that but but we extended

274
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,979
must and should and stop to have must

275
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,840
plus and must - and should plus and

276
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,850
should - and that basically means these

277
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,530
are algorithms which we're thinking

278
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,300
about deprecating if they have - as

279
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,440
they're going on the way down and if

280
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,730
they have pluses they're going on the

281
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,360
way out you should think about they're

282
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,520
becoming mandatory and and I think we've

283
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,129
read that about every approximately

284
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,170
every five or seven years I mean about

285
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,740
three grams of it now you know the

286
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:34,929
original one said triple des plus okay

287
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:37,910
must plus single des you know mate and

288
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:44,540
at this point it says triple des you

289
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:46,850
know made - single des must not and you

290
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:50,178
know he s various things you know with

291
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,340
various levels of mustard plus yeah you

292
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:54,920
see how that processes over overtime

293
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,510
yeah I mean we do exactly we did exactly

294
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,290
the same thing with the S minus

295
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,390
specifications and I've never thought

296
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:05,570
about trying to progress those about to

297
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:08,360
fall stands because we since they got

298
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,789
algorithm recommendations in them we Rev

299
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,208
them on a you know

300
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:16,039
every year basis but you know in the

301
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:18,229
last 20 years I think we're now on the

302
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:20,299
fifth or sixth version right so I think

303
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:22,129
that's just fun so yeah so put the

304
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:27,579
standards track it's not gonna get it's

305
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:27,579
not gonna get step two and that's okay

306
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:35,989
okay so I will be asking for working

307
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:37,820
group last call on this right so working

308
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:50,029
group last call for struck the end for

309
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:51,889
owls the algorithm in that is is to be

310
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:54,109
done or actually I'm not too sure if

311
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:59,748
it's about how we actually if Modi in a

312
00:19:54,109 --> 00:20:03,198
charter for new algorithms so far we've

313
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:09,109
had one only one person has actually

314
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:11,239
said I really want if this algorithm if

315
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:12,978
it's only one hey I can do that really I

316
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:16,399
can do that by Singapore in him we can

317
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:19,089
be been finished if other people really

318
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:26,779
want us to put in other algorithms I

319
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:30,319
really want to hear about it yeah let me

320
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:32,839
know otherwise we can basically say when

321
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,219
new algorithm documents are needed we'll

322
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:43,178
just go ahead and let them be AV

323
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:43,179
sponsored x.509 certificate document

324
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:53,329
basically everything that we talked

325
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:56,989
about at the last meeting most of it

326
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:58,849
basically is after I thought about it

327
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:03,019
for a while I don't think we need to do

328
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:06,499
it so I didn't write it into any of the

329
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:09,349
documents we have had one person asked

330
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:12,079
for an early assignment of the curb

331
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:13,158
points for this this because they're

332
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,069
actually going to start doing some

333
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,139
interrupts testing in about three weeks

334
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:20,239
and then if we actually have real

335
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:24,320
numbers that would prefer to use real

336
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:29,690
numbers than to use made-up numbers

337
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:32,450
that purpose I actually intended to push

338
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:36,559
examples for this up to the to the

339
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:39,889
repository and I ended up with problems

340
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:44,350
with open SSL in terms of trying to

341
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:47,508
generate certificates for things like x2

342
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:50,809
55.9 because of course you can't

343
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:53,720
actually create a CSR with it so they

344
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:56,120
have some funky language for command

345
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,009
switches which I haven't managed to

346
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,350
figure out how to get to work actually I

347
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:03,620
need to actually like synced up my

348
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:06,139
version of open SSL and rebuild it in

349
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:10,158
debug mode and try to figure out what

350
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:12,350
I'm doing wrong one of the big issues

351
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:17,570
that I talked about was defining a new

352
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:20,360
cozy key type I actually in my codebase

353
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,570
said no I'm just gonna have a parameter

354
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,840
which says how do you create it create a

355
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,789
cozy key from this public key and I've

356
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,199
found that to be sufficient so I don't

357
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:33,408
think we actually need to carry them

358
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,340
separately the places where we actually

359
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:43,789
may want to do this is in the ACE

360
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:45,620
working group in the pop draft there a

361
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:47,690
way there's a way to define a way to

362
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,699
carry things there and it would make

363
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,360
sense for us to be able to carry x.509

364
00:22:49,700 --> 00:23:06,080
certificates at that point

365
00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:07,908
question question yes I should be let's

366
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:19,129
say it should be a co-op content type

367
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:21,019
sorry yes well I'd like to have sure we

368
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:25,969
have at least a day idea of what I'd use

369
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:28,820
it for and there are content types

370
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,470
defined for just a bearer I mean it

371
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,779
would make sense potentially to define a

372
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:37,980
content type for bare x.509 certificate

373
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:42,210
but not for what not for one of you

374
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,650
not for a barrier certificates maybe but

375
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,830
we would wanted to find the content

376
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,870
types that match up to the current

377
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:52,580
contents that exist like that at one

378
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,580
point you were planning to do a drop at

379
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,870
this stage as a general principle of it

380
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:06,960
when you touch one of these things you

381
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,459
do a other form of registration because

382
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,720
you might even trenched

383
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,850
an issue reasons believe you don't yeah

384
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:22,500
I could certainly have that in that's

385
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:32,480
that's not that difficult to do any

386
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:35,640
other questions on this page so

387
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,380
obviously if I do the content stuff then

388
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,770
that's one revision before we do the

389
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,990
working a group last call but I would

390
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:46,668
still like to get the early adoption of

391
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:52,770
the code points for the cosy attributes

392
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:55,799
done so if there's no objections I'd

393
00:24:52,770 --> 00:25:01,320
like to just go to Hannah and tell them

394
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:03,559
to register of them since I'm one of the

395
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,549
expert reviewers on that registry I

396
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:10,649
think the back I'm not an expert

397
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:12,809
reviewer on that registry which means I

398
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,080
guess we should be a little bit more

399
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:19,049
formal not end books they have to talk

400
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:24,870
to the ad to find out exactly how fast

401
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:31,440
we can run now anything anybody any

402
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:34,770
other questions okay I will have a new

403
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,000
draft out within two weeks okay thank

404
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,460
you

405
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,940
at least regarding these four drafts

406
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,950
that we've just kind of blasted through

407
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,890
the chairs have talked about it and

408
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,309
we're we're we're leaning is whoa

409
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,630
if you work in group last call for the

410
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:54,410
biz drafts you

411
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:57,030
immediately either today or by Monday

412
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:00,330
and then the other ones mostly for our

413
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:02,580
own sanity than on the reviews hold

414
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:06,780
those off for one or two weeks so that

415
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:09,780
we can get ourselves a cadence I might

416
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,050
suggest that a four week process to be

417
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:15,060
due to vacation schedules may be

418
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,220
reasonable okay

419
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,379
well we'll do a if we can record that in

420
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,160
minutes or we'll look at a four week

421
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,710
working group last call or four weeks

422
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,660
scheduled for these so two weeks let

423
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,430
that finish the next two weeks is that

424
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,960
now I was actually thinking more weeks

425
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,060
got off now

426
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,930
if yeah I know people who will be on

427
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:39,200
vacation for the next week and a half

428
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,200
that's very

429
00:26:47,850 --> 00:27:05,580
all right Mike hmm and we'll talk about

430
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:08,389
the web offense will good afternoon and

431
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:19,730
thank you all for being here at this

432
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:19,730
last session okay there we go

433
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,410
so this specification as you may recall

434
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,310
the purpose of it is to register some

435
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:33,810
existing algorithms that are used by the

436
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:37,879
web application specification both in

437
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:40,409
the cozy algorithms registry and to make

438
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,080
corresponding registrations if they're

439
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:46,350
not already present in the Hosea

440
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:54,899
registry and the draft fulfills a

441
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:56,760
charter point this is not advancing so

442
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,540
what's happened since we last met our

443
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,570
heroes we had working group adoption of

444
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,980
an individual draft we changed the title

445
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:10,169
as requested by the working group

446
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:13,380
address review comments some of which

447
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:17,960
were substantive from John Matson Matt

448
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:21,600
Palmer and Jim shod and we did make

449
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:25,260
normative changes the primary change was

450
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,919
to change the Jose curve identifier from

451
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,879
P 256k which had been made up and was in

452
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,940
use by some early implementations to

453
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,430
sect P 256 K 1 and that was discussed on

454
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:43,320
the list I won't repeat the rationale

455
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:46,770
here we also specified that the signing

456
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,530
is done using sha 256 as the hash

457
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,950
function where previously we'd been

458
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:55,820
silent on the hash function which was an

459
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,820
unintentional omission

460
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:05,930
there have been no comments received

461
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:07,879
since those things were addressed this

462
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:12,970
is a very simple draft that but I

463
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:15,620
merrily has ia and I do some actions so

464
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,510
it's my sense that we're probably ready

465
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,969
for working group last call but I'll

466
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,480
obviously defer to the chairs of the

467
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,480
working group

468
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:30,530
well when the chairs convert conversed

469
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:33,050
earlier we were yes we were looking at

470
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,910
advances unless there's any strong

471
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:37,399
unless there's any objections here we'll

472
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:40,250
be in the similar cadence with the other

473
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:52,540
documents so this would follow the best

474
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:57,550
drafts on its on its cadence thank you I

475
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,550
was making adjustments in the minutes

476
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:10,520
one small point we actually right now

477
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:16,040
the registration on the the k1 algorithm

478
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:17,360
says IETF recommended we need to go

479
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,440
through some sort of procedure to make

480
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,959
sure that's correct

481
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:28,460
because I think in point if I answer it

482
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:30,920
right now is no I'm not positive and I'm

483
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,250
okay with that coming out differently

484
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,740
just put a comment on the list possibly

485
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:47,090
as part of the last call or you could do

486
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:49,520
it right now thank you thanks Jim all

487
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:53,120
right so with that so that's effectively

488
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:58,370
over all of our outstanding drafts and

489
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,959
our outstanding work so unless there's

490
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,729
anything else to talk about at this

491
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,800
point we've got a number of last calls

492
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:07,280
we'll be going through

493
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:10,240
we expect that we'll well - so amount of

494
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:17,230
turn on those probably very very mine

495
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:20,590

497

in into the is GQ before Singapore

498
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:33,189
unless there's anything else we think we

499
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,270
ought to be covering I think this can be

500
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:39,910
a wrap for the day

501
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:44,830
I see the adsr quite happy about hearing

502
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:51,160

507
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,000
seen a room not clear out as soon as

508
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,000
