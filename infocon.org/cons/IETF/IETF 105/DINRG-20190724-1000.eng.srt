1
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,930
how about a note-taker for the

2
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:22,168
so today is the ones in a lifetime

3
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:22,800
already it's really easy to do it's a

4
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:26,099
first step

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,320
yeah thank you

6
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,650
it's the first step on the pathway to

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,650
glory

8
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,490
tell me

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,619
hello and welcome to the decentralized

10
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:35,190
internet infrastructure research group

11
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:36,720
we are an IIT F activity and as such the

12
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,300
note well it might be a little bit

13
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,910
different from what you've seen in IETF

14
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:47,119
working groups we're under a similar but

15
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:50,280
not identical IPR regime a little

16
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,369
certain coordinates for finding us we've

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,929
got of course the mailing list URL is

18
00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,890
there and we've got a wiki as well so

19
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:04,860
today's agenda is going to be know well

20
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,990
which we just did minutes an attacker in

21
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,389
Java Skype will cut much gratitude to

22
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:14,670
the folks who volunteered blue sheets

23
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:18,319
and now we are gender bashing so we've

24
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,059
got three talks whoops that's bad

25
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,660
everything in my part we've actually

26
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,120
only got one talk from Lisa Jiang which

27
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,890
is decentralization from the ground up

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,069
on the other two talks are going to be

29
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,220
lat knee and O's on messed up and hands

30
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:40,679
on a block team-based test bed for PGP

31
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,620
verification once we're done we'll talk

32
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,099
a little bit about possible future and a

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,980
possible future interim and then we're

34
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,130
going to end a bit early and today I

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:59,089
will be leading a side meeting on his

36
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,090
topic so thank you any any Bastion

37
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:24,579
okay Leandro hi so I'm going to present

38
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,630
some work we've been doing in the last

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:31,060
year or so related to a like longer work

40
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:34,480
we've been doing with with a wireless

41
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,660
community networking in Barcelona this

42
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,910
is therefore about decentralized

43
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,600
networks which emerge because someone

44
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,450
needs connectivity and they they'd set

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,690
up an antenna they make connections with

46
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:53,380
neighbors and then all these routers

47
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:56,380
which are connected wirelessly they form

48
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,210
a mesh network and then not mention

49
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,340
network can provide coverage in a given

50
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,040
region in our case we are working with

51
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,100
one of group of the given at community

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,370
network which has about 60,000 members

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,430
in the Spain mainly in Catalonia and the

54
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,050
South of Catalonia in Valencia and in

55
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,358
Barcelona there is a community network

56
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,410
that where the university is part of

57
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,210
which has about hundred routers and then

58
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,240
of course in the edges we have like

59
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,969
access points where people connect to

60
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,860
the with end-user devices and on the

61
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,110
other side there are one or several

62
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,600
internet gateways which allow people to

63
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,970
reach the internet so the network is

64
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,030
decentralized everyone contributes a

65
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,280
note and then we use the term

66
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,979
crowdsourcing because it's not just

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,349
about setting the network but also about

68
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,900
contributing connectivity and about

69
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,240
investing in in the capacity of the

70
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,950
network and so on so we restored the

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,130
idea that we would like to have networks

72
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:04,419
which self-sustaining not only in terms

73
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:07,270
of traffic of data but also in the say

74
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:10,990
traffic of economic value so people can

75
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,169
can pay for the infrastructure and the

76
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,050
and the services that they provide

77
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:18,539
so as I said is about combining let's

78
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,210
say routing of data which is automated

79
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:24,748
it's reduce mesh networking routing

80
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,529
protocols and in a way to try to find if

81
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:30,719
that cam if the economic flow can be

82
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:36,029
also automated and make the net were

83
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:38,550
sustainable and self-supporting this is

84
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,189
nice in fact the idea in a mechanism

85
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,629
that and keifa net uses for they call it

86
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:46,229
economic compensation

87
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:48,900
so infrastructure shared and then the

88
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,688
payment is based on capex and OPEX and

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,229
is proportional to contribution and

90
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:57,120
consumption so so automation is

91
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,800
important because as we have seen in in

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,800
in in the in the larger community

93
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,659
network unless we automate things are

94
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,430
very difficult to manage dealing with

95
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:10,229
money is complicated fare accounting

96
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,389
because there are participants which are

97
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:17,729
very tiny in others but which are pretty

98
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:21,150
big finding the optimal fair charging is

99
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:25,080
is important and we have seen when

100
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:28,289
especially with money operations have to

101
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,139
be Amina you need to be accountable with

102
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:33,509
respect to your members also to the tax

103
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,389
office you need to have a proper

104
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:40,020
accounting and and if there is a

105
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,509
commitment the commitment has to be we

106
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,310
use the term inexorable so if we

107
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,360
committee but things have to happen us

108
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,789
as planned and well the important

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,029
concepts in in in this work is the idea

110
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:58,830
of automation first fairness of treat

111
00:06:54,029 --> 00:07:02,099
everyone correctly and regarding the

112
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:06,229
accounting that has to be we can use the

113
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:08,938
irreversible irrevocable unalterable

114
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,909
with respect to the past in with respect

115
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,460
to the future we we use the idea of as

116
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:16,560
my contracts to reflect that if there is

117
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,289
a commitment imagine like a service

118
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,599
agreement to connect to the internet or

119
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,560
an agreement to route traffic or

120
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,259
whatever

121
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,790
once is signed it has to be has to

122
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,760
happen sooner

123
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,850
so it's inevitable or inexorable because

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,490
he will work as suspected so in the

125
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,350
system we have like like this little you

126
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,600
could divide it into three layers once

127
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,070
part is a monitoring system where we

128
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,540
have a database of notes but that

129
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,490
participate in the network and we

130
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,410
collect measurements of our traffic in

131
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,020
the middle that is the let's say the

132
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,760
network chain from a user that connects

133
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,859
with the user device to an access point

134
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,659
then there are several routers in the

135
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,350
end somewhere there is a gateway to the

136
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,750
internet and all that network is let's

137
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,550
say supported by a group of servers

138
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,650
imagine like there are several

139
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,690
participants who can have want to have a

140
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:12,179
copy of the accounting to make sure that

141
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:15,000
things are really not correct and no one

142
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,710
is doing anything wrong you have a few

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,770
servers where the smart contracts and

144
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,599
the blockchain are stored and so we use

145
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,640
a private product chain a permission

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,940
blockchain in in the inside the network

147
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,460
and then the idea when the formulation

148
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:33,840
is a bit complicated but there it is

149
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,978
very simple I mean people get two access

150
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,930
points they find prices for like the

151
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:43,140
network access imagine like paying for

152
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:45,810
electricity you see how much is kilowatt

153
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,230
per hour at that moment and and the

154
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:52,229
price is collected from users that is a

155
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,560
smart contract that gives you rinoa

156
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,360
few gigabytes of traffic and then you

157
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,369
deposit an amount of money and if the

158
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:05,730
services is correct that amount is then

159
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:09,240
taken from the user and those payments

160
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:12,930
from end users go to we call it the

161
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,180
wholesale market where we collect data

162
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,030
about who contributed to deliver that

163
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,790
traffic to the clients and then the

164
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,170
amounts of money are split

165
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,150
proportionally to the effort done by the

166
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,339
routers and the gateways to the internet

167
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,740
because are the ones who similar to the

168
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,930
power generation there are different

169
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,160
sources of electricity that price per

170
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,040
kilowatt hour is a balance between

171
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,140
demand and offer and then there's a

172
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,069
mediator who

173
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:45,020
is a smart guy who computes the the

174
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:47,570
kilowatt hour price for the next time

175
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,930
depending on how much each router

176
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:54,230
charges or each gateway charges to move

177
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,079
through the network so we have a group

178
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:00,800
of nine contracts we have a the mesh

179
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,390
network the Dow and then on one side we

180
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,579
have on the right side we have an Oracle

181
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,290
which is the one that collects

182
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,610
monitoring information imagine like

183
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:12,740
enough in a trust of a way so that they

184
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,080
measure traffic in different points of

185
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,710
the network to avoid that people can

186
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,770
tamper with the traffic there is also a

187
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:24,680
local currency a local token which is

188
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:28,430
supported by an ELC 20 contract and then

189
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,500
on the site of consumption people can

190
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,989
instantiate select and instantiate one

191
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,800
is one of the smart contracts that grew

192
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,450
like access like what you would do if

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,709
you wanted to connect to a mobile

194
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,730
operator you would choose the one that

195
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:47,720
the volume per time whatever per quality

196
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,700
and on the right side routers they have

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,480
we have a smart contract that is an ELC

198
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:58,910
7:21 compatible which it is with the

199
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:01,430
let's say tokens that reflect ownership

200
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,939
of devices so you own a device you have

201
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,800
fun like a token on fungible token that

202
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,170
reflects that you own that device and

203
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,339
then of course when that device works

204
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,770
and thus for wedding it gets paid so we

205
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:19,460
pay the router the router gives the

206
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:22,130
money to the owner so this is the list

207
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,450
of contracts and ingredients so

208
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:28,370
basically yeah we need them fungible

209
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,590
token to pay between the different

210
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,740
between all participants in the network

211
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,750
we have a non front super token that

212
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,120
allows to manage ownership of the

213
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,330
devices in the network we need this

214
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,400
Oracle which allows to connect the

215
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,010
economic and the technical words to make

216
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,730
sure that traffic is properly accounted

217
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,500
and well and

218
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,560
and the concerns that is mentioned about

219
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,279
three roles in the system this is

220
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,040
implemented using the gas theory of

221
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,709
software but configured to work in the

222
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,589
inner proof of authority mode that means

223
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:08,800
we have a I mean an intranet let's say

224
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:11,529
where we use our knowns around service

225
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,560
and but then that allows us to write the

226
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,790
smart contracts in solidity and

227
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,660
environments quite stepa so I mean we

228
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:22,630
also tried hydrology lubricant so it

229
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:25,510
took this because simply it works and

230
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,100
then of course in the network our

231
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,870
network is already there but in a

232
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,670
imagine someone wants to set up a

233
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,209
network in a different location they

234
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:38,290
would bootstrap a network by adding at

235
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:40,510
least one server then the network can

236
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,099
grow by minting we call it meeting at

237
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,160
devices registering devices in the

238
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,630
inductor local blockchain sooner or

239
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,430
later

240
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,079
internet that way will appear it is

241
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,120
necessary to get to the Internet

242
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,620
sooner or later an access point will

243
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,279
appear which isn't it required to

244
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:00,730
connect end users with a mesh network

245
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,920
then people can select a contract and

246
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,130
start a connection and then the system

247
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:10,449
periodically would compensate everyone

248
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:12,310
so owners of devices would be paid for

249
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:16,120
the effort that divides us and

250
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:19,540
eventually over time that owner would be

251
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,790
compensated and return would see its

252
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,949
investment returned and maybe with some

253
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,170
profit if necessary although in our

254
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:29,649
network social profit is more important

255
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,649
than economic this is a kind of block of

256
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,690
activity in the in the prototype they

257
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,209
see that well in the service you see

258
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:40,959
load when there is bootstrap when we add

259
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:43,029
as a node when we establish a contract

260
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,518
and when the conversation is run but we

261
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:48,790
don't do it every second we do it

262
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,000
periodically could even be everyday not

263
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,219
necessarily to make it too fast and then

264
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,550
this is a pic of a picture that shows

265
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,490
how money flows you can see that clients

266
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:03,310
have less and less money that red

267
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,170
line in exchange of the blue line which

268
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,550
means that the client is getting more

269
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,860
and more traffic so you pay for the

270
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,209
traffic you get and then of course the

271
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,490
routers which are involved in the

272
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,529
Gateway gets money out of that and

273
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,070
because there is some unbalanced like in

274
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:20,170
the electric system sometimes the every

275
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,089
period the prices are not properly fixed

276
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,550
so there's a there's a reserve account

277
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:27,100
where we save money to compensate every

278
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,660
in April cycle whatever small

279
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:35,260
differences between prices and and costs

280
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,089
so we we experimented the beaut we learn

281
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,370
about a bit from the implementation and

282
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,560
we started to prepare a pilot with the

283
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,649
local network and see how they perceive

284
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:48,279
the system because we want later on a

285
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:52,779
scale it up to a wider to the wider with

286
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,430
giving that network and but I think it's

287
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:55,959
not worth to enter into details if you

288
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,170
are interested in any aspect that we

289
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:01,989
like I comment but basically is I think

290
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:04,630
we achieve the aim of automated from

291
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:08,020
combining routing that we've worked on

292
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,880
the topic for a few years with also

293
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,760
routing of economic flows to make

294
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,209
networks self-sustaining economically

295
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:18,220
and and with the community we have

296
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:19,810
discussed that well if you invest in a

297
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,850
router you would like to see your

298
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,609
investment return I don't know so three

299
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,790
years four years we need to make sure

300
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,170
that that happens it's not the same to

301
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,790
be constantly entered like in an

302
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,439
internet exchange for a community

303
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:36,670
network or be profit oriented in which

304
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:39,520
people can optimistically deploy routers

305
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,349
to to get a profit how the profit

306
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,829
relates to quality of service coverage

307
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,900
whatever how what happens when people

308
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:50,650
charge differently for doing the same

309
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,240
job how to deal with clients who want to

310
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,890
pay more because we want to have all the

311
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,240
conference which is requires better

312
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:59,709
connectivity ventures downloading files

313
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,940
we are setting up a couple of pilots one

314
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,959
in South Africa and other one in

315
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,730
Barcelona

316
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:06,279
let's see how different cultures

317
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,730
perceive the idea of using tokens and if

318
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:12,660
how much we need to hide that to make it

319
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,670
usable also

320
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,189
the connection between our tokens we

321
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,240
have a local currency nowadays and we

322
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,879
are discussing with some other

323
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,089
initiatives on neighbourhoods to see if

324
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,470
these currency units can be used for as

325
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:30,569
a local currency beyond the network and

326
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,870
and well and there are several aspects

327
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:36,599
of identity and an enmity authorization

328
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:41,879
the stability of everything so but it's

329
00:16:36,600 --> 00:17:02,759
still work underway so that's my my

330
00:16:41,879 --> 00:17:08,579
presentation thank you antique and white

331
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:11,130
in it but so the idea of the blockchain

332
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:14,220
is because in these networks there are

333
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,980
different owners so the if if you deal

334
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,020
with money you have to make sure that no

335
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,530
one feels that someone is playing with

336
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,209
the numbers so inside the network if you

337
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,129
add a server because you want to know

338
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,900
what's going on you could receive a feed

339
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,059
of what's wrong what's happening in the

340
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,220
network so you can see what everything

341
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,860
that is going on there you will also be

342
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,289
running your an instance of the smart

343
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,600
contracts so everyone has access to

344
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:42,179
everything as we used to do in the

345
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,459
monitor network monitoring their

346
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,080
economic monitoring is the same you see

347
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,600
everything you contribute to the

348
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,699
computation of values and the consensus

349
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:56,490
I don't know if this is an answer to you

350
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:58,049
anyone can read yeah then what because

351
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,610
it seems that most of the work is done

352
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:05,429
by the auction itself once you get all

353
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:08,399
the data in the blemish and I mean you

354
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:11,820
could also as well zero work as well

355
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,130
publish it anywhere but I mean I'm not

356
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,250
sure what is added the value of the

357
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,710
function yeah the other values because

358
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:23,580
nowadays for instance the dimension

359
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,170
network publishes monitoring data among

360
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:29,240
the members and also part of it also

361
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:33,090
publicly filtering private information

362
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,120
but when it comes to paying for

363
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,490
maintenance for new nose and everything

364
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,280
they use a bank account they transfer

365
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,620
money periodically and it's a kind of

366
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,840
mobile overhead someone has to centrally

367
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,429
manage the accounting someone has to

368
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,500
make sure that everyone pays at the

369
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:53,520
right time and everything the idea was

370
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:58,680
to automate that process and then use

371
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,660
the this ERC 20 token to to have a local

372
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,570
currency and automate the operations so

373
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,690
the operations are I mean done

374
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:10,230
automatically without anyone intervening

375
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:13,110
and then in the end you you can see your

376
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:16,080
wallet and and see if you how much you

377
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:20,219
paid how much you got as a provider and

378
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,169
if since we use the smart contracts we

379
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,810
can also write down the rules of the

380
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,130
contract and then and then if if I for

381
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:30,240
instance connect to the network and I

382
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:32,630
pay for a jigger Python I mean when when

383
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,640
I get that chica bite if the quality is

384
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,010
above a minimum automatically I know

385
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,290
that my money will leave my wallet and

386
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,770
the provider will know for sure that

387
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,720
since there is an instance with a with

388
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,660
with a deposit of money for that

389
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,880
particular contract that he will be paid

390
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,950
for for that effort that he does by

391
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,590
forwarding the traffic so it's it's all

392
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:03,780
automating the the manual process of of

393
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:11,209
managing money we can discuss offline if

394
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:11,210
if you want Jonathan will use cloud plan

395
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:16,379
does the blockchain therefore contain

396
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,750
information about who is sending

397
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:24,300
information where and does not therefore

398
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:26,220
have privacy implications yeah well the

399
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:31,010
network monitoring system which is not

400
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:35,850
in the blockchain already aggregates

401
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:37,320
traffic information about the traffic we

402
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:41,120
have like we are

403
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:45,928
great volumes of traffic across routers

404
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:49,229
of course we don't do more than that and

405
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,659
then for the for the blockchain in the

406
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,269
blockchain there is information about

407
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:57,059
the identifiers of the participants in

408
00:20:54,269 --> 00:21:01,289
the network and how much they consume

409
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:03,690
produced and everything and and and yeah

410
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,970
one of the I did but this is cat let's

411
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,309
say privately between the members of the

412
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,110
mesh and one of the things we are

413
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,049
discussing is that there is a related

414
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:17,668
project in in in the group and also with

415
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:20,519
some friends that use mechanisms to to

416
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,679
to increase the privacy to make sure

417
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,690
that these transactions are anonymous

418
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,600
Matisse's Connect is a connection with

419
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,840
another project but yeah I mean

420
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,519
definitely privacy is is is an issue but

421
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,289
not in this kind of networks because

422
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,740
here generally people is completely

423
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:40,169
transparent about money flows because

424
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,570
compensation is based on declaring how

425
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:45,000
much you contributed how much you

426
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,399
consumed and then balancing things so

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,019
you need to know who are these related

428
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:57,449
to know the identifier of the

429
00:21:49,019 --> 00:22:03,409
participants thank you any other

430
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:03,409
questions thank you thank you very much

431
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:24,720
Jonathan's been helping out thank you

432
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:27,779
for that hello everyone

433
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,960
Chen Yin from hobby this is a work form

434
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:33,929
hobby telefónica colored university to

435
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,330
not have fun and see unique it's named a

436
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:40,740
blockchain based a testbed for the PGP

437
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:42,960
verification so it's about our research

438
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,960
project named decentralized Internet

439
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,299
infrastructure project last year my

440
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,759
colleague Peng Lu has published

441
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:55,299
were named decentralized Internet

442
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:59,080
resource trust infrastructure in 102

443
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:03,519
also in Banco and this is the update

444
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:08,379
above a research so this is an overview

445
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:12,190
of our DRI DRI system so in the bottom

446
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:14,259
is the distributed ledger layer is it is

447
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,749
the basic of the decentralized network

448
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:18,879
infrastructure and it's in charge of

449
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:22,779
provide decentralized system structure

450
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:26,559
and distributed consensus MEC didn't and

451
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:30,009
smart contracts capabilities so in each

452
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,350
node there is two key functions in in

453
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:35,289
the note 1 is the ledger who is

454
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:38,590
responsible for the storage and and then

455
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:42,879
other the other party of their smart

456
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:45,629
contract who functions and in the middle

457
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:49,059
we have the namespace management layer

458
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:52,119
which will storage their ownership and

459
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:54,999
mapping these two features such as we

460
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:58,480
can storage the ownership of IP address

461
00:23:54,999 --> 00:24:01,179
of the IAS number of the name of the

462
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:06,100
macro tag and also after the ownership

463
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:08,519
has been determined we can storage the

464
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,709
mapping relationship between these

465
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,649
network resources such as if we combine

466
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:17,320
the IP address with the s number it will

467
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:19,359
produce the BGP problems and then if we

468
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,109
combine the IP address and with the name

469
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:24,730
it will be that is DNS system

470
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:27,059
architecture and also if we combine the

471
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:30,549
IP address with the identity of

472
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:34,480
lightweight devices of IOT it can

473
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:37,509
describe the IOT structures so in our so

474
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,779
in this work we mainly focus on the the

475
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:46,059
part of the rice frame which is called

476
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:55,779
bgp verification oh I must be a clarify

477
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:58,299
that here the word is it it's a word

478
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:00,190
application layer is different from the

479
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:02,440
other traditional application layer

480
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,769
however traditional African there should

481
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,619
be in the top of this system okay so

482
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:11,590
what we focus on to solve the these

483
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:15,968
three bgp issues the first one is orange

484
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:18,580
in hijack that means that it is attack

485
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:22,210
traffic by publishing the prefix that

486
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:25,059
are not their own so the second one is

487
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,070
the pass hijack that's means the hijack

488
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:30,339
traffic by publishing false pass

489
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:33,580
information so here's an example such as

490
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:38,529
the free team will received path

491
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:41,439
information from AF 666 and then AF 66

492
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:44,679
said that I have a root or I'm the

493
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,649
neighbor of a s1 so the victim will fall

494
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,779
as if traffic directly to the a.s 66

495
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:53,080
because the new route is shorter than

496
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:55,269
the traditional pass three two one

497
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,718
so this is the project and the third one

498
00:25:55,269 --> 00:26:00,519
is we want to solve the leak problems

499
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:02,499
here's a classic example here that

500
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,460
Google was also the epic team not

501
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:07,210
looting leak

502
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,149
so the peer-to-peer route who was leaked

503
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,729
by the by their customer and truly

504
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:15,939
published and then the traffic was gone

505
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:19,179
wrong so why not are PKR pika is really

506
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:23,109
a good good method to solve a lot of

507
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:26,200
security or trustworthy problems but the

508
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:29,139
erica is centralized trust model so what

509
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,960
we want to do here is to build up a

510
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:34,299
decentralized trust trust model trust

511
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,450
architecture here so the centralized

512
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:41,039
trans model once the other authority

513
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:43,629
node in the high layer is miss can feed

514
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:47,979
intentionally or unintentionally the

515
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:49,928
older low layer node will not avoid the

516
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:53,769
influence of their mystic

517
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:56,799
so there's some research about the real

518
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:58,779
case that even though we deployed our

519
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,570
key care system in the real network we

520
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:06,700
will also cost

521
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:09,789
routing or other signal problems so this

522
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,700
is the overview of our test that we use

523
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:16,889
have larger fabric to build up the whole

524
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:19,269
system it is a can famous consultants

525
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:22,330
blockchain and also we can implement

526
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:24,609
this system by public blockchain or

527
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,009
private proteins that's okay we think

528
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:30,899
that the consortium blockchain is

529
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:34,450
similar with the current network

530
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:37,658
structures so on the chain we have the

531
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,539
consensus consensus system we have the

532
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:44,169
chain admission system and others are

533
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:46,899
the AIS as one two three four and in

534
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:50,019
each a s there is at least once public

535
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,279
note who maintains the IP address a s

536
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:54,460
number or a neighbor

537
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:58,570
information also the the transaction and

538
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:02,879
why are the article RTR interface the

539
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:05,168
fabric note will sent the RIAA

540
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:08,799
information through this interface and

541
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:12,190
then to do the synchronization so in

542
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,179
each fabric note we will install the

543
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:18,340
ownership ROA and neighbor whose

544
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:23,169
neighbor information such as here we

545
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:25,720
store the IP ownership who will own the

546
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:28,509
IP prefix and the expiry date and also

547
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,840
there is a column I are on it should be

548
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:36,519
the max length of the prefix another one

549
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,639
is the a s ownership and who is the

550
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,729
owner of the a s number and also the

551
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:45,699
external time and now and then there

552
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:49,029
will be the roa information that means

553
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,639
the mapping between the IP prefix and a

554
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:55,059
s number and then the last one is the

555
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:58,238
neighborhood of the neighbor information

556
00:28:55,059 --> 00:29:00,309
of between the a s so from the re we can

557
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:02,830
do the prefix orange in verification

558
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:05,470
from the neighbor information we can do

559
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:10,779
the root password validation and root

560
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:14,040
leak detection so firstly how to do the

561
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:17,190
origin verification so the IP address

562
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,379
initiate an RA actually is IP to a s

563
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,860
number mapping as a transaction and then

564
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,780
the smart contracts verify the address

565
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,809
ownership and ride our way into the

566
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,639
legend and then the relying parties get

567
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,830
a blog or a from the ledger and

568
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,080
synchronize to the beach periodic and

569
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,799
then they can verify that here's an

570
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,970
example such as the ISP he said i

571
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:47,970
authorized a a three the number a f3 to

572
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:52,740
arraign tonight this prefix 2001 da 832

573
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:55,380
and then he a broadcast or multicast or

574
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,540
mati single-car whatever to other or

575
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,360
other knows another knows we receive

576
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:04,549
this and verify whether p is the

577
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,678
ownership is the owner of the of these

578
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:09,780
prefix and then right right the right

579
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,010
there are a information to the local

580
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:16,230
later and local later the ra will be

581
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,480
synchronized to the relying party and

582
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:21,240
then to the water and their this AS

583
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,480
fought for the PDP update fortification

584
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,750
so this is the first step and then we

585
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,910
can do the a s possible vacation each s

586
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,980
published its neighbor information to

587
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,960
the later and the neighbor information

588
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,510
will be used for the a s pass

589
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,000
versification in PT p announcement and

590
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,320
then the relying party cat neighbor

591
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,790
information from the later and

592
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,020
synchronize the information to the

593
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:50,159
rogers so example here is PB published

594
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:53,790
its neighborhoods with i is 3 a by

595
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,330
broadcast or multicast and then other

596
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:59,940
knows will listen this information such

597
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:03,210
as d will listen to the information and

598
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:06,210
wait for the confirm and I received this

599
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:09,690
can receive did the this information

600
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,790
ends and to verify whether B is his

601
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,980
neighborhoods and then he confirmed and

602
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:17,700
the broadcast to other other nodes that

603
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:22,020
I confirmed a my neighborhood is is PB

604
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:24,840
and after this is PT will receive both

605
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,639
of these two information

606
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,939
and we'll verify the transaction and

607
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,309
record information in its local nature

608
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,620
and then the design part is synchronized

609
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:38,610
the neighbor relationship information to

610
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,580
all the voters in this yes so finally

611
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:46,908
there will be a s neighbor who's least

612
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:50,158
in each fabric note a star in the laser

613
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:53,970
this is the as is used to the heirs

614
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:59,369
possible vacation and then to how to

615
00:31:53,970 --> 00:32:01,110
verify the leak protection so ETS will

616
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:03,990
register their business relationship

617
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:06,769
with their neighbor into the later and

618
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:10,889
the business relationship will be

619
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:14,549
mistake will be a satisfied certified by

620
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:17,699
the payer of a s so here's a let's see

621
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:20,990
the example directly so SP be published

622
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:25,980
is bitterness relationship with is PA as

623
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:28,340
provider to customer and other nodes

624
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:32,100
such as C and D we'll listen to this

625
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:36,990
information and then is PA confirmed

626
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:40,860
that it confirmed that yes I am is VP

627
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:43,559
our relationship this with the

628
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,949
relationship this customer to provider

629
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:48,509
so D can verify the transaction and

630
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:53,340
record this information in the ledger

631
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:56,639
that means s 1 and s 2 the business

632
00:32:53,340 --> 00:33:00,840
relationship is provider to customer and

633
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:04,019
then after that all the ASBO announced

634
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,249
their business relationship and to build

635
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:09,840
out such relationship released and the

636
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:11,490
religion party will synchronize the

637
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,709
billionaire internship information to

638
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:21,149
the lodger in the local area for the

639
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:27,690
leak detection so so such as the I

640
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:31,350
speedy receive a route to a is D to C to

641
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,690
D to a yes D to B to C to D to C to B to

642
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:38,959
a

643
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:42,679
the rotor in SPD can verified by perhaps

644
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,950
such as okay D to see the relationship

645
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:50,210
is P to see or P to P or C 2 P whatever

646
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:55,309
and since it check how perhaps they will

647
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:57,950
check B to a maybe a peer-to-peer maybe

648
00:33:55,309 --> 00:34:01,249
a peer-to-peer relationship so they will

649
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:04,909
judge Oh this route is leaked by

650
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:06,399
somebody so they will finish the route

651
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,889
leak protection

652
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:13,429
so this is our overview of our test but

653
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:18,440
the main goal is to verify the DRI based

654
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:22,220
bgp verification we can get a very good

655
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,530
stable PGP environment Internet

656
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:27,969
so the testbed is based on the headlight

657
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:32,690
fabric our initial participants

658
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:35,839
including China Mobile China Telecom

659
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:38,929
Telefonica Xinhua universe debut PT

660
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,319
colors University of Madrid and ourself

661
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:46,940
we will expect we will enlarge this team

662
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:50,418
in the future and state 1 1 so state 1

663
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:54,279
we will set up two ISPs directly

664
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:58,730
connections we will simulate multiple

665
00:34:54,279 --> 00:35:01,520
fabric note in each IP area and then to

666
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:04,880
build out point-to-point verification

667
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,730
functions and then after that we enlarge

668
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,609
our team to the cross layer

669
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:15,260
cross area such as we can build up a lot

670
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:19,400
a team to to do the global BGP

671
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:21,619
verification this is our two states plan

672
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,660
so you're welcome to join our project

673
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:40,970
please don't contact me feel free

674
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:43,578
thank you putting that off ledger and

675
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,419
creating like the Merkle tree and just

676
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:47,849
putting the head of the tree

677
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,980
which you don't want to populate the

678
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,559
transaction blocks with the neighbor

679
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,940
ocean formulation it's gonna grow

680
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:57,029
because the neighborhood configuration

681
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:03,269
changes over time there's one comment

682
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:06,000
second comment I think you know the keys

683
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:08,970
to sign the business relationships is

684
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,039
one is that the same keys used to sign

685
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:16,799
the entries transactions on the exactly

686
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:19,230
yeah exactly so the verification

687
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:21,869
actually to verify whether you are the

688
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,730
legal identity you you have the legal

689
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:27,029
identity to do that actually

690
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,740
yes sir so the registry on the business

691
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:32,160
relationship registry would be done

692
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:35,899
something like you and I I sign it and

693
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,129
you can resign yeah thank you thank you

694
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,349
Jeff you shouldn't could you go back a

695
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:48,089
few slides to some of your primitives so

696
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:50,130
backwards please Oh which slightly stop

697
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:53,250
next month that's not okay so and when

698
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:56,789
we see here behind those two things

699
00:36:53,250 --> 00:37:01,170
called IP ownership and ASM ownership

700
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:03,690
hmm for assumably what you call an ISP

701
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:06,990
one is the holder of some public/private

702
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:10,650
key pair in the blockchain yeah why do

703
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:14,149
you own one dot one dot 0/24 and why

704
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:18,900
can't I say I am how do you uniquely

705
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:22,079
determine who has the authority to make

706
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,779
that claim into the ledger and how our

707
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:29,069
conflicting claims resolved same thing

708
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:31,440
applies to ASM ownership my the reason

709
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:33,259
why these questions are critical is that

710
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,859
every other part of what you're saying

711
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:40,250
is a mix of sob GP and SP GP and has

712
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:42,328
about 20 years of history now so

713
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,420
literally nothing about any of the rest

714
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:47,880
of this is not it's not it's the same

715
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,759
old stuff we've always had and every

716
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,599
time we've come to this part of the

717
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:57,540
problem is the initial injection of

718
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:01,710
unique authority to assert

719
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,540
control over an ASN or IP so I have the

720
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,690
same question here is we've had all the

721
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,360
time in all the other mergers and how do

722
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:13,310
you determine that that assertive

723
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:17,070
relationship in the ledger is real is

724
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:19,529
unique is authentic and how do you stop

725
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:24,900
anyone else from making a conflicting

726
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:27,060
plain hmm that's which okay thank you

727
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:33,780
very continuous Lee our focus our

728
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:36,930
projects so in my salt this is some some

729
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:40,470
of the a chicken-egg problems such as we

730
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:44,870
start from Rio we start to our project

731
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:49,129
we start our orange in the original

732
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:53,220
information insurance in our system so

733
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:56,520
we have three potential Meza to solve

734
00:38:53,220 --> 00:39:03,830
your your question the first one is we

735
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,830
use an absolutely new IP assignment

736
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:13,200
assignment scheme that used hopefully

737
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:21,780
use the smart contract to assign the IP

738
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:25,020
address so we can solve the setup with

739
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,810
both allocating 1.1 1.1 mm how does this

740
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:31,890
get resolved ah because the chance

741
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:36,570
system has consensus consensus scheme

742
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:39,029
here then you have the order of each try

743
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:47,340
sections the first one will be accept

744
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:49,530
and later will be objects yes an

745
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,800
interesting statement I'm glad you made

746
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,780
it

747
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,780
my eyebrows are bouncing off the ceiling

748
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,810
my eyebrows are still advancing

749
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:21,740
and also yeah thank you for your support

750
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:24,410
and also the overall system will check

751
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:28,299
whether you have the legal identity or

752
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,299
legal right to do that

753
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:39,799
maybe we can maybe we can exchange some

754
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,400
background of the of the blockchain

755
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,190
system that we have the relative scheme

756
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,920
and knowledge to hold on it to hold this

757
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:52,310
form to host this problem or others and

758
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,530
otherwise we have maybe we have second a

759
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:58,730
solution for that such as we use the

760
00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:02,630
current IP and DNS assignment rules and

761
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:06,170
then miniature the information from the

762
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:09,110
current network use the stability of the

763
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:13,040
such as the PDP environment and then we

764
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:15,980
can construct our origin information

765
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,810
storage so this is maybe the second

766
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:24,530
potential solutions for that

767
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:27,320
the third one is we can exchange this as

768
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:30,410
potential sellers later ok please so a

769
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,540
few cities yeah assuming that somebody

770
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,180
else has solved the really hard problems

771
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:37,130
which are the heart of this issue we

772
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,859
propose the following theme that assumes

773
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,390
a solution anyway and I'm struggling to

774
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,820
understand the novelty at that

775
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,830
particular point in time because the

776
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,470
really difficult issues in a distributed

777
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:50,150
system and alleges such as what we have

778
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,589
and what you're proposing the really

779
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,330
fundamental issues are where you're

780
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,850
dispensing going I just assume that

781
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,700
works and I think that's the heart of

782
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:02,210
why this is so difficult to understand

783
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,890
as be a self-contained and adequate

784
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,050
measure that would give us the assurance

785
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:09,319
we need in the numbering and routing

786
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,570
system so only seriously doubting the

787
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,380
viability of this until you provide

788
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,809
those kinds of

789
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,369
for what it's worth we've been seeing

790
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:20,900
exactly exactly the same problem in

791
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:24,410
decentralized namespace allocation and

792
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,329
and so on and this is this is large

793
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,420
class of unsolved governance problems

794
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:35,000
that are not really technical site

795
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:38,269
finesse because about them they're not

796
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,319
viable absolutely and with lots of

797
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:46,700
things are possible

798
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:48,200
so rather than that's the way the

799
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,799
research should be which is we're up

800
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,419
gently yeah I absolutely agree for

801
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:55,640
whatever amazing research tends to be

802
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,980
from the ground up rather than you know

803
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,980
the governance issues from the outset

804
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:10,609
because I mean the biggest problem is

805
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:12,289
attributing IP on a centipede also

806
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:15,650
everything else is just technical

807
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:17,869
details so but I have one technical

808
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:20,029
detail I want to ask about you said on

809
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:23,720
one slide that the people published in

810
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:24,380
the abduction some networks it already

811
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,750
exists

812
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,660
it's called Internet ultimately systems

813
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:36,140
we all know that it's far from perfect

814
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:44,629
so how do using an ignorant reversal one

815
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:46,819
page here okay each s we're describing

816
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,039
is a business relationship of it's

817
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:53,058
already possible it has been possible

818
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:56,509
very long time you publish TSL or

819
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:58,849
anything on we observe that people don't

820
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:01,849
do it properly that's one of the biggest

821
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:04,400
problem is BGP sexuality so then don't

822
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:09,890
do it properly for many many reasons one

823
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,900
of them being that business anyway how

824
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,598
do you solve this problem I mean what

825
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:17,180
makes you think that people will put in

826
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,279
the blockchain what the don't put into

827
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,230
this internet routing wedges

828
00:44:19,279 --> 00:44:25,400
yes one wonder what

829
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:28,910
the one player want to want to draw in

830
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,550
the games they do you evaluate what they

831
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:35,240
will input what you output what benefit

832
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:38,900
they can get from the system so someone

833
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:41,450
if they do not want to input some

834
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,670
information into the laser into the

835
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,439
decentralized system that they cannot

836
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,900
get a benefit that's okay

837
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,190
no problem but even though you want to

838
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:54,170
are once you want to input some business

839
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,780
relationship into this system you can

840
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:59,840
get a related benefit from this system

841
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:02,840
so forest that's your choice what we we

842
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:06,590
do here is to explore try to explore a

843
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:10,010
new scheme to solve the BGG verification

844
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:13,730
relative gratification problems we we

845
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:16,640
want to provide a new ideas new solve

846
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:26,780
new way to comparing RISD current

847
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:29,629
solutions yes thank you so kind of

848
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:32,330
agreeing and disagreeing with this I

849
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:36,170
think there was a kernel of truth here

850
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:38,480
and a lot of unnecessary plot so the

851
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:42,470
answer to the question that was asked by

852
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,140
the person you know well the last two

853
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:46,879
the answer to that question is who is

854
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,220
the source of authority the last two

855
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,619
people at the mics the Knicks are the

856
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:54,759
source of authority you cannot be

857
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:57,290
centralized a registry based system

858
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,200
unless there's a political decision that

859
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:02,450
we're going to decentralize it and the

860
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,000
political decision is that they want to

861
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:06,830
absolutely maintain control and that

862
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,430
comes all the way down from ICANN and I

863
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:12,799
sock on whatever and so what you will

864
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,660
need to run it is that those two

865
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,310
gentlemen would have to decide to run

866
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:21,170
the the chain and once you decide that

867
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:25,160
you don't want any of the blockchain

868
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:28,960
stuff kidney go in the garbage can yeah

869
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:31,819
a smart contract that they're not needed

870
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,970
what you want here is simply something

871
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:38,960
that looks like trans just a lot

872
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:43,669
and the kernel of truth here is that we

873
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:47,450
built the PKI for doing IP address

874
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:50,180
allocation based it on x.509 which was

875
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,339
the wrong technology basis what should

876
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,100
have happened was that the NIC should

877
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:58,270
have simply provided a harvest on that

878
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:02,660
attack log with a Merkle tree and

879
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:04,610
assigned it every few hours and what

880
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,670
every one of the allocations that they

881
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:11,240
have made into that chain and then

882
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:13,760
anybody could pull a net a station from

883
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,339
that single source of authority and get

884
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,240
approved for any allocation and that

885
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:22,190
would be a much more compact and

886
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:25,089
sensible approach than the one that was

887
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:28,130
foisted upon us because the NSA likes

888
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:31,610
x.509 so that's the kernel of truth here

889
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:34,490
but it's not D centralizing anything it

890
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:37,490
is in fact centralizing the existing

891
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:40,430
system even more just moving a more

892
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:43,640
appropriate technology and Bitcoin is

893
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:46,370
based on that technology but it is not

894
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,650
that technology and anything that

895
00:47:46,370 --> 00:48:01,609
involves smart contracts is not

896
00:47:48,650 --> 00:48:04,670
appropriate for this problem sorry what

897
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:09,730
kind of consensus algorithm your name

898
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:12,560
please and what kind of data causes

899
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:18,850
consistency have you achieved in your

900
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:22,299
test that consists actually in this part

901
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:27,830
as I said this work is only a part of

902
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:30,200
our system so in this case is the

903
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:33,020
consensus here it's not very complex

904
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,790
just what if I whether you have you have

905
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,310
the legal identity or whether you have

906
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:39,560
the right to control the traffic's to to

907
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:42,950
publish the the relative information

908
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:45,980
here so what we need to do the the

909
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:47,609
complex consensus algorithm may be used

910
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:54,300
to other

911
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:57,840
other part of this thank you I'm not

912
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,310
gonna straight the other you clarify us

913
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,390
all points

914
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:06,840
I heard this term like centralize the

915
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:08,970
name and location I think maybe we

916
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,820
should discuss whether to centralize the

917
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:15,810
name allocation the actuaries working on

918
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:18,120
hierarchical namespace for example oh

919
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,529
yeah I forgot my name Alicia John from

920
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,560
UCLA

921
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:25,530
you shall we had the older freedom doing

922
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,500
our own limitation because of us a

923
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:33,570
hierarchical system oh that I guess

924
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:35,610
powered it's and only pays the fees so I

925
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,730
wouldn't count as a centralized naming

926
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:41,280
system because in the lower part is

927
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:45,530
completely distributed so I think this

928
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:52,380
conceptual distinction may be important

929
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:54,080
to keep in mind and I hope to stay and I

930
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:58,890
think a judgment a little hard on you

931
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:01,770
but but he's correct that is four

932
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:04,980
addresses that namespaces you cannot use

933
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:07,350
this whole team this listener you know

934
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:11,280
what do you have damage you feel the

935
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:14,759
lighter so I choice the same problem

936
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:19,610
that I spirity stuff to new unified

937
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,610
tribe but you don't solve their power

938
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:27,600
finger possessor Edina lispers that net

939
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:30,300
so the comments Jeff we're making about

940
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,610
allocation of prefixes is because the I

941
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,770
think the way you proposed it was I want

942
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:37,290
to take this slash tweet or prefix and

943
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:40,770
if I'm the first one in front of the

944
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:45,509
line I get it no not actually enough not

945
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:48,300
actually I had not lying to you if I say

946
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:50,400
I'm Dino and my private key sides a

947
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,430
transaction that says I want to slash 24

948
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,680
you told him that you will give him that

949
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:58,509
right that transaction and therefore I

950
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:03,009
it looks like I own slash 24

951
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:05,430
they're not actually so about the IP

952
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:09,040
address IP perfect an IP address

953
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:12,970
allocation the work is included in our

954
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,610
last year's presentation and we may

955
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:18,370
check it later so we have a different

956
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,940
method to solve this property solve the

957
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:22,210
problem

958
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,160
one for the a build up a new system and

959
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:28,110
the other one is to we can use the

960
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:32,920
current scheme to keep control of the

961
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:36,760
unique yes really

962
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,850
we only here we only express the word

963
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,370
rubbish verification function just

964
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:45,339
distribute away and essentially and then

965
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:47,710
we can actually we can keep the control

966
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:51,610
right to the current system we can't do

967
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,890
that you don't need smart contracts

968
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:58,210
because it's no different than buying

969
00:51:53,890 --> 00:52:01,120
something if I a keyholder and I have a

970
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,890
balance and I want to debit coins or

971
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,870
tokens whatever for my account to buy

972
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:07,270
something and you're the owner of

973
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,680
something because you've been authorized

974
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:11,650
to be the owner in this transaction

975
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:14,890
takes place a ledger is useful to know

976
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:18,100
that right has allocated via slash 24

977
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:21,279
and right has the authority to be able

978
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:23,380
to do okay and so the fact this is no

979
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,240
different than a token offering you can

980
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,970
have a token reserve and you allocate

981
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:30,250
tokens basically to owners just like

982
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,529
prefixes are allocated to read things

983
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:36,010
and when I want to go ahead and get us

984
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:37,840
last one for I pay money to ripe and

985
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,910
that transaction is recorded on the

986
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,350
ledger that's how it could work as I

987
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,390
think a smart contract is just

988
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:47,830
complicating the situation this is no

989
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:50,379
different than like a token offering hi

990
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:52,930
George Michaelson from a pending you did

991
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:55,480
present last year on a model of address

992
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:58,919
distribution and hierarchy using the

993
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:02,080
chain and at the time we critiqued

994
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,780
fundamental behaviors of that contract

995
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,299
we critiqued it with things that I do

996
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,970
not believe you can resolve in

997
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,690
particular if I have an assertion in a

998
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:13,730
contract on the chain

999
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:17,540
that I have a prefix a large

1000
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:23,810
encompassing prefix validly and I lose

1001
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:28,310
my key then you must assert the etherium

1002
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:31,940
logic of magic rights and to reassert

1003
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:35,509
the lock bank into the chain which in

1004
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:38,589
effect means you cannot trust the innate

1005
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:42,980
properties of the chain you must bless

1006
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:46,549
somebody to fix the chain who do you

1007
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:49,130
bless so this is not proven unique to

1008
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:52,460
the IP address mapping in the chain this

1009
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:55,790
problem exists in any FinTech model

1010
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:59,300
using block chains if you wish real

1011
00:53:55,790 --> 00:54:02,230
money to be represented in chance and

1012
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:05,300
allow loss of value with lots of kids

1013
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:07,490
every banking system in the world every

1014
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,920
type a letter in the world ultimately

1015
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:14,209
says oh it's okay

1016
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:18,230
I have a magic key you have centralized

1017
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:21,710
the authority of the magic reset key you

1018
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:24,650
do not actually have distribution that

1019
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:27,109
was the fundamental of our critique I

1020
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:30,859
would also like to say I agree with the

1021
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:35,078
previous marriage public ledger crypto

1022
00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:37,549
backed an unrepeatable public ledger is

1023
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:40,040
fundamentally what is needed to be the

1024
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,869
visible state of a system if you want

1025
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,960
some degree of assurance of

1026
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:47,569
responsibility the blockchain is not the

1027
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,920
value proposition the public ledger is

1028
00:54:47,569 --> 00:54:55,009
the value proposition thank you so it

1029
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,349
was in the line after you don't even you

1030
00:54:55,010 --> 00:55:00,410
say UPC personal thick so it's like

1031
00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:02,270
sorry coming sounded promising keys

1032
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:04,129
there are mechanisms to tackle it so

1033
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,569
it's not that it is your priority here

1034
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,790
also Tocqueville says you can't a lot of

1035
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:10,720
static and put some special logic the

1036
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:14,660
blockchain to record blocks so it's not

1037
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:17,240
say yes or no questions I think it needs

1038
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,279
further await you know it's a pro

1039
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,669
Americans have now when you

1040
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,790
and also regarding how you how your sign

1041
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:27,770
the property I'm going to point out that

1042
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:29,600
if you do a private-public deployment I

1043
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:32,210
agree that you need some registry or

1044
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,250
some public key that it has all that as

1045
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:37,220
a space panel located but if you want to

1046
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:40,930
do a private deployment you could have

1047
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:44,419
like a authority that has all the

1048
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:47,500
addresses and all the parties agree that

1049
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:49,880
each donor cd25 a deployment one cares

1050
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:58,970
we cut the line after is ready it can

1051
00:55:49,880 --> 00:56:01,760
you be really quickly has a business

1052
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:04,939
relationship that could you use a smile

1053
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:09,800
contract to sublease to lease out submit

1054
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:11,020
a use i wanna borrow a whole range of

1055
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,780
addresses

1056
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:17,930
mr. a s1 for six months I just do that

1057
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:22,310
honest man and all of these people do

1058
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:23,210
that okay oh I know yeah smart contracts

1059
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:27,080
are not so bad

1060
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:29,090
ya feel it depends on the function of

1061
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,620
day as the contract yes

1062
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:35,920
so just one one sentence to say to say

1063
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:39,410
since thank you for all the comments

1064
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,960
argues questions for for the

1065
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:44,480
presentation sauce so I believe that we

1066
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,540
should open our mind open our attitude

1067
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:52,160
for this new potential technology to see

1068
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:54,440
whether they can bring us benefit or we

1069
00:56:52,160 --> 00:57:00,250
can bring us new potential opportunities

1070
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:03,200
to build up new functions and bring more

1071
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,970
benefit income for our current never

1072
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,850
thank you thank you doctor yeah thanks

1073
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:11,270
yes but we should also take the critique

1074
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:14,779
seriously and so we love it if we could

1075
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:17,000
actually continue this conversation on

1076
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:19,430
the mailing list and if your team was

1077
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,500
able to to respond to the points that we

1078
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,529
heard today of course thank you thank

1079
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,530
you

1080
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:51,419
okay let's see how this one goes so I

1081
00:57:48,509 --> 00:57:56,329
want to be quick then I can leave enough

1082
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:56,329
time for you to give me your criticism

1083
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:03,180
so you know thanks for Cheers

1084
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:07,140
give me this opportunity I'm a little

1085
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:14,430
scared although I've been longtime cover

1086
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:15,650
for ITF but my view tend to be

1087
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:19,680
outrageous

1088
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:23,430
so that'd be tender with me so I think

1089
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:26,700
that for the centralization it's a

1090
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:43,558
really important topic that's why you

1091
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:45,740
blog about super wonder my other richest

1092
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:51,089
opinions here I think a decentralization

1093
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:55,500
needs to be from the ground up I want to

1094
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:58,619
make some kind of a name for it so that

1095
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:04,619
I can claim I owned this creation

1096
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:08,960
I can use it just the PDF get rid of

1097
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:08,960
fire or this animation if that's easier

1098
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:24,359
the pony decide whether blockchain is a

1099
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:26,430
road towards decentralization that's my

1100
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:27,029
first point I'd like to discuss with you

1101
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:32,700
guys

1102
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:33,359
someone sides is it go now I'll take

1103
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,589
this one

1104
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:39,990
okay you know more taken shoulders so

1105
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:41,690
people say that the blockchain is I

1106
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,649
wrote two other

1107
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:47,990
centralization because it has no obvious

1108
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:50,240
central controllers this old cart only

1109
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:52,549
four people old enough you saw this is

1110
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,950
so Millie er that not only that

1111
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:56,750
blockchain has no central controllers it

1112
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,490
didn't even have identities it just

1113
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:02,240
likes the cartoon size on the internet

1114
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:06,169
nobody knows you are doc okay for that

1115
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:09,279
matter so on the software we trust but

1116
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:12,250
does this vlog change them especially

1117
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:15,380
represented by the Bitcoin approach

1118
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:17,500
can't beat us to decentralization my

1119
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:20,660
personal view is that they cannot

1120
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:26,560
because it's a mama city actually is a

1121
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:29,660
killer the only way you can get it the

1122
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:33,560
the system is about this show your

1123
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:36,490
muscle you know proof of work who can do

1124
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:39,100
the most amount of a proof of work

1125
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:42,649
whoever has the most the resources

1126
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:44,360
there's lots of academic publications

1127
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:47,120
that did the measurement is showing that

1128
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:52,100
where are the major players a big

1129
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:55,880
players on the Bitcoin I think that the

1130
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:58,910
number is something like a 75% or so

1131
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:02,930
Oh located in China because there are

1132
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:04,430
people who gave me this technology this

1133
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:06,169
before the Chinese government it is

1134
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:09,129
something against it

1135
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:14,300
giving the technology to make the profit

1136
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:18,170
so therefore this proof of work of proof

1137
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:20,120
of acts kappa snake can be storage can

1138
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:23,270
be anything but as long as you want to

1139
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:26,799
say approve of a resources this is

1140
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:29,690
really making the rich get richer

1141
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,760
because the more resources you have the

1142
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:33,230
more power you have in the system even

1143
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,020
though you are anonymous so called

1144
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:39,200
anonymous but there is a different

1145
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:42,320
approaches to this proudly defined the

1146
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,560
blockchain interaction let's distribute

1147
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,480
the lecture i think someone mentioned i

1148
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:49,759
so let's can be represented by this a

1149
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,610
specific example called a hyper ledger

1150
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,640
i give you the pointer there how is

1151
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:58,310
hyper writer different from Provo

1152
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,279
work Fluxion first of all we can see

1153
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:02,330
that hypervisor is doing something

1154
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,370
important relevance

1155
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:05,509
like a case study and the change of

1156
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:08,150
healthcare stuff

1157
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:10,310
I think the later there is the financial

1158
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:13,330
discussions or something that believed

1159
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:16,190
us I haven't heard that yet but a Mac

1160
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:16,940
McCarty is that it goes on the same

1161
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,480
direction

1162
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:22,670
what is that the same direction here's a

1163
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,950
statement it says that we're happy light

1164
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:28,220
rail fabric bricks from some other

1165
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:31,460
blockchain systems is that a to the

1166
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:34,160
private and the permission rather than

1167
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:36,200
open permission rather than open

1168
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,930
permission is a system that allow

1169
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:41,029
unknown entities to participate in the

1170
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:43,009
network therefore you require protocols

1171
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:45,110
like for offer work to validate in

1172
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:47,180
transactions it's not so much validate

1173
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:49,550
is really gating the transactions to say

1174
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:53,629
whatever have a power you can prove your

1175
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:56,330
stuff whoever not poor you cannot so the

1176
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:58,400
memberships in the hippolyta fabric you

1177
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:03,440
know through a trusted membership

1178
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:06,200
service provider now we may have a

1179
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,820
question wouldn't this my fee

1180
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:13,370
become the new central controller I must

1181
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:15,980
admit that I only learned about HEPA

1182
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:17,779
lighter like three weeks ago and I've

1183
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:20,180
been mostly on the road so having it

1184
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:21,350
dived into the literature to see exactly

1185
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:24,830
the how it works

1186
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:27,500
but I cannot cut a rough idea I cannot

1187
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:30,980
talk give you specifics of how Elisha I

1188
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:33,770
want to show you another example which

1189
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:35,540
is I think we evolved or something along

1190
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,040
the same interaction like a hypervisor

1191
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:40,880
but before we knew it

1192
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:43,220
so call me ignorant there's so much

1193
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,400
stuff going on under the song sometimes

1194
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:49,759
I feel justified not knowing everything

1195
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,590
but I'm trying to catch up this other

1196
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,870
example actually the something we've

1197
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:58,130
been working on for the last couple of

1198
01:03:53,870 --> 01:04:01,310
years there's a very drafty

1199
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:03,500
draft hanging on the archive don't kill

1200
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:06,950
me if that son said something wrong

1201
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:09,230
because still it's just a work in

1202
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:13,009
progress but I found oh sure

1203
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:15,320
the logistic after the basic idea so so

1204
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:17,630
it's a theologia it's really kind of a

1205
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:21,050
tool it's really to shoot the lighter

1206
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:23,960
better facilitate the security solution

1207
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:26,000
be one moment myself is not security it

1208
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,870
doesn't come to use provide security per

1209
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,600
se but it's a very effective in a

1210
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:35,170
powerful tool so essentially it's

1211
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,940
immutable distributed ledger that

1212
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:40,610
requires all the entities in the system

1213
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:45,620
lock everything we do into the lighter

1214
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:49,130
and the through some clever recording

1215
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:51,170
entry scheme we call the interlock to

1216
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:54,970
make the whole system to be totally in

1217
01:04:51,170 --> 01:05:00,350
immutable no single party including like

1218
01:04:54,970 --> 01:05:04,279
this eternity management provider can

1219
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:08,420
make changes to the system without being

1220
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:10,640
publicly locked into the system so just

1221
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:14,750
like all the other members that I need a

1222
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:18,170
manager in the later our design master

1223
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:21,170
and always actions prove our new members

1224
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:23,930
issuing of a certificate a real

1225
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:28,310
vocational certificate everything you

1226
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:31,399
lock into this immutable ledger mistakes

1227
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:36,920
cracker actions everything crashes

1228
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:39,770
failures so what good does it do this

1229
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:43,070
actually based on some very old idea we

1230
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:45,920
had the published you can see that the

1231
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:47,920
modern tank is ago in that short paper

1232
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,750
called securities through publicity

1233
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:53,600
again don't kill me if that paper said

1234
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:55,760
something wrong because you have to to

1235
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:58,069
focus for mistakes because that's old

1236
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,440
but nevertheless I think the guys some

1237
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:03,320
basic ideas right it decides that the

1238
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:05,540
key principle behind this design we call

1239
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,730
the PS ki I don't even remember what PS

1240
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:09,770
care stand for is the PS is definitely

1241
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:12,830
public space may be knowledge

1242
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:16,370
infrastructure because this statement is

1243
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:18,560
that every action should be made in a

1244
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:21,109
public space this public space concept

1245
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,900
you know we're part from others derives

1246
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:25,810
from a similar principle

1247
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:30,970
to those in other areas of public

1248
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:33,540
knowledge acting in public does not

1249
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:37,180
guarantee that the actions is correct

1250
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:40,120
but it does provide users with a

1251
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:43,089
quantifiable set of information what has

1252
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:45,130
happened who has done what the

1253
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:46,930
information semantics of the enables

1254
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:51,010
applications to construct their

1255
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:56,799
meaningful actions decisions based on

1256
01:06:51,010 --> 01:07:00,760
laws whatever things happened I think

1257
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:03,490
this really echoes back for some comment

1258
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,950
I heard earlier that the most actually

1259
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:09,790
one most useful tools is this distribute

1260
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:12,220
ledger immutable distributed available

1261
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:17,680
everywhere and this tool will help us

1262
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:22,330
build the future secure systems alta

1263
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:26,020
also said mention that this identity

1264
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:28,960
management is important you cannot just

1265
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:31,660
you know push off that idea to say

1266
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:35,050
whoever grabbed the identity first will

1267
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:38,879
will be the ownership that's not the

1268
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:42,900
solution to the problem the so-called

1269
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,790
thing as as a centralized the name

1270
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:48,930
allocation system I think as my personal

1271
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:53,380
opinion as to incorrect statement I

1272
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:57,580
think the unique namespace is critical

1273
01:07:53,380 --> 01:08:01,180
for healthy internet and uh and that's

1274
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:04,390
what the icons Tod allocation is about

1275
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:06,879
it's not centralized and naming name

1276
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:10,210
allocation system because the beyond the

1277
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:13,030
TLD every single party has their freedom

1278
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:17,140
to to their own name allocation this

1279
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:20,680
hierarchy is needed just to assure the

1280
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:23,970
name space uniqueness and also I'll make

1281
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:27,700
another point that is the namespace

1282
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:30,970
identity aids and should be decoupled

1283
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:33,490
from your trusted relations it doesn't

1284
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:36,530
mean that there is a TS name as a charge

1285
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:39,380
worthy party and light

1286
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:41,509
must be separate loud you can share with

1287
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:43,609
someone under the same hierarchy it

1288
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:46,160
doesn't necessarily mean you trust it

1289
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:48,649
how many names under that that come now

1290
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:52,519
I think it's three years back I ask to

1291
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:55,609
someone that this I died that there's

1292
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,710
like 300 million and I don't know what's

1293
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:58,969
the number now how can you trust anyone

1294
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:03,230
under the same domain

1295
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:06,800
it's a trattoria nod but I definitely

1296
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:11,149
give you the unique identity there's one

1297
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:15,830
person one entity that owns that name so

1298
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:19,219
now I want to run animation to disclose

1299
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:23,269
one man at the time what I really mean

1300
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:29,240
by granda it's really need to be from

1301
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:32,060
grant app look at today's distributed

1302
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:36,229
ledger systems they are built on top of

1303
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:40,730
existing tcp/ip protocol stack in will

1304
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:43,849
know that IV had the published this

1305
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:46,639
internet draft under considerations on

1306
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:49,910
internet consolidation has mostly talk

1307
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:52,750
about the consolidations of power at the

1308
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:57,110
state on top about the services

1309
01:09:52,750 --> 01:10:00,490
applications and my conjecture that's

1310
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:03,769
why I say I'm making outrageous opinions

1311
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:08,719
my conjecture is that the consolidation

1312
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:11,210
of the top in a V EE leads to the

1313
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:15,860
consolidation of the supporting

1314
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:18,770
substrate beneath those let's the

1315
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:22,420
inevitable because its nature it's a

1316
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:27,770
market economical drive it's only when

1317
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:31,130
the underlying substrate got a more kind

1318
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:36,440
of consistent with the upper there's a

1319
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:39,020
moral profit to be made if you want to

1320
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:42,019
me give me your proofs evidences I want

1321
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:45,620
to come back with the well prepared

1322
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:47,990
talking exam so therefore if you really

1323
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,940
want to build this distributed ledger as

1324
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:53,000
a useful tool

1325
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:56,169
towards a decentralization you need to

1326
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,910
build this lighter and pop alpha

1327
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:01,490
decentralize the system decentralize the

1328
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:04,519
network protocol and now here I give you

1329
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:07,610
this one example so I'd be larger it's a

1330
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:11,480
built to run on top of our name the data

1331
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:13,700
networking I bet not many people have

1332
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,709
heard this a password in the end so

1333
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:18,190
here's a pointer you can take a look

1334
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:21,800
this is a project has been going on

1335
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:24,469
officially since 2010 but the vent

1336
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,170
jaqobis in our familiar name to many of

1337
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:31,610
you he even the first talk in this

1338
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:34,700
direction in 2006 again the concept has

1339
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:38,059
been there for a long time what have we

1340
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:43,280
done overall our ears other than burn

1341
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:45,490
your taxpayer dollars we we have matured

1342
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:48,830
the concept we have the build a

1343
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:54,950
prototype running system and I think we

1344
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:58,250
now know how to load out now in the last

1345
01:11:54,950 --> 01:12:01,820
of the invitation so what we're on is a

1346
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:03,470
new Andean community meeting and that

1347
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:06,880
thanks to an East they will be hosting

1348
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:10,250
this year's meeting not too far from now

1349
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:13,280
in Washington DC so whoever interested

1350
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:16,370
take a look at our back of our flyers on

1351
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:20,630
the ITF registration desk thank you very

1352
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:28,280
much thank you we have time for one

1353
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:31,760
question thinking through the previous

1354
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:34,969
session and then this one I'm thinking

1355
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,180
that ledger technology is not really

1356
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:40,850
very good for this DS decentralizing

1357
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:45,040
control but there's an another type of

1358
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:48,640
security and that's accountability it is

1359
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:51,500
extremely effective at D centralizing

1360
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,990
accountability because if you have an

1361
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:57,130
authority that you give a task and they

1362
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:59,809
put the information into the log then

1363
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:02,630
everybody can audit them which is of

1364
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:03,470
course the heart of trans so if we stop

1365
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:06,560
thinking about

1366
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:09,760
security purely in terms of access

1367
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:12,710
control and instead broaden our view to

1368
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,800
accountability a lot of this makes a lot

1369
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:19,730
more sense but I don't see a lot of this

1370
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:22,520
let's say what is that you need let

1371
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:23,870
Elijah because of show you have to be

1372
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,600
accountable because the everything you

1373
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:31,610
do would be in public and you can no

1374
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:33,140
longer change it just to again think

1375
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:34,820
about this talk and the previous talk

1376
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:38,720
together sorry Jonathan rowing club that

1377
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:42,740
um wouldn't the sort of block chains

1378
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:47,060
that canonical way of doing this be if I

1379
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:48,769
want you know slash zero of or like if I

1380
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,690
want the entire internet and I just have

1381
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:54,140
to get more than half the people to

1382
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:56,870
agree with me and so it you can have it

1383
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:59,900
you don't have to bless anyone per se

1384
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:01,460
you can just say as long as half of

1385
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:08,450
people agree that I own this address I

1386
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:10,850
own it or I answer that one with respect

1387
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:13,910
to what Lisa just said very shortly you

1388
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:17,420
know no because we have two models proof

1389
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:19,760
of ways for work and identity what Lisa

1390
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,920
was just talking about was identity in

1391
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:24,200
order to get into the ledger what you're

1392
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,120
saying is if you need over half of

1393
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,910
something that would be proof of waste

1394
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:37,010
they're very different ways of using the

1395
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:38,960
same structure yes exactly right now

1396
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:42,470
finish and what she's saying from the

1397
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,390
ground up she's picking identity to

1398
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:51,080
enter which is completely different than

1399
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:52,970
proof of waste I would love to see

1400
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,890
research that shows that you can use

1401
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:57,260
them together effectively without one

1402
01:14:54,890 --> 01:15:02,420
totally overtaking the other I've not

1403
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:04,610
seen it okay thank you this thank you

1404
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:06,440
for pinch and have a see mmm but that

1405
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:10,219
won't come criticisms afterwards it

1406
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:13,160
should me my emails okay great so this

1407
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:16,040

1410
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,960

talk at some point yeah sorry yeah no um

1412
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,909
but we can take that to the mailing list

1413
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:36,170
in the interest of giving to the its

1414

now so as you see the g20 community to

1422
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:10,870
community mentioned about it I mean I'm

1423

the g20 of quirk anyway so so let me

1425
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:20,349
describe what happened in a dream to

1426
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:24,040
industry of Coca so let me first

1427
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:26,320
discovered g20 s and so G said means a

1428
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:29,650
Canada France Germany Italy Japan UK and

1429
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:34,059
the US and g8 g20 is 20 countries

1430
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:36,339
including a g7 so the g20 finance

1431
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:39,640
ministers and central bank governors a

1432
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:43,780
meeting which held in Fukuoka this year

1433
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:46,330
is in that the financial ministers and

1434
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:50,080
central bank governors of the each of

1435
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:51,910
the gee-gees g20 countries trust IMF and

1436
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:54,790
the World Bank to cetera that is a

1437
01:22:51,910 --> 01:23:01,510
tweety tweety Fukuoka meeting consists

1438
01:22:54,790 --> 01:23:06,910
all so traveler to the meeting this was

1439
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:10,060
happened initiated by the quest from

1440
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:13,000
Japanese Japanese government that

1441
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:17,280
fSV Financial Stability Board you may

1442
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:22,540
like heard of it from the news is a

1443
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:26,170
published report on a July 6 2009 team

1444
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:29,490
that is just before the g20 of coke a

1445
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:33,030
meeting the document is initiated from

1446
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:39,099
the request form of Japanese people and

1447
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:43,240
what the document says is was it is

1448
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:46,360
important to have a dialogue between the

1449
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:47,940
financial regulators and technology tech

1450
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,599
communities

1451
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:53,919
stakeholders including the tech

1452
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:56,710
communities so this exact statement

1453
01:23:53,920 --> 01:24:01,470
appears in the report and it appeared

1454
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:07,360
just before the g20 of Coca meeting so

1455
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:09,640
we were working on to have a workshop

1456
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:13,210
called the high-level seminar

1457
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:16,870
financial innovation out of during the

1458
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:21,520
Crocker meeting then at a meeting the

1459
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:24,519
attendees of the g20 meeting come to the

1460
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:29,530
session under listen to the dis panel

1461
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:31,920
what these panels discusses so the

1462
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:34,210
picture is that it is small so you'd

1463
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:37,780
well I'm not sure whether you can see

1464
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:39,430
you not but it's a it this session is a

1465
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:41,349
model a with the data to by Jim were

1466
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:45,160
Professor Joe Mariah by the project to

1467
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:47,740
carry diversity and also with Professor

1468
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:51,280
Matt so from Georgetown University's on

1469
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:53,950
the board on the punished and also I

1470
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:58,660
want to mention that dr. Adam back who

1471
01:24:53,950 --> 01:25:01,780
is a very famous cyberpunk is also on

1472
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:07,500
the board on the on the on the meeting

1473
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:10,389
to talk under these specific topics so

1474
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:12,880
the finest of Governors of the other

1475
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:16,590
guys listen to the these Christ's

1476
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:21,240
heart so this meeting itself is a

1477
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:28,270
multi-stakeholder simulation or talk

1478
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:30,940
among the stakeholders so finally each

1479
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:36,210
of these meeting is each publisher

1480
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:43,599
communicate under in this communicate we

1481
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:46,000
can see the de Sade's para that the

1482
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:49,780
mentioning that we will come to efface

1483
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:53,020
which directly or whatever so so it is

1484
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:55,090
minced in cities differenced to the

1485
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:59,560
document deficit we just published and

1486
01:25:55,090 --> 01:26:02,020
saying it is important and I think this

1487
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,250
is a way the communique load but we

1488
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:06,640
welcome

1489
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:10,000
means that we are listening to

1490
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:13,930
so this they are sure they understand

1491
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,780
that this topic is very product and I

1492
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:21,450
want to mention that if you click the

1493
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:25,259
link I ask to the core

1494
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:27,870
artificial with this meeting that at the

1495
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:31,710
leading there are several opening

1496
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:33,570
remarks and Walmsley mark is spoken by

1497
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:36,810
that Toshi the endo that is a

1498
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:39,889
commissioner of the gfs a and he

1499
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:44,780
mentioned that without about the IETF

1500
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:48,780
that is unusual but they understand that

1501
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:50,969
IETF is important role in the Internet

1502
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:53,969
they cannot deployment and internet

1503
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:58,290
second technology development so they

1504
01:26:53,970 --> 01:27:03,180
think that it they think that it is

1505
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:07,440
important to have similar people working

1506
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:10,260
together with them to make possibly the

1507
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:15,629
standardization I don't know but to add

1508
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:20,400
to have a better multi district with the

1509
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:25,650
discussion forums so take committee in

1510
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:28,259
trouser that now the greatest in the g20

1511
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:31,830
country share the idea that it is

1512
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:34,470
crucial to harbor such a dialogue among

1513
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:40,200
the stakeholders including the

1514
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:43,190
committee's so and also for the legatus

1515
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:46,740
point of view the most critical part

1516
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:49,139
critical issues are consumer protection

1517
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:50,880
and the prevention of the usual

1518
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:56,040
technology for criminal activities

1519
01:27:50,880 --> 01:28:01,550
including them money handling but also

1520
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:03,860
he they understand that say blocking

1521
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:07,740
innovation is a bad idea

1522
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:10,679
working the innovation by allegation is

1523
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:14,400
about area in this context so they want

1524
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:18,120
to promote but at least they want to

1525
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:22,129
prevent these to each part that they

1526
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:28,830
want to discuss with these two issues

1527
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:31,970
even in a minor so I'm going to the Q&A

1528
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:35,189
but the far from first let me quickly

1529
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:42,329
leave you some numbers a comment I

1530
01:28:35,189 --> 01:28:44,639
crumbs a baby email so several people

1531
01:28:42,329 --> 01:28:46,379
mentioned in the DNA are three Mariners

1532
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,719
the Internet has a crucial role to

1533
01:28:46,379 --> 01:28:54,559
establish the atps technology that is

1534
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:57,869
given right so of course it is right

1535
01:28:54,559 --> 01:29:01,409
under dat relying on some ability of

1536
01:28:57,869 --> 01:29:05,699
documents of course Anna I know there

1537
01:29:01,409 --> 01:29:10,499
are tons of problem directed to the use

1538
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:15,619
of the bat ciphers which is not well

1539
01:29:10,499 --> 01:29:21,239
understood and they're the guys who is

1540
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:24,148
creating a new ciphers but as we know

1541
01:29:21,239 --> 01:29:27,030
that we are very carefully pick ciphers

1542
01:29:24,149 --> 01:29:29,699
to to be deployed and the control

1543
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:31,169
controlling that from the IDF's document

1544
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:33,839
so that's a good idea

1545
01:29:31,169 --> 01:29:36,379
so no they are relying on such kind of

1546
01:29:33,839 --> 01:29:41,849
document I want to also mention about

1547
01:29:36,379 --> 01:29:45,179
some of the discussion by negationism

1548
01:29:41,849 --> 01:29:46,649
over there on generic security

1549
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:49,019
consideration for the crypt asset

1550
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:53,699
coastal yes that kind of document might

1551
01:29:49,019 --> 01:29:57,239
be useful but I'm personally think this

1552
01:29:53,699 --> 01:29:59,969
document fits to the IETF community or

1553
01:29:57,239 --> 01:30:02,879
not I'm wondering whether it is okay or

1554
01:29:59,969 --> 01:30:04,800
not so we need to find out that the

1555
01:30:02,879 --> 01:30:06,089
light we need to discuss this also this

1556
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,039
sort of a technique of course of course

1557
01:30:06,089 --> 01:30:10,699
a courier is how far is that the ITF

1558
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:14,219
work of course and are possibly other

1559
01:30:10,699 --> 01:30:17,339
document might be under the control of

1560
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:20,519
the ITF but I'm not sure on the lower

1561
01:30:17,339 --> 01:30:23,309
part of that this is right but but it is

1562
01:30:20,519 --> 01:30:25,649
in this it is clear that this kind of

1563
01:30:23,309 --> 01:30:29,609
document is a product among to share

1564
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:32,760
among communities so interpretability

1565
01:30:29,609 --> 01:30:35,339
neither say we understand the impetus of

1566
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:37,229
interoperability so everybody talked

1567
01:30:35,339 --> 01:30:39,479
about interval interval that it is

1568
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:42,179
imported some of some of the people want

1569
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:46,260
to discuss about interoperability with

1570
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:47,920
the proxy technologies and that too but

1571
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:51,600
I think it

1572
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:54,370
is too early to think about

1573
01:30:51,600 --> 01:31:00,190
standardization of DRT will interfere

1574
01:30:54,370 --> 01:31:02,559
with your DLT so I honestly think it is

1575
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:05,320
too early on the way we do we can't do

1576
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:11,699
that in the future but at this moment it

1577
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:14,019
is too early so I'm not into this yet

1578
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:17,410
still we need to find out a good

1579
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:20,530
architecture for deity I don't know but

1580
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:24,099
we needed it before we start working on

1581
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:30,309
data standardization and of course

1582
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:34,270
there's no defector standards yet so -

1583
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:36,730
we do care about finance a lot so the

1584
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:39,580
entity relationship to finance internals

1585
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:41,709
technology is important since deity

1586
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:46,390
depends on the Internet as we discussed

1587
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:47,219
but any application depends on internet

1588
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:51,340
type

1589
01:31:47,219 --> 01:31:53,500
so why he did not and the possible

1590
01:31:51,340 --> 01:32:00,160
engine in the certain context it might

1591
01:31:53,500 --> 01:32:05,320
be more more important and I may skip

1592
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:07,269
some of the slides but anyway so someone

1593
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:10,059
was a quick discussion in our mind is

1594
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:14,590
that somebody mentioned about whether we

1595
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:22,320
can discuss I used I is over iqt UI TFW

1596
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:24,670
sushi I have no idea of course these

1597
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:28,570
communities each of this committee has

1598
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:31,840
on go and the different stake so it is

1599
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:35,650
not simple answer but like the document

1600
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:40,510
I mentioned and created by the cocoon is

1601
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:44,920
that it doesn't fit any of them right

1602
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:51,580
but important so we may need to have a

1603
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:53,710
new place or we can fit try to fit in

1604
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:56,440
some of the community I don't know but

1605
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:58,840
at least we need to find out what kind

1606
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,820
of document we need to be standardized

1607
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:04,300
and aware to have her

1608
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:10,679
to do that activities and some of the

1609
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:13,989
mentions about a IP is a DML the prevent

1610
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:17,170
proposal thank were bitter comment self

1611
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:21,250
as a VIP and as a each of the software

1612
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:25,659
process of the development community has

1613
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:28,420
adopted their own way to control system

1614
01:33:25,659 --> 01:33:30,699
and for that standardization but that we

1615
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:33,520
process we need something but I'm not

1616
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:37,138
sure under we need to discuss and we

1617
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:48,150
want to listen to it have a community

1618
01:33:37,139 --> 01:33:51,429
because liberators or g20 decorators

1619
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:56,049
want to talk to somebody in a tech

1620
01:33:51,429 --> 01:33:58,659
committee who want to talk to such kind

1621
01:33:56,050 --> 01:34:00,730
of people it's a question and we need to

1622
01:33:58,659 --> 01:34:04,690
find out a way to do that and this

1623
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:07,239
potentially affect some of the work we

1624
01:34:04,690 --> 01:34:09,790
are doing here I think somebody many

1625
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:13,239
people may not think this is not like a

1626
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:16,630
flock we did not have relationship with

1627
01:34:13,239 --> 01:34:19,480
that is worked work I think it does

1628
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:23,139
might be true but it has a potential

1629
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:26,230
that we need to be influenced by these

1630
01:34:23,139 --> 01:34:30,460
kind of activities so studying earlier

1631
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:33,759
there so I asked to have this meeting to

1632
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:37,119
start dialogue with people in IETF

1633
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:42,699
Committee so this is my interrupted part

1634
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:45,659
so please provide accommodation on the

1635
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:45,659
comments if you have

1636
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:02,910
society but speaking in my personal

1637
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:07,320
capacity it's just a clarifying question

1638
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:10,680
what I didn't understand fully I heard

1639
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:13,849
from you that the g20 finance people are

1640
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:16,020
interested in speaking to tech community

1641
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:20,720
particularly the standards community but

1642
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:23,100
what's not clear to me is what kind of

1643
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,300
conversation do they want to have what

1644
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:28,590
are they interested in understanding

1645
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:30,720
what help do they need purpose if you

1646
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:36,330
qualify that it morpholino be helpful

1647
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:39,750
things a lot of things this is very very

1648
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:43,410
specific I think that they want to find

1649
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:48,630
out how they can prevent money

1650
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:53,340
laundering and that is very related to

1651
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:56,880
the how the identity is managed of

1652
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:59,940
course Caesar if you want to prevent

1653
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:02,850
that you need to do a Qureshi to buy

1654
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:08,070
bounds or Leo physical person towards us

1655
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:09,810
some rigt in the cyberspace whatever so

1656
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:12,420
there's a ton of discussion we need to

1657
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:14,430
do but the touches of one of the

1658
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:16,440
examples a and literally interested in

1659
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:19,320
need to talk with people to solve those

1660
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:33,179
issues without preventing the

1661
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:37,380
inhibitions so both the g20 people and

1662
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:40,290
at ATF this is the they are the number

1663
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:45,000
one concern is anti monthly and AML kyc

1664
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:49,110
an anti terrorist financing raises and

1665
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:50,670
so IBM has a whole to set of stuff could

1666
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:56,309
give out for the past thirty something

1667
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:59,850
years x.509 starts could use it for that

1668
01:36:56,310 --> 01:37:03,690
I was looking at the discrete pieces now

1669
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:05,840
the crypto assets draft terminology very

1670
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:07,370
good

1671
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,750
suggestion would be to alignment to the

1672
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:14,269
terminology of the f80 a that they call

1673
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:17,480
you know custodian providers as vast

1674
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:19,760
virtual asset service providers and have

1675
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:22,669
a model there already so we good if you

1676
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:26,180
could update that document and also the

1677
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:27,740
cryptic master didn't people I mean they

1678
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,900
should look at them and missus got a key

1679
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:31,370
management life cycle because the

1680
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,780
custodian II this is a centralized

1681
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:35,809
historian this is ever picked you have

1682
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:36,920
to say when you say mister custodian

1683
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,870
even companies you have to say

1684
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,970
centralized or decentralized so in this

1685
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:43,940
paper is centralized in your dragons

1686
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:46,190
that is centralized custodian there's a

1687
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:48,889
whole slew of stuff you can use to

1688
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:50,480
protect the keys of your customers right

1689
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:52,700
and also there's a blend in the sense

1690
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:55,429
that when I open an account with the

1691
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:57,740
custodian I may not be given the key

1692
01:37:55,430 --> 01:38:00,080
here that all the trading is done using

1693
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:02,540
using the one of two keys belonging to

1694
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:04,970
the custodian but but I think this is

1695
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:07,100
back to the original common I think this

1696
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:08,750
might be the group in lights here to

1697
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,190
start talking but in this because

1698
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:12,200
there's definitely a lack of

1699
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:13,910
understanding like the FAA th people

1700
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:17,000
didn't even know and I'm talk about the

1701
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:19,910
Treasury Department first they were all

1702
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,790
even so sufficiently aware of the

1703
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:26,269
existence of x.509 yeah when the

1704
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:27,980
technologies use big time in our you

1705
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:29,960
know US national security infrastructure

1706
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:34,910
you know I just I think it's good

1707
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:38,180
thank you very much transmitted rich

1708
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:42,370
sauce Akamai congratulations this is

1709
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:44,720
like free of height I'm realistic and

1710
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:46,400
wherever and however names up I know

1711
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:48,230
people at my company are gonna follow

1712
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:50,330
along and want to contribute cozbie

1713
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:55,450
done some prototype experiments with

1714
01:38:50,330 --> 01:39:01,180
Mitsubishi Bank so thank you for a

1715
01:38:55,450 --> 01:39:05,720
breath of accurate fresh air thank you I

1716
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:08,740
felt my bacon here I come not to praise

1717
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:16,690
Bitcoin I come to bury it

1718
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:16,690
III really like comment is that yours

1719
01:39:18,139 --> 01:39:27,260
because I'm going to be using that I

1720
01:39:21,999 --> 01:39:30,619
want help working out how to unpick the

1721
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:33,050
Ponzi schemes and the fraud or whatever

1722
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:34,938
I've been thinking about that a lot

1723
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:40,130
there are many points of vulnerability

1724
01:39:34,939 --> 01:39:43,849
in that ecosystem and that ecosystem is

1725
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:46,070
pure fraud I must however what really

1726
01:39:43,849 --> 01:39:49,369
concerns been concerning me is that at

1727
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:53,259
heart they have hijacked of really cool

1728
01:39:49,369 --> 01:39:55,880
technology the harvest Aneta hash chain

1729
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:58,579
that was invented in not me I was

1730
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:00,919
patented in 1990 yeah and that is

1731
01:39:58,579 --> 01:40:04,630
something that can be and should be

1732
01:40:00,919 --> 01:40:07,969
applied I would like to see

1733
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:10,039
infrastructure that allows actually

1734
01:40:07,969 --> 01:40:14,179
applied to projects that isn't

1735
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:18,018
contaminated by all the frauds and all

1736
01:40:14,179 --> 01:40:20,659
the waste I've been doing some work in

1737
01:40:18,019 --> 01:40:23,119
that vein afters I need some facilities

1738
01:40:20,659 --> 01:40:26,509
like that on the mesh but I think that

1739
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:29,419
we need to detach and Libra might well

1740
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:32,959
need part of that detachment because had

1741
01:40:29,419 --> 01:40:36,139
Bitcoin collapsed six months ago

1742
01:40:32,959 --> 01:40:38,229
people might work and said well that's

1743
01:40:36,139 --> 01:40:43,189
because the crypto was wrong and it was

1744
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:45,079
yeah now if you collapse tomorrow then

1745
01:40:43,189 --> 01:40:47,300
people will be saying well of course it

1746
01:40:45,079 --> 01:40:51,429
collapsed because the catalysts came in

1747
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:54,260
and this you know took it over which

1748
01:40:51,429 --> 01:40:55,789
whether it's true or not is a completely

1749
01:40:54,260 --> 01:41:00,709
different story and wouldn't bring the

1750
01:40:55,789 --> 01:41:02,360
rest of crypto down with it thank you so

1751
01:41:00,709 --> 01:41:05,030
Paul Hoffman I'm going back to your

1752
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:06,558
previous slide about where's Tavis I

1753
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:09,978
mean because I think that that was your

1754
01:41:06,559 --> 01:41:13,070
big question um your list is very short

1755
01:41:09,979 --> 01:41:14,959
there at the top and I proposed given

1756
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:18,349
what you said earlier and also the

1757
01:41:14,959 --> 01:41:21,530
answer to the first question from I saw

1758
01:41:18,349 --> 01:41:23,719
I think really where you want to go is

1759
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:26,989
to two places that specialize in

1760
01:41:23,719 --> 01:41:29,360
identity and you know Thomas correctly

1761
01:41:26,989 --> 01:41:30,869
pointed out that we we do some identity

1762
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:33,900
here or we did it 20 years

1763
01:41:30,869 --> 01:41:36,360
sort of finished it but that's just work

1764
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:38,670
that's not describing identity that

1765
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:41,489
doesn't say how you tell that this

1766
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:43,380
person is not this person on that or or

1767
01:41:41,489 --> 01:41:45,480
that this private key is not assisting

1768
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:48,119
this person there are plenty of really

1769
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:51,900
good mature identity communities out

1770
01:41:48,119 --> 01:41:54,089
there some of whom are finance related

1771
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:56,730
many of them who are not but wouldn't

1772
01:41:54,090 --> 01:41:59,010
mind being I would imagine and I think

1773
01:41:56,730 --> 01:42:02,848
those would be the best communities for

1774
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:04,560
you to start with the technologies are

1775
01:42:02,849 --> 01:42:06,630
well known you know it's really just

1776
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:09,090
said we're actually working on something

1777
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:11,580
that is closed happens you know it's

1778
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:13,860
that old it's not you don't have a

1779
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:15,929
technology problem you have an

1780
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:18,540
identification problem and there are

1781
01:42:15,929 --> 01:42:20,940
plenty of groups out there that really

1782
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:22,800
are trying hard to deal with individual

1783
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:24,839
identities different groups are trying

1784
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,960
to deal with corporate identities that

1785
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:32,880
is is this company the same as that

1786
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:34,679
company and is somebody who says that

1787
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,630
they work for this company actually

1788
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:38,520
working for that company we were dealing

1789
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:42,659
with that in the United States at least

1790
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:45,239
right now what does the word Huawei you

1791
01:42:42,659 --> 01:42:47,638
know know things like that so I would

1792
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:50,309
say go to those folks and start to get

1793
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:52,710
that and assume that the technology will

1794
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:55,080
follow if you're finding technology gaps

1795
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:57,270
at that point sure come back I don't

1796
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:59,480
think the w3c would be an appropriate

1797
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:02,670
place on that on that list

1798
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:05,879
itu-t takes their time on things but

1799
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:06,239
actually have a fairly wide range of

1800
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,369
things

1801
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:09,869
IETF with good for point solutions but I

1802
01:43:08,369 --> 01:43:12,210
don't hear that that's what you're

1803
01:43:09,869 --> 01:43:13,980
asking for so look at look at the

1804
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:17,610
identity space there and everybody

1805
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:19,379
people camp or activity identify so good

1806
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:24,089
luck yeah thank you very much yes

1807
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:29,880
actually zest and a job other things so

1808
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:34,980
really undercooked but so it's bringing

1809
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:36,719
here destroyed is too early but I think

1810
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:39,860
it's a suggestion that identity

1811
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:43,290
committee is a great idea I want to

1812
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:44,280
think about that yet of course that was

1813
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:46,590
a list

1814
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:48,929
that seems to be Betty Botta to start

1815
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:51,170
with that so thank you very much for the

1816
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:51,170
comment

1817
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:55,440
I don't know if you just want the

1818
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:57,839
standardization effort to be focused

1819
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:02,040
solely on FinTech but if you consider

1820
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:03,810
leashes ground up approach I I think you

1821
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:06,120
should consider it so we have a holistic

1822
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:08,370
design from the network layer all the

1823
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:10,680
way up to the application I don't know

1824
01:44:08,370 --> 01:44:12,390
if that's boiling the ocean but at least

1825
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:15,090
it's a good place to start

1826
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:20,780
before the organization's get together

1827
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:25,320
thinking at those levels yeah as a

1828
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:27,840
researcher I really like I do yeah when

1829
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:30,509
I of course I wish spend some time on

1830
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,030
the loop sales looking at that of course

1831
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:40,170
thank you very much for comment okay

1832

1855
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:12,540
idea to make a list to discuss erika

1856
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:15,059
weather wizard this is IKEA org but

1857
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:18,390
order haptic how many people integers

1858
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:20,450
think those kind of issues yeah thank

1859

you thank you

1860
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:26,519
when Deshawn fastly seems like the this

1861
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:28,170
would mailing list discussion is highly

1862
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,930
decentralized in a little chaotic as

1863
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:33,780
well there's been a lot of interest in

1864
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:36,000
the possibility of doing something at

1865
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:38,700
the IETF related to decentralization

1866
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,870
something standard you waited and so we

1867
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:41,849
can you know certainly kick off a

1868
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:44,309
discussion about that and with the

1869
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:47,640
possibility of having a side meeting on

1870
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:51,180
the technology itself or even possibly

1871
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:54,840
evolve in Singapore or in in March in

1872
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:58,110
Vancouver so let's use the denied

1873
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:59,640
annealing less energy analyst informed

1874
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:01,620
and we'll see about sending up a

1875
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:07,440
nonworking who know and most of the ITF

1876
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:10,230

1882
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:21,990
communities still very near this is the

1883
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:23,700

1885
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:27,000
