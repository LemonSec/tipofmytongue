35
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:10,100
directory okay so we have more than 10

36
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,530
items today so I think Rogers will work

37
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,959
to our brief introduction of current

38
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,750
token in the stables to everyone here

39
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:24,160
and the armor on any coordinate to me

40
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:27,919
and the team we have ain't craft

41
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,150
discussed at this time and the first one

42
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,150
is a part of the museum

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:42,640
[Music]

44
00:04:48,530 --> 00:05:08,429
[Music]

45
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,619
[Music]

46
00:05:26,750 --> 00:06:24,770
so oh okay

47
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,850
telework we have discussed that this

48
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,680
kind of thing before in those but at the

49
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,020
very beginning of this working group we

50
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,570
think that it may be it's to only to

51
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,130
discuss it for the photo stages but

52
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,670
right now

53
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:47,610
when our pickle Protocol draft has it

54
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:50,430
reaches company complete so some people

55
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,920
think that maybe we can receiving you

56
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,890
and to see whether we are still

57
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:59,250
interested to specify this kind of thing

58
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,849
Oh Oh easy to steer appropriate not

59
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,610
clear for us and so we will see based on

60
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,380
today's discussion okay and then I feel

61
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,960
the last year if we have triangular have

62
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,080
a very short discussion and statement

63
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,570

64
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,450

68
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,980
so I guess med was in the the jabber

69
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,310
room but not in the room I was wondering

70
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,480
about the ten minutes lot for the

71
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:54,030

72
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:57,120
ourselves which slot that was yes yeah

73
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:00,150
you are right this slice has not updated

74
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,240
at these items but to be already listed

75
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,270

76
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,970
will have this part okay yeah sorry it's

77
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:14,640
my a little a little a little mistake

78
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:27,260
okay okay uh we we want to give a very

79
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:33,500
short I don't know why let me try this

80
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,500
and you try this this is good

81
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:46,470
and you will have the mouse okay pick

82
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:49,350
the co2 of our kinda basic protocol

83
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,600
drafters videos silicon where

84
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,180
traditionally have one foster working I

85
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,250
see history supported thoughts through

86
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,370
comments this is a very physical

87
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,450
document and we will finish its publish

88
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,140
publish okay anything we have our

89
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,090
architecture draft it's already

90
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,840
submitted for publication and I think

91
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:15,840
the iest is taking care of who to keep

92
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,480
review comments and we are showing it by

93
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:23,070
our courses okay and your kids draft

94
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,800
um it's just a okay it's all it's also

95
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,890
submitted to for publication and ad is

96
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,800
reviewing it and at the senior in China

97
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:36,060
now today they have updated new version

98
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:39,150
is such a six motion and I think most of

99
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,520
the issues has been addressed but a lot

100
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,230
of discussion on my list is alone for if

101
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,770
you follow them you list so I think

102
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:50,580
maybe now it's very near to the final

103
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:54,270
stage to publish the it's very basic was

104
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,320
you know in China draft okay maybe later

105
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:01,230
our ad can give more updates Oh or what

106
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,090
I thought is enough okay and where the

107
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,440
similar situation is about a teacher now

108
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,760
that the teacher is relatively simple to

109
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,850
the single trainer so I think it's

110
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,450
called smoothly and it's also very near

111
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,550
the end of the publication stages so we

112
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:21,930
can anticipate it will be published data

113
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:25,410
and see very soon okay and then in last

114
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:28,819
meeting we have we have accepted as some

115
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,000
new working group just they are the

116
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,250
multi-homing

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,800
configuration and the solar discovery

118
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,090
and the senior in China go home and the

119
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:43,750
controlling theorists these are all some

120
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:45,399
extension or some some new work aborted

121
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,620
diploma in the consideration of the

122
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,589
total protocol so we see that they are

123
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,769
variable so accept it and we need to

124
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,660
discuss during today's meeting and the

125
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:59,769
later and the to get more feedbacks for

126
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,879
them okay that's all of all of our and

127
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:07,029
current the working group jobs status so

128
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:11,110
in family they all goes where okay okay

129
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:13,600
so I think that's all we want to talk

130
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,170
right now and that secret of we can go

131
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,879
to the presentation yeah French teacher

132
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:25,599
in Han so Fausto drafter is controlling

133
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:29,529
the filtering yeah it's Konami oh sorry

134
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,210

136
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,440
[Music]

137
00:11:42,320 --> 00:12:03,340
yes okay yes yes

138
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,730
we can't hear you

139
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:33,670
joining the food code again so I can I

140
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,670
can accept you

141
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:54,860
is it better right now Frank thank you

142
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,280
yes so the purpose of this of this slot

143
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,560
is to focus on the I would say the only

144
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,910
pending issue we have for the the signal

145
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,520
channel as you know that we have me to

146
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,140
discuss this point that we have for the

147
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,079
build the signal channel and the data

148
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,810
channel for the channel specification

149
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,150
all the discuss points were resolved and

150
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,239
now we are just really for a for been to

151
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:20,209
to do last checks on the draft for the

152
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,400
signal channel we have fixed all the

153
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,710
discuss points there is only one pinning

154
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,840
point from from Maria that we are trying

155
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:31,580
to resolve with the help of the working

156
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,320
group if we as usual so in this in this

157
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,970
presentation we are just we there's a

158
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,280
lot of slides there because the the

159
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,140
intent that we I wanted when I when I

160
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,670
design it slides that it can be self

161
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,860
content that someone can understand what

162
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,870
what is about without having any device

163
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,980
the voice comment so if you can go to

164
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,980
the next slide please

165
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,550
yeah so this is just basic because there

166
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,490
are there is there was a lot of

167
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,130
confusion about the the purpose of why

168
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,260
we need the heard that at all in the in

169
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,630
the in the signal channel specification

170
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,120
so there are there are actually two two

171
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,760
basic sections the first one is to

172
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,790
assess whether the the remote pier is

173
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,860
alive or if it is defunct because

174
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,810
because otherwise if we want to set the

175
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,600
center mitigation request and decision

176
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,270
is broken we will have all the time to

177
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,030
to to to maintain and to mount decision

178
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,550
which which is extra delay and do

179
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,890
mitigation we will take a long time so

180
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,310
we we need to make sure that once we

181
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,890
have the the signal channel is

182
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:36,469
established to maintain it and to assess

183
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,689
regularly that the the the the dots

184
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,850
urgent pier is there and the session is

185
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,010
working well and the second objective is

186
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,410
really obvious is that if if you have

187
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,380
any firewall of any not in the path and

188
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,000
the these firewalls are just flashing

189
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,890
the entries because you are just firing

190
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,200
the the time out we need to make sure

191
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:57,439
that this seat is there so that if there

192
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,030
is any requests back or any sorry

193
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,980
notification back from the server

194
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,339
the server can reach with no problem the

195
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,830
ad client so to do that we the decision

196
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,420
that the design decision was achieved in

197
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,640
the working room is that we just need to

198
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,829
send very directional her bits between

199
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,410
the decision that mean that each dot

200
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,450
spear will send I heard bits to do to

201
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:21,020
the pier and the other one we just sent

202
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,550
another herb it's for the purpose for

203
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,550
the purposes that are already listed in

204
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,380
slides so the the the basic questions

205
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,810
there that why we need bi-directional

206
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,760
her base and why not just using the

207
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,489
unidirectional Horvitz would would be

208
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,620
sufficient so in the next slide we are

209
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,560
just showing why why this is this is

210
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,970
needed this is just a reminder of the I

211
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,920
would say the outcome of the discussion

212
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,330
we had on the working group so if we

213
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,250
have to design the her--but as a

214
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:51,800
unidirectional herb it's a first choice

215
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,580
we have is that it's the the server has

216
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,870
to send to her baton their sides but the

217
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,270
the problem we will have in that case is

218
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,510
that if there is no entry in you know

219
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:07,160
any on Pat Farrell and path this herb it

220
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:10,100
won't work and the the behavior will be

221
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,510
broke broken there so in order to solve

222
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,260
the presence of the nuts and the

223
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:18,020
firewalls in the path we as shown in the

224
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,120
figure below the we need something to

225
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,040
you to to be to fly out from the client

226
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,920
to the server first and then the server

227
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,510
will make you this warm net entry and

228
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,930
the firewall entry so that it can send

229
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,000
the Herbert so we need first something

230
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,670
to be to be sent by the client and then

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,280
the server to make use of this of this

232
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,130
of this entry but then the question

233
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,140
became is that if the client is said in

234
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,000
the Herbert's so why should the server

235
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,339
continues the sent to send the herb it's

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,140
in in its turn so this is something that

237
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,920
we are explained right now in the in the

238
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:57,020
next slide please

239
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:59,300
Frank so now the the importance of the

240
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,930
of maintaining both the client and the

241
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,510
the server the server herb it is that we

242
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,609
have one particular case in the link

243
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,220
which is which is connecting the the DOS

244
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:12,889
client domain tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu to the

245
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,020
AppStore network so if the clients

246
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,600
his country is sending the her boots and

247
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,300
there is enough to go in attack the the

248
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,219
attack will will saturate the link which

249
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,050
the incoming link to death this client

250
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,610
which means that the client will succeed

251
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,740
the sent to send via the her base

252
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:30,889
request to the server but the server

253
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:33,290
cannot receive any reply from the client

254
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,910
so if the server is receiving the her

255
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,330
boots for the client but it does not

256
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:40,580
receive the response to its own her

257
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,500
boots so this is a clear indication to

258
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,320
the server that there is an attack which

259
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,500
is ongoing and and which is saturating

260
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,450
the link to to to let's client or if the

261
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,070
if there is already mitigation which is

262
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,270
received from the client that this is an

263
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,409
indication that the the actual

264
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,780
mitigation which is put in place is not

265
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,490
effective and the server will use this

266
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:08,350
information to adjust its behavior and

267
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:10,940
also as we show in the next slide

268
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,250
there's also this extreme case or not

269
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,460
extreme case but another case that if

270
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,260
the the client find the Cindy if fails

271
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,960
to send the her bits to the server and

272
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,490
the server cannot receive any her base

273
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,350
from the client but it does not in

274
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,170
addition to that does not receive in a

275
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,179
reply for for its own hurwitz and it

276
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:32,980
does not receive any traffic from the

277
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:35,390
client here the server can just

278
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,620
initialize the automatic mitigation if

279
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,040
this is something which is agreed

280
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,290
between the client and the server so as

281
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,180
shown there there is the the the design

282
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,310
which was adopted by the worker who is

283
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,350
really something which which is aligned

284
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,790
with the the requirement we have and

285
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,560
this is why we need to have both

286
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,680
directions for the hibbett from the

287
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,800
client and for the server next slide

288
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,800
please

289
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,689
and we we also have a we have an

290
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,180
additional requirement for for for in

291
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,430
India for the signal channel is that it

292
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,260
depends on the on the time on which we

293
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,160
are we are maintaining the decision

294
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,530
between the client and the server

295
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,900
whether we have an active mitigation or

296
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:18,800
we are in another I add a at the time

297
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,260
the the agent may decide to adjust the

298
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,139
frequency of their of their her bits

299
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,390
wishes that they are they are sending

300
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,930
the they may decide even to

301
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:32,090
- to disable the mechanism when there is

302
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,770
no attack and just to to run it winter

303
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,020
is attack so this is really something

304
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,550
which is which is configurable and

305
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,129
something which can be negotiated

306
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,560
between the client and the server and in

307
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:45,050
this specification the agents themselves

308
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,940
the managed automatically have you can

309
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:52,520
switch from one configuration to another

310
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:53,210
one based on the attack conditions next

311
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,560
slide please

312
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:59,270
I made yes this is Benedict I'm sorry

313
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,220
the you know sort of cut you off I just

314
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,139
I don't know if we need to go through

315
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,210
all of the slides for the entire room

316
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,860
you know are they more intended for like

317
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,900
Mary and me than the working group

318
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:15,229
directly actually it's it's they tend to

319
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,900
clarify the I would say the concern for

320
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:21,200
from area but we wanted also to to make

321
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,990
sure that the working group there is no

322
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,370
change I would say in the assessment of

323
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,200
the working of about the intense

324
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,120
functionality and the way we are

325
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,530
currently and we say handling the

326
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:39,500
Deaconess point very good point please

327
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:41,090
keep going okay thanks so once we go

328
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,640
back we have multiple parameters that

329
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,439
are falling under each container of the

330
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,530
I would say on the on the configuration

331
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,570
we have the usual co-op transmission

332
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,860
parameters and the do two additional

333
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:56,419
ones that we are introducing for the

334
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,540
sake of the Dutch mechanisms next slide

335
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,540
please

336
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:05,180
so this slide pattern we introduced it

337
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,070
on purpose to to address one of the

338
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,990
would say one of the comments from

339
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,179
Valerie war zone on the list but also

340
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,160
about the piece in that comment that was

341
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,390
raised by baby and also is that this is

342
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,110
something else is configurable you can

343
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:21,110
decide just to set furnaces and miss the

344
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,149
Machine herb is set to for instance the

345
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,610
value of five and a max for transmitted

346
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,560
of three so if there is no loss the the

347
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,600
herb it's would just be exchanged

348
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,899
periodically but if there is an a loss

349
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,840
as it can be shown in the next slide we

350
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,120
will have this this back off and that

351
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,980
will be used between between two two to

352
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,350
her bits and

353
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,330
the same if there is no reply for from

354
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,219
from the pier at this agent so there

355
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,250
will be a transmission that will be a

356
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,049
giggle bhisma time out that the time out

357
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,809
will be doubled each time there is a

358
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:57,889
failure to receive the receive via the

359
00:21:53,809 --> 00:22:02,870
reply to attitude to the higher bids so

360
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:05,840
and this will take at most 45 seconds

361
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,520
and if there is if the we have also in

362
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,309
the specification said that we can not

363
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:15,470
say send multiple her bits request if we

364
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,360
are waiting for another service which we

365
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,610
for which we did interest in a reply and

366
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,229
in the next slide we will show also this

367
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,610
is something which is really flexible so

368
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,010
that you can set for instance the max

369
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,559
returns me to 1 but you increase the

370
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,049
value of your machine her bits so that

371
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,750
you can you can have a periodicity which

372
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,549
is I would say you will have more

373
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,410
frequent her bits to be to be sent

374
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:38,510
compared to the previous schema so it's

375
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,120
it's really deployment specific and the

376
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,980
next slide please

377
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,860
this one is an example in which we can

378
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,500
play we can tweak multiple I would say

379
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,899
transmission parameters because we want

380
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,510
to obtain to optimize the number of the

381
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:58,330
Herbie's that will be exchanged during a

382
00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:01,340
given time times next slide please

383
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,850
so we introduced this this modification

384
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,559
into the latest version of the we say DD

385
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,780
signalization a specification just to

386
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,580
make it clear that we are flexible in

387
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,470
term in term of I would say ah coffee

388
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,960
and this is not something which is

389
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,150
really frozen it's up of the dose agent

390
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,410
to negotiate the appropriate

391
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,179
configuration that will be followed

392
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,660
during the mitigation time and also the

393
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:25,700
the idea thing we are accumulating

394
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,040
though the periodic one and also the one

395
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:31,419
in which we will send most frequent

396
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,970
keepalive requests next slide please

397
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:38,720
and then we come to this to this

398
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:40,970
tutorial transport so when we are when

399
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,390
we fail the dots agent fail to establish

400
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,940
the does a connection using the using a

401
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:50,360
detail s value and UDP so there's a

402
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,539
fallback to to use a TLS and in in that

403
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,219
in that case all the the return

404
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:57,919
mission parameters does not apply by a

405
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,200
default so next slide please

406
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,899
we introduced this new a clarification

407
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,399
to the text as a ProQuest by a comment

408
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,258
that we received from Valerie so for us

409
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:08,209
we are not this is not a change a big

410
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:09,559
change into Dudy specification we are

411
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,379
just echoing what we have in the

412
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:14,600
existing RFC's but in case there is

413
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:16,519
there are miss confusion or

414
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,238
misinterpretation of the text we are we

415
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:21,710
are with this new text suggested by as a

416
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:23,659
to reply to one of the chemists we see

417
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,879
from from Valerie we make sure that we

418
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:29,179
have explicit text that this does not

419
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:30,549
appliance for for TCP so you can next

420
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:38,960
slide please

421
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:40,999
next one next one so this is this is one

422
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,830
of the core I would say discussion point

423
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:45,200
with the Maria is with all we need to

424
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,330
use the the current coop existing

425
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,820
messages to do the herbage functionality

426
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:52,460
or we need to redefine a new one that

427
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,139
will be specific to do this so in the

428
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,450
current design we are just using ping

429
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:59,299
ping pong for win TCP is used and the de

430
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:05,210
coop the coop request for for the UDP

431
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:07,429
next slide please so when we declare

432
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,889
failure so for for the winner we are

433
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,929
using tennis for instance this is

434
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:15,949
something that is really an under the

435
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:18,609
full control of the decision its it will

436
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:22,539
it will rely on the timeout of the punk

437
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:25,609
so which is which is a completely

438
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,190
configured by the by the agent itself

439
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:30,049
and it's completely up to this

440
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,239
application to decide whether it has to

441
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:35,869
give up give up or it has to continue to

442
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:37,629
wait for a signal from the peer next one

443
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:40,759
please

444
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:42,439
so this is for this is for EDP for Yuki

445
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,599
we are just relying on various

446
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,179
parameters the Machine heard bit aloud

447
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,220
but also about on on the ongoing attack

448
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:53,149
attack mitigation and then the server

449
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:55,249
based on various are of this on the on

450
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:57,139
the screen 3 it can decide whether the

451
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:59,659
connection is disconnected or not and

452
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:04,099
also the client it will decide when it

453
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:07,070
has to to to to to do resumption or or

454
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:09,919
or not next slide please

455
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,939
so Maria is currently a suggestion that

456
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,920
we instead of using the confirmable

457
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,740
messages to do the her bits we should

458
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,690
investigate the the use of non

459
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,960
confirmable messages to do the

460
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:28,640
dysfunctionality so this will bring us

461
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,950
to the next slide please so if you want

462
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,050
to use non confirmable message to do the

463
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,240
the herbert fox 84 the does that that

464
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,889
means that for the client-side is no

465
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,260
problem because it's something that we

466
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,510
can we can we have we we don't defend

467
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,370
various way to do that but the problem

468
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,930
is mainly on the server side so that's

469
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,379
mean that the the bitch server has to

470
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:50,660
send non confirmable messages so but we

471
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,180
in all two that we have just recall some

472
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,890
some basic that we have in RFC and 72-52

473
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,260
is that a client is is basically

474
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,150
something an entity which sent request

475
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,310
and the server is an Oct wish to receive

476
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,530
requests and the only type message

477
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,090
tablet can be exchanged and which is

478
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,060
just neither a request and the response

479
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:10,790
is an empty message so if you want the

480
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,310
server to initiate the Herbert's message

481
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:16,639
message this mission need to be empty

482
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,950
empty ones but the questions there is is

483
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,220
it possible that the server can send on

484
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:25,670
empty non confirmable message so as we

485
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:29,240
can see in the next slide again if we go

486
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:31,340
back to our C 72-52 with its explicitly

487
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,010
say that and non confirmable message

488
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,990
must not be empty so we are just looking

489
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,590
here and the this alternative approach

490
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:41,870
does not work because otherwise is the

491
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,610
only way it will works is that we have

492
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,929
to send

493
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,870
confirmable empty messages that we are

494
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,960
doing anyway with the ducroix proquest

495
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,300
next slide please

496
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,730
so this brings me to I will say to the

497
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:58,370
main slide of this presentation is that

498
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,830
we are just here repeating what we that

499
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:04,280
the intended functionality we wanted for

500
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,439
the habit functionality we just verified

501
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,660
that why there is no alternative

502
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,120
approach and if we want to do another

503
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:19,140
approach it will be very less the the

504
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:22,229
RFC 72 50 52 and from from

505
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:25,910
taken into account this consideration we

506
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:27,960
would like to have I would say a

507
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,490
follow-up from the I would say the

508
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,040
working group the idiots and the chairs

509
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,660
so how to report back to Maria about

510
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:43,860
this at this point so that we can we can

511
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:46,860
we can move on thanks men

512
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:49,559
this is been here again yeah I think

513
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,370
this is actually quite helpful to see

514
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,080
all this I think you even coming into

515
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,500
this week we had very good understanding

516
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,159
for what the case is when we're on

517
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,049
reliable transport and so at least for

518
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,970
me in particular I was just getting a

519
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:08,850
good better understanding of the case

520
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:12,690
with the unreliable transport so the UDP

521
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:16,320
DTLS and I did get to talk to Maria

522
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,660
earlier in the week and I think that you

523
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,570
know mostly she just wanted to make sure

524
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,220
that we were designing something that

525
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,928
you know met the needs that we had and

526
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,030
not just doing something convenient and

527
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:29,640
so I think it's really good to hear that

528
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,110
you know we've thought about yes we do

529
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,330
definitely need to have signals

530
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:36,270
initiated from the client and signals

531
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:39,899
initiated from the server it sort of

532
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,760
sounds like you know we are we have a

533
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,160
less compelling need to get your

534
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,720
specific responses or acts to the

535
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,730
individual heartbeats in each direction

536
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,520
but we definitely need messages

537
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:52,380
initiated in each direction and you know

538
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,840
given that we know that we can then go

539
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,940
forward and say okay co-op doesn't

540
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:02,159
actually let us send the messages from

541
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:04,309
the server that are not confirmable so

542
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,260
you know that sort of forces our hand

543
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:13,200
especially because we also doesn't let

544
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:15,840
us send you know the other requests from

545
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,530
the server and so I think that we've

546
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,820
done the analysis that we need to do to

547
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,220
confirm that the design we ended up at

548
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,409
is in fact the only design that actually

549
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,240
works for this so I think you should be

550
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,179
pretty straightforward to have another

551
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,580
conversation with Maria and get the

552
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,019
discuss point resolved so I

553
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,389
happy trying you find her this week

554
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,760
increase in and do the explanation or if

555
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,440
you think we just should send her the

556
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:46,799
slide deck and a little bit of an email

557
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:48,659
we could do that as well take it from

558
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,289
its yeah it's up to you it's up to you

559
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:54,480
to I would prefer if if if one if the

560
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:55,890
chairs or you can can I would say take

561
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,880
over for this for this point because

562
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,890
yeah I have explained and we'd say many

563
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,600
times to to myriad all this I would say

564
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,159
the the issues on the design the

565
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,959
intended design and so on so I would

566
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:11,700
like that at this time to hand over this

567
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,070
to you to you or the chairs so that you

568
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,289
can resolve the deal to explain a little

569
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,879
bit the outcome of the would say of the

570
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:21,120
of the of the discussion we had in the

571
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,440
working group yeah definitely I'm happy

572
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,989
to be like you because of the this

573
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,490
session dispensations out of transyl

574
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:39,210
must cattle I after the economy and okay

575
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:42,330
the Laster I'm throwing the following

576
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,909
the discussion is amazing me and there's

577
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:48,389
no Egyptian with these assessments thank

578
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:49,860
you so much to our th and made then I

579
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:55,529
need to mention that the

580
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:59,010
interoperability testing cut of UDP

581
00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:02,519
because my side only uses the crops over

582
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:06,149
unity hug I'm wondering if John could

583
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:14,150
give us some assessment about the cop

584
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:16,070
over TCP yeah yes I think it does

585
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,010
suggestion even you can take some post

586
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:23,590
cases and I think that can help us -

587
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,590
okay John is coming with me we can

588
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:31,460
internally within my implementation of

589
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:35,960
things I have done some reasonably

590
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,250
extensive tests of with the TCP and some

591
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,950
heartbeat failures and stuff but it

592
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,830
hasn't been totally rigorous it hasn't

593
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:46,040
been with an intro up with the likes of

594
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:48,429
can amaze godox implementation so it's

595
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:52,520
an area for perhaps further testing but

596
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:55,400
it works but again the the preferred

597
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,780
protocol really is UDP because we have

598
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,440
much better control with we're not

599
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:05,270
reliant on partial link failures traffic

600
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,010
flooding yes thank you Joe and economy

601
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,230
you have done a lot of good work on the

602
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,080
interoperability test and for this

603
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:14,480
typical use you I still encouraging you

604
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,510
both to do more tests because this is

605
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,690
there were some will update from Meg and

606
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:23,960
from single training courses so if you

607
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:27,200
have any good without conclusions please

608
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,560
us send it to email and we can you know

609
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,550
we can get more clear without of this is

610
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:38,629
this problem okay okay sure yes thank

611
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:41,780
you thank you yeah yeah I think you call

612
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:44,810
that um reason I think I will have more

613
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:48,620
on discussion with AD and the core

614
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:49,850
source often so but anyway our for the

615
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:54,760
company then we should have go to the

616
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,760
next presentation so its economy okay

617
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,659
again I mean she's got romantic

618
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:30,969
communication I'd like to present the

619
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:35,919
update of the draft control featuring

620
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:40,299
Ruth you know Charlie in Frank mentioned

621
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:43,480
that this specification in this draft is

622
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:47,970
the outcome of the interrupt testing in

623
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:52,599
the hackathon in don ôt then which

624
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:55,709
enable the control of this a shield of a

625
00:34:52,599 --> 00:35:02,550
signal channel in a tactic priority

626
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:06,520
issues was issues were installed over

627
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:09,339
data channel so it enables the more

628
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:15,550
control on the issue so it has the

629
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:19,000
capability of the dots portable get then

630
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,970
those functions are already tested in

631
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,869
the interrupt testing between high and

632
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:29,680
john then a deductive show the optic

633
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:35,859
changes since we brought since the last

634
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:42,609
IETF block then yep about the existence

635
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:46,540
of the issue attributes and if okay then

636
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:49,890
when tackle it allows the both mutation

637
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:53,200
request with and result issue attribute

638
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:58,118
for the first time which is a request so

639
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:03,460
and also it is clearly noted that it is

640
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:06,070
the new new MIT then are actually

641
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,950
recommendation is to send an official

642
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:13,060
request without a co-author yet

643
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:17,379
first and 10 Center request with the

644
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:20,440
issue for adjusting this code rationale

645
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,140
is to avoid during the

646
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,940
education in an era is in contact due to

647
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:32,799
the ACL processing on the other server

648
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:35,230
but if it off point in a second point we

649
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,970
added more details about the behavior of

650
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:43,270
zatoichi agents if the dot server

651
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:46,180
doesn't find the Asia name included in

652
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:49,839
the mission request from Doc client then

653
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:54,040
replies with folder 2:04 not found error

654
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:57,819
message then if the issue is fun the

655
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:01,599
activation type is updated also you be

656
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:04,109
kept as the last state even after the

657
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:08,380
termination of the initiation request

658
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:14,049
the last time is also updated as if the

659
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:16,359
request was done by each other then if

660
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:20,040
any failure is encountered to impose the

661
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:24,098
Asia update the two-toed server returns

662
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,589
5.03 error code with fail failed Asia

663
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:29,349
updates in the diagnostic

664
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:33,970
payload the internet if specified that a

665
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:39,180
toad client must immediately send a new

666
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:39,180
mediation request result the failed Asia

667
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:49,810
okay then we did operate it to the for

668
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:53,529
the clarification then the drugs

669
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:56,230
currently have the three in some in

670
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:59,109
general when attack evolves its

671
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:02,920
reactivity type may be adjusted by a

672
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:04,900
toad crier for example the activation of

673
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:10,060
us a she

674
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:12,339
Vivian with the new MIT then also this

675
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:15,009
is also for the for the clarification

676
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:18,339
the scenario was operated dot random

677
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:22,450
attack we thought that grant can use the

678
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:25,240
data channel as usual to retrieve TSEs

679
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,578
also this is the photic for the photo

680
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,560
qualification that is he really the

681
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:33,150
actions are done using dot state each

682
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,150
other when the attack

683
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:42,090
that is detective also we operated the

684
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:46,560
security considerations so what next

685
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:49,230
okay let me restart our Godot our

686
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,750
software open software implementation

687
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:56,730
already implemented this function and

688
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:59,670
there is no problem so far so which is

689
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:03,420
that no issue is ending and the contact

690
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,530
is stable so redirect to request but

691
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:13,920
last call here thank you so much

692
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:16,440
any comments or questions as a

693
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,180
contributor I have a question for

694
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:23,820
clarification can you go back to the

695
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:26,339
page to explain why you why you need to

696
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,950
send you know the signaling channel

697
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:37,730
medication request at the first time

698
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:42,540
with no with ACL okay for example the

699
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:50,130
attack is already happened then if lion

700
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:55,920
try to mitigate the attack at the same

701
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:58,160
time in maybe they it want to enable the

702
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:06,000
already installed

703
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:10,350
so we can enable pause issues also Misha

704
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,750
liquid okay okay so so in a previous

705
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:15,390
document you haven't mentioned that is

706
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,410
very Conner case when you send the

707
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:22,859
foster mitigates the request you need to

708
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:25,049
activate your ACL right now right it is

709
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:34,700
a go for this notification

710
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:39,090
yes yeah yeah okay thank you

711
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:43,470
hi this is weapon for heart on can turn

712
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:46,990
to page 3 about the last case if the

713
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:50,529
failure is encountered too

714
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:52,479
enforce the n0 update I mean if you send

715
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:56,910
is a medication request the first a

716
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:01,260
result the ACL and then the medication

717
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:05,020
will be found and then you update to the

718
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:08,440
medication request a with a sale but the

719
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:11,080
ACL failed the last descendants I I

720
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,470
think maybe not we when you don't need

721
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:17,500
to update the request medication request

722
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:22,709
with the fail without at the fair ratio

723
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:28,240
I think this is not necessary okay yep

724
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:33,490
goodbye so this means that the each year

725
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:37,720
you could include the conflict may be

726
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:43,419
conflict with the other situation so in

727
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:46,990
order to continue the historic other

728
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:53,680
issues then it should drop the field

729
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:56,709
issue I mean I meaning here that the ACL

730
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,440
is a fair but the medication can be done

731
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:02,230
without this Sao the top server can do

732
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,120
the medication just went away went

733
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:09,940
process failed ACO it see always fair I

734
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,710
omit the Sao I can do other things you

735
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,380
with the left west the scenes so that

736
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:16,300
was crying so if you send a new

737
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:20,950
medication request adjust without other

738
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:27,270
failed i sell its you don't have no new

739
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:31,770
things will happen industry that thought

740
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:36,430
crier think that the situation is not

741
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:41,380
sufficient so it tried to install the

742
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:46,149
asia or deactivate the asia on the other

743
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:49,000
side so the dots glad easy take it is

744
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:53,590
intended that that grabs try to stop the

745
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:58,470
asia so if the error code was written

746
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:59,950
then docked cry and Caffey change the

747
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:06,480
check

748
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:10,210
Asia then it will it may or may not

749
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,340
installed a new ACL yeah I know that if

750
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,250
you if you if the best client will

751
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:18,640
realize that the one I previous end is

752
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:21,700
wrong and it felt that it can't do the

753
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:26,589
update about it with the new one but if

754
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:31,060
it I mean the new one is not really

755
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:37,840
necessary if it's a doesn't one can fix

756
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:41,590
the promise tape I mean okay yeah

757
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:44,110
the must seems to streak for that case

758
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:46,450
so yeah yeah it must is okay but you

759
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,390
needed to master

760
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:52,870
maybe not yeah I mean stand a new

761
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:55,240
medical condition if we saw so many

762
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:59,650
detail can we go on to that mainly

763
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:05,799
discussions ok enough but there are one

764
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:08,020
more comment from the online yes so this

765
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,240
is just I replied to to the comments

766
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,790
from from me right yeah he's right about

767
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,259
about his observations so actually what

768
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,750
we are doing is that this is this this

769
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:19,270
immediate new mitigation is only when

770
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:22,000
when the the ACL is sent in the first

771
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:24,730
mitigation request or in a mitigation we

772
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,250
did not just adjust its mitigation scope

773
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:29,110
so the text is already and I would say

774
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,270
cover and cover in this case we are not

775
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:33,640
sending immediately a new request when

776
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:36,460
there's a failure of the of the if the

777
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,759
request in including the ACL it's only

778
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:42,040
for the first one and if if the initial

779
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,670
request includes the ACL attributes or

780
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:50,070
if the the mitigation include includes a

781
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:50,070
new adjusted mitigation scope

782
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:04,809
okay so at the trail we think that this

783
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:09,459
document has already yeah we have a set

784
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:12,339
discussed the several runs in and it's

785
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:16,989
true it's working to make sure stable

786
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:19,779
now so so if you know any objects may be

787
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:21,519
weak I think we will consider erasing

788
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:25,209
the working group last call on the main

789
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:31,058
list and anybody can come in and work it

790
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:43,060
will feedback on this okay okay thank

791
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:47,140
you I the world

792
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:50,290
you know go home in Canada hi this is

793
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,569
one from our um I prevent they strapped

794
00:45:50,290 --> 00:46:00,009
on behalf of the ulcers because they are

795
00:45:52,570 --> 00:46:03,610
not coming today the update since the

796
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:06,910
product about the co home draft first in

797
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:10,570
the scope the co home functionality is

798
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:14,379
not specific to home networks so in this

799
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:17,380
new version it was be clearly graphic

800
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:19,990
clarified that it applies each time

801
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,630
there is a need to filter an attack near

802
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:26,709
the sources like if you were be used for

803
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:32,410
day centers and prices text has been

804
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:36,250
added about the post extensions in the

805
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:39,310
draft it defined the three new

806
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,950
attributes that the source prefix source

807
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:45,130
port range and the source ICMP type

808
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:47,649
range these attributes are can be used

809
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:52,060
in the bass signal channel even if

810
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:56,380
they're the Kohanim functionality is not

811
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:58,690
enabled it's often it's the three

812
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:02,560
attributes are optional for the bass

813
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:05,170
thoughts back and when used in the coho

814
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,110
functionality come home scenario the

815
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:12,480
source prefix is a mandatory attribute

816
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:16,600
and that this is be cleared in the draft

817
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,870
about that the next activity is about a

818
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:22,420
dedicated heartbeat to mechanism on the

819
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:24,490
toad client retrieved the session

820
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,980
configuration parameters from the toast

821
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,839
servers the toe server had adjusted the

822
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:32,020
heartbeat interval to accommodate

823
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,980
binding timers used by on past Nats and

824
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,100
firewalls

825
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:40,930
the toast client sends a heartbeat

826
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:43,470
immediately after the receipt of over

827
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:47,430
the message from the post server to

828
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:53,020
refresh the net and or fire warm happens

829
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:57,879
if the toast client detect and outgoing

830
00:47:53,020 --> 00:48:00,220
attacked if if an out going attack

831
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,079
satirist the link from dots over to

832
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,689
Todd's client and a little client

833
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,420
realized that detected

834
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,359
so those client must have continued to

835
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,250
use the signal channel even if no

836
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:15,790
traffic is received the phone's appeared

837
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:18,820
because it's been saturated so the

838
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:21,390
totals message you may not be me can't

839
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:25,150
be conveyed

840
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:27,160
if the server receives traffic from the

841
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,349
DOS client the thought server must

842
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,379
continue to use a signal channel even if

843
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:35,349
the missing heartbeat allow allow the

844
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,030
threshold is reached if the toaster

845
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:39,910
earth does not to receive any traffic

846
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:43,510
from the peer client including the

847
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:46,089
replies to its heartbeats and that all

848
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:50,050
server must try to resume the detail

849
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:52,960
session not to not preserve details

850
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:54,609
client because the details initiation is

851
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:01,150
reserved in the columns in a new

852
00:48:54,609 --> 00:49:03,240
scenario next update is a as a

853
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:06,880
contributor a question for clarification

854
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,709
yeah and yeah this dedicated heartbeat

855
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,270
in Canyon for the go home

856
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:16,109
singing on trend or is it a different

857
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:19,630
order while all totally same with

858
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:23,230
basically no China hot bikini Canada um

859
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:25,770
it's not really totally different or

860
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:31,750
totally the same it's some changes

861
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:36,640
because the because what role is changed

862
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:41,589
in the patrol of the dts row is reversed

863
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,598
in this in this chance and in the bass

864
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:47,259
signal channel the mechanical heart

865
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,780
eater in that how do you say that

866
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,530
because of the row change so they

867
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:56,500
initiated the process for the toast

868
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:01,150
server in the bass signal channel in

869
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:03,960
suit for the toast client in the Kohala

870
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:08,230
scenario but but in from

871
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:11,619
direction the other part for the process

872
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:16,230
I think should it be similar she'll be

873
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:26,619
no difference I think though but maybe

874
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:37,259
merit if you my opinion yes yeah okay

875
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:37,259
Matt what's he also do you can't

876
00:50:49,380 --> 00:51:02,280
hey Frank still here hello hi hi Mel

877
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:20,380
hello can you hear me not very clear

878
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:24,130
Oh Chester we leave this on your list

879
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:26,350
okay okay okay

880
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:28,780
the next update is a request a

881
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:32,730
validation only immediately me

882
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:37,660
medication requests are allowed because

883
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:40,420
if you it's not reasonable for the dogs

884
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:42,399
crying to do send the medication

885
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:46,210
requested with the trigger medication

886
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,090
set to force and it's adjust our incase

887
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:51,580
situation for the bass signal channel

888
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:53,470
and for the co home scenario that was

889
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:57,240
crying that was crying the sends a

890
00:51:53,470 --> 00:52:00,910
mitigation must be under the attack

891
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:06,029
during the attack time so so the trigger

892
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:09,940
mitigation I can't be sent to force and

893
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:12,310
the prefix must be validated such

894
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:15,630
critics must be within the scope of the

895
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:19,360
thoughts server domain and by default

896
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:23,830
the dose grind a little server need to

897
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:28,510
validate as a tacit target the prefix is

898
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:32,740
only those climbers scope so the by

899
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:35,230
default on an irritable prefix included

900
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:41,109
in the target prefix is considered at in

901
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:44,800
within the scope of those client some

902
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:47,650
other miscellaneous first is add some

903
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,520
tags about the triggers at the toes

904
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:53,270
crime that you initiate go home

905
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,170
Quest's and the second is at an appendix

906
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:59,000
to record the design rationale about

907
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:01,580
this advocating the basic no channel

908
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,530
bill versus Co homes in our signal

909
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:08,360
channel the third is about to

910
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:12,310
restructure the Nazi gene text so for

911
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:15,890
the next there's no issue is pending and

912
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:23,710
the the authors are want to requested

913
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:26,299
that okay go blast call wishing that

914
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:30,740
little bit bullish using it for the

915
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:33,080
draft first of all I think that the

916
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:37,640
terminology use is a bit confusion

917
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:41,029
because in classic dates we have those

918
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:45,830
servers it is in upstream provider and

919
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:48,110
the bitch client in your network and you

920
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:50,630
know home case you use the same

921
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:54,310
terminology but essentially the server

922
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:56,990
is in a home network and client is a

923
00:53:54,310 --> 00:54:00,820
upstream providers it is a bit confusion

924
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:05,540
for the readers probably we need to

925
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:09,590
invent new names to clearly distinguish

926
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:13,820
this case because classic dots crime can

927
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:17,390
be collocated to his come home survey up

928
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:19,820
so so I think a few more polishing is

929
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:23,330
needed just for document to be more

930
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:28,190
readable and understandable for dentists

931
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:34,130
yeah I think this can be discussed with

932
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:36,410
the author's the Marianist kamischka I

933
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:46,670
have the questions about the validations

934
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:47,660
line which one yep okay now this confirm

935
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:50,510
includes

936
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:53,649
two functionalities I think first one

937
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:56,570
it's a role reversal of

938
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:59,390
TTS layer and dirty thought mechanism

939
00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:02,910
and this can't one needs a expansion of

940
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:08,720
source related information right then

941
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:12,299
I do agree the reversal of TDS is we cut

942
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,700
especially if the doctor server is

943
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:18,680
behind the knot

944
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:21,960
however the thief don't go home

945
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:26,399
Felicia is not specific to the home

946
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:30,359
network so it can be used in the maybe

947
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:34,380
in the provider network I think so I see

948
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:38,098
it also making the same use cases then

949
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:42,509
however in the variation it's only says

950
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:46,680
it should sauce prefixes should be

951
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:50,190
belong to belonged to the dot server

952
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:54,779
domain however in the providers use

953
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:57,869
cases in the dot Sabah could be closer

954
00:55:54,779 --> 00:56:02,329
to the source however it not necessary

955
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:06,809
to the closest yep I got your point yeah

956
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:11,460
that III think that the source prefix

957
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:14,430
validation is a mandatory condition for

958
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:18,000
the list here for the co home scenario

959
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:20,910
and for the base signal Channel and this

960
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,940
can be considered because of that you

961
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:27,538
haze on situation listed there I I think

962
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:34,019
that can be considered later yep I think

963
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:36,900
that is the point okay chicken I'm just

964
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:41,279
a question about the cherry agreed not

965
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:45,769
Casey so if there is a talk from behind

966
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:49,259
the carrier great not then the attack

967
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:51,240
need to be mapped from the external

968
00:56:49,259 --> 00:56:54,809
address to the internal IP address

969
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:58,859
however how dot cria

970
00:56:54,809 --> 00:57:04,140
know that the attack sauce is belonging

971
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:09,779
to reach dot server yeah a circular

972
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:13,910
question in the in now in the co home

973
00:57:09,779 --> 00:57:16,900
draft in the discussed as a situations

974
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:41,410
but the details I think may be met

975
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:45,309
well to some clarification yes olfaction

976
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:50,558
is able to to near a Texas medication

977
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:55,180
and I notice that most cars as you know

978
00:57:50,559 --> 00:58:00,029
is home network news co-holder sauce

979
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:03,308
prefix is mandatory pathos attack

980
00:58:00,029 --> 00:58:05,920
tribute attack so I think those might

981
00:58:03,309 --> 00:58:08,849
have to send many medication first to

982
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,910
the server each dose therapy to

983
00:58:08,849 --> 00:58:18,009
different homework as mean that when

984
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:25,180
does attack occurs trying to have two

985
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:33,069
and many parties to a server it is it

986
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:37,899
not a DOS attack all right

987
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:45,450
I didn't catch your point I mean that

988
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:50,190
those prefix is hard to agree t told

989
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:54,328
they have demanding those IP and the

990
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:57,519
estas ipm8 equal to different that

991
00:58:54,329 --> 00:59:00,940
different homework so the medication

992
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:07,238
recurs to have 2% with your friend or

993
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:15,369
server I suggest that we can discuss in

994
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:18,940
the melanistic I think we have such a

995
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:20,400
discussion before okay next

996
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:35,019
[Music]

997
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:37,059
yes me trying to answer the first

998
00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:40,569
comment from from from Konami yes I

999
00:59:37,059 --> 00:59:42,579
think that's yeah we the decision is on

1000
00:59:40,569 --> 00:59:46,299
is on the I would say on the or the

1001
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:48,069
network side the and the the client is

1002
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:50,200
also on the network side we have

1003
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:55,660
specified in the in the in the document

1004
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:57,879
how the how it can access to the mapping

1005
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:01,058
which is which are provided by the way

1006
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:03,160
decision so that it can correlate the

1007
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:05,499
external IP address and the internal one

1008
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,328
and this information can help

1009
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:10,149
dd-does client to it'll define the

1010
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:12,190
appropriate that server and then to to

1011
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,650
supply the appropriate information to to

1012
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:18,130
the appropriate server so that it can

1013
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:20,349
block the attack source which is located

1014
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:22,599
in its domain so we have some discussion

1015
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:24,160
in the in the document to to provide not

1016
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:26,079
the recommendation on how to do that but

1017
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,210
all but all but only to provide some

1018
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,299
examples when how this interface can be

1019
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:34,269
implemented at address client for the

1020
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:36,160
validation of the search prefix we what

1021
01:00:34,269 --> 01:00:39,279
we need is that when there is a client

1022
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,019
which is contacting a dot server which

1023
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:42,999
which claiming that there is an attack

1024
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:46,660
which is coming from that network when

1025
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:50,288
the the DOS client must make sure that

1026
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:52,029
the prefix which is which is which is

1027
01:00:50,289 --> 01:00:54,670
claimed to be a source of attack it

1028
01:00:52,029 --> 01:00:57,069
belongs to the domain which is managed

1029
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:59,529
by that dot server so if you don't have

1030
01:00:57,069 --> 01:01:02,019
this validation we will end up with

1031
01:00:59,529 --> 01:01:05,109
something which as we are just sending I

1032
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:07,508
would say some request to some good

1033
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:10,808
servers who does not have any I would

1034
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:12,819
say control on the we're not gonna give

1035
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:16,180
an IP prefix so that's why this

1036
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:19,210
validation is required for the go home

1037
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,828
functionality but when it comes that we

1038
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:23,739
we will send or we will supply the

1039
01:01:20,829 --> 01:01:29,710
search traffic as as as part of the I

1040
01:01:23,739 --> 01:01:34,289
would say the classic the classic signal

1041
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:34,289
channel we don't have this kind of very

1042
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:50,289
economy you are the still the same youth

1043
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:55,240
on you your comments so please clarify

1044
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:58,680
that in you know they stood chicken are

1045
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:01,390
cases then the validation may be

1046
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:04,779
different from the coal home is Casey

1047
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:09,160
so in this draft it is not clear so it

1048
01:02:04,779 --> 01:02:13,779
it seems it will be applied to the every

1049
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:16,029
Casey okay that's typical communist and

1050
01:02:13,779 --> 01:02:20,529
maybe we will update the document to

1051
01:02:16,029 --> 01:02:25,599
clarify some more ok next door president

1052
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:31,470
I think it should be mad about the store

1053
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:31,470
discovery manager

1054
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:55,099
you are you yes I already supplying the

1055
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:55,098
slides yeah you can you can start

1056
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:15,649
okay thank you Friday okay so this is

1057
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:18,140
this is an update of the the dots

1058
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:22,070
discovery discovery draft so next slide

1059
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:23,660
please so this is an update of the I

1060
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:26,900
would say what happened recently on the

1061
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:28,940
the base specification and base

1062
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,770
specification I meant the dot signal

1063
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,140
channel so this is something we have we

1064
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:35,690
have added to to the specification as

1065
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:38,930
part of the I would say of the ICO

1066
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:40,540
review and especially as part of the

1067
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:43,609
discussion about the default port number

1068
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:47,090
number which is required for the signal

1069
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:48,740
channel so in order to simplify the

1070
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:51,440
deployment of the dost client within

1071
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:55,359
home networks and also within entreprise

1072
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:58,400
networks we added an extra I would say

1073
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:00,530
line into the discovery of the of the

1074
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,070
death server saying that if there is no

1075
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:05,900
explicit list of ipv4 or ipv6 addresses

1076
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:08,150
to contact the dead server that are

1077
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:10,070
provided to this client the deaths

1078
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:13,160
client will try with the default home

1079
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:14,900
gateway the default gateway whether it

1080
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:18,200
in bits at the server or rather to

1081
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:21,050
gateways so the the the main rationale

1082
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:25,730
for that to simplify the deployment on

1083
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:28,670
such network configuration without

1084
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:31,340
requiring any software modification not

1085
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:33,410
build the the hot side and also the CPS

1086
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:35,210
side so that it can support this kind of

1087
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:37,160
discovery which can be a barrier for it

1088
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:45,830
for for this typical deployments

1089
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:48,649
next slide please so we we have

1090
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:50,630
implemented various various changes into

1091
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,520
into the draft so in the first version

1092
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:57,230
that was published was right after the

1093
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:59,360
the pragma team so we shortened the list

1094
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:01,820
of the the discovery mechanisms that are

1095
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,400
supported in the in the draft

1096
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:06,260
so this to align to to be aligned with

1097
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,480
the outcome of the of the pragmatic we

1098
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:10,400
have and also we included some figures

1099
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,040
for executed in the discovery procedure

1100
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,680
for instance if there is a an expiry of

1101
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,529
the I would say the certificate we learn

1102
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,810
on your network

1103
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:21,330
so also that we will run again DT

1104
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:23,279
discovery mechanism so that we can learn

1105
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:26,430
the appropriate date server to be used

1106
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,380
for a given interface as part on and

1107
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:33,569
then in the next in the next version the

1108
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:36,090
o2 we have sent a request to to DG

1109
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:38,700
working group so that we can ask for a

1110
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:41,940
formal review from them so we received a

1111
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:44,640
review from from burning so and the

1112
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,500
there was no technical issue about the

1113
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,420
specification there is also some with

1114
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,890
same manner edits that we have

1115
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,540
implemented in lab so this is something

1116
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:54,120
which is really a good signal to see

1117
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:55,680
this yeah the the current ditch DHCP

1118
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:58,259
specification we have on the discovery

1119
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,299
is really working and there is no issue

1120
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:03,680
with it from the DHT working about

1121
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:06,980
perspective next slide please

1122
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,839
and in the third version we updated the

1123
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:13,200
discovery to take into account the

1124
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:15,540
specifics of the Cole home context so we

1125
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,430
we are we went for a design which is

1126
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,650
really pragmatic that's means we are not

1127
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:21,540
required to define another new day chip

1128
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:24,300
option for that we are just using the

1129
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:27,779
same the DHCP option for both the the

1130
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:30,030
Cole home but also the base signal

1131
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,100
channel and we introduced a dedicated

1132
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:34,380
service name for for the Cole home

1133
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:36,569
itself with the I would say the

1134
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:38,880
appropriate text to clarify how this can

1135
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:41,610
this can be used and the the latest

1136
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,230
version it was the offer this one was

1137
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:46,980
mainly to to address some common that

1138
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:49,170
were raised by by Frank so up to date so

1139
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,120
we don't have any pending issue on this

1140
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:53,190
on the specification and all of the

1141
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:56,700
commands that we received from from from

1142
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:59,690
the idea group were implemented on the

1143
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:03,390
under latest version next slide please

1144
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:04,740
so this is why we do think that we are

1145
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:12,000
ready for our working group last call

1146
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:15,120
and the floor is yours the chairs think

1147
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,110
that the draft needs a little bit

1148
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:22,740
polishing especially for using normative

1149
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:25,440
language in selection discovery method

1150
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:28,879
it is not we're not happy with this

1151
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:31,309
because for example you

1152
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,309
it is written that you should support

1153
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:38,839
both your method and the shoot is very

1154
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:41,660
close to mast and no no text is given

1155
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:45,200
when it is acceptable not to support

1156
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:50,239
some of the methods and I think this

1157
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:56,899
part of the draft need to be it'll be

1158
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:58,700
polished yes so please if you have any a

1159
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,069
proposal on this I would say on this

1160
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:04,640
text publishing so please send on the

1161
01:08:01,069 --> 01:08:05,239
list okay okay I think we'll discuss it

1162
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,489
on the list

1163
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,759
I'll send the proposal okay thank you

1164
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:09,759
okay

1165
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:17,540
thank you mate I think let's finish this

1166
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:23,809
presentation and let's go to a second

1167
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:27,019
next one next one is you hate the way

1168
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:29,960
where you use case operators so use

1169
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:34,239
cases for how to use a thoughts protocol

1170
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:38,779
for his for his specific deployment okay

1171
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:41,959
thank you I mean hi she from Maine Kiki

1172
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:46,420
there's also DDoS nutrition fraud

1173
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,420
thoughts applicability on deployment

1174
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:59,619
this is a distance-r sender agenda first

1175
01:08:56,299 --> 01:09:03,589
of all I want to explain all of my draft

1176
01:08:59,618 --> 01:09:05,719
the goal of my draft is to exemplify the

1177
01:09:03,589 --> 01:09:08,719
use of dots in to cut deployment

1178
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:11,689
contests and I want to assess to what

1179
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,880
extent current dot specification can be

1180
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:16,580
applied in particular deployment contest

1181
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:19,099
and whether there are boats I heard

1182
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:25,549
their voice our feedback and update dot

1183
01:09:19,099 --> 01:09:27,830
specification this is the summary of the

1184
01:09:25,549 --> 01:09:30,560
image of rod scenario our returning my

1185
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:33,559
draft in the scenario adults whose

1186
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,810
utilization rate is high and since it's

1187
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,150
Brock traffic information to orchestrate

1188
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:40,460
our using dot protocol but then the

1189
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:42,719
orchestrator case wadi node such as

1190
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:46,349
brutal to filter the trophy trophy

1191
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:49,290
to off-road DMS as a scenario is divided

1192
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:52,560
into two case in bundling case on auto

1193
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:55,739
bundling case I left one eats at the

1194
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:58,230
signal between DMS and Orchestrator is

1195
01:09:55,739 --> 01:10:01,739
combated via inbound link on the other

1196
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:07,348
hand a light one is a signal is

1197
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:09,718
completed via Autobot ink then I explain

1198
01:10:07,349 --> 01:10:14,190
technical contribution all my draft to

1199
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:17,130
working group one is that I improved it

1200
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:20,730
also gives duration usages working group

1201
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:23,579
draft the other one is that I check dots

1202
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:26,610
applicability on Scrubs describe a

1203
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:31,049
deployment consideration on my DMS of

1204
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:34,139
Road scenario this is about improvement

1205
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:38,250
or video so case ratio use case I added

1206
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:41,060
a grant function to DMS and I added some

1207
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:45,260
recent things about TMS of our scenario

1208
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:48,960
in my opinion it's a minor change is so

1209
01:10:45,260 --> 01:11:03,090
is it okay to modify the use case

1210
01:10:48,960 --> 01:11:07,260
working draft sorry I just drinking

1211
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:10,409
water so I think we have discussed this

1212
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:12,300
point in the main list so and I assert

1213
01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:16,070
as a one of course of the history after

1214
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:20,099
I have discussed with our lead leading a

1215
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:23,130
co-editor and we tend to occur in that

1216
01:11:20,099 --> 01:11:25,500
you have proposed some new description

1217
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:27,989
of the existing just cases and this is

1218
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:31,290
also not a very big change to all

1219
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:34,500
current EU this new use case so so if

1220
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:37,829
you are idea to meet meet I think we can

1221
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:39,960
update this use case draft to the new

1222
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:42,809
ocean we're just very little change and

1223
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:45,050
then still can go the next step process

1224
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:45,050
and

1225
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:51,519
the question to ideal whether we need a

1226
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:54,559
new working ground last goal because the

1227
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:59,480
new skis draft already in application

1228
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:04,340
requested state is updating yeah I think

1229
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:07,250
that I think that the the use cases

1230
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:09,440
draft is you know still early enough in

1231
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:14,660
the process that we can come back and

1232
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:18,320
make some more changes to it from the

1233
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:21,110
the process point of view it probably is

1234
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,700
worth just you know doing a quick in one

1235
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:24,589
week

1236
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:26,300
hey we added this stuff please you know

1237
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:31,400
now's your last chance to object sort of

1238
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:40,130
a very short last call yeah thank you

1239
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:44,210
very much i coming should come in so

1240
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:49,120
yeah I wrote that three point three

1241
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:51,980
fiction then I'm I'm not okay with the

1242
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:56,480
fortification 2d dot diagram because it

1243
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:59,450
is confusing so we had to you to update

1244
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:02,889
those take Eastern diagram with young

1245
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:16,150
people every point on bye-bye so then

1246
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:21,110
reading one week I thank you this rice

1247
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:24,250
shows about dot Jacob Eric applicability

1248
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:28,670
and deployment consideration about my

1249
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:31,250
scenario the draft organized this a what

1250
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:33,950
type of dots protocol can be used on

1251
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:37,280
what type of information can be conveyed

1252
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:41,780
it on effective a to carry out my

1253
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:44,240
scenario current a dot spec is not

1254
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:47,809
enough to carry out the scenario about

1255
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:50,750
dot spec including expansion such as a

1256
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:54,430
core home draft or a filter in control

1257
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:57,200
draft is enough to carry out my scenario

1258
01:13:54,430 --> 01:14:00,170
especially ascending source attribute

1259
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:02,570
defined in a core home draft is

1260
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:06,679
effective feasible against deflection

1261
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:08,719
attack it's because our used part of the

1262
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:11,840
friction attack is well-known as a

1263
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:14,540
saucepot information can be conveyed via

1264
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:22,610
inbound link and the attack situation I

1265
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:24,170
think so I think so is working group

1266
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:27,530
adoption about the deployment

1267
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:32,750
consideration part in my opinion there

1268
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:35,179
two options if it's okay well option is

1269
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:39,190
making a new draft about deployment

1270
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:43,640
consideration for working group adoption

1271
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:48,349
I'd like to add more scenario to assess

1272
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:50,690
what type of extension is needed the

1273
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:52,340
other option is just adding at Abraham

1274
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:55,309
the conservation about sending source

1275
01:14:52,340 --> 01:15:01,030
information to call home draft which is

1276
01:14:55,310 --> 01:15:01,030
better for working group or I do not see

1277
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:16,790
any comment so this is a draft so yeah

1278
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,389
first can you go back to the previous

1279
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:21,890
slide

1280
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:26,120
yeah in this case I I have a some

1281
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:28,760
confusing part like first you describe

1282
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:32,360
the invent case the attack time you

1283
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:36,080
divide to two cases like numbers of

1284
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:38,960
reflector is more and in numbers so I'm

1285
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:42,230
confused about how to describe how to

1286
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:46,100
distinguish which is more what kind is

1287
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:49,309
in numbers how much can be small yeah

1288
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:52,520
and this is the first and the second is

1289
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:54,199
that I noticed that you in the

1290
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,900
reflection attack and the noun

1291
01:15:54,199 --> 01:16:00,620
refraction attack you have different

1292
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:04,879
information to be sent like in the left

1293
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:07,640
you send as a source port and in the

1294
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:11,060
right hand in it so I infer that maybe

1295
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:13,670
in the during the non reflection attack

1296
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:16,370
the source is enormous

1297
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:19,040
and during the refraction attack then

1298
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:21,050
the source is not very much so

1299
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:24,949
[Music]

1300
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:27,260
also with this destination port you can

1301
01:16:24,949 --> 01:16:29,719
see that the destination port instant in

1302
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:34,190
the right side and not send in the left

1303
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:36,770
side so I in for well many ports will be

1304
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:39,049
attacked during the reflection attack

1305
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:42,170
and only a few will be attacked during

1306
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:44,000
the no reflection attack so this is

1307
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:46,820
confusing me because I don't know

1308
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,850
whether these are real and whether these

1309
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:53,500
are true you can how do you divide this

1310
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:59,690
based on what references you made this

1311
01:16:53,500 --> 01:17:04,520
conclusion yeah and nasara deal about is

1312
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:09,219
a peacetime aha the the most confusing

1313
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:13,940
part is that the destination IP address

1314
01:17:09,219 --> 01:17:17,690
in charge of one DMS may be a large

1315
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:22,280
number Mont you you only have several

1316
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:25,699
DMS s and the you they are in charge of

1317
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:28,370
the whole traffic of your network so the

1318
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:31,519
tester IP address which will be attacked

1319
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:33,949
under during the attack time how could

1320
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,980
you know that in the peacetime and how

1321
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:42,790
could you send it to if you don't know

1322
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:50,449
how do you send it I mean you know ok so

1323
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:53,660
I want to answer one but so many

1324
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:58,879
questions maybe maybe I resent it too

1325
01:17:53,660 --> 01:18:17,599
many lists and this please send it to me

1326
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:23,590
because I can ask how many people has

1327
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,590
rare disease draft yeah

1328
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:30,188
I think here are some people in the

1329
01:18:25,749 --> 01:18:33,909
inordinately they already read it's

1330
01:18:30,189 --> 01:18:37,479
interesting draft and the T was a a new

1331
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:40,558
a new view of who whole operators use

1332
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:44,739
our protocol I think that's variable but

1333
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:48,130
you know this is where you leave it away

1334
01:18:44,739 --> 01:18:50,289
new document so we can not make division

1335
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:53,439
right now we hope that the people can

1336
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:56,438
really give comments and give cars with

1337
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:59,919
you to improve the draft and about your

1338
01:18:56,439 --> 01:19:03,639
request about to go about it at

1339
01:18:59,919 --> 01:19:06,519
deployment configuration I think it may

1340
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:08,530
be a choice it should be useful but alas

1341
01:19:06,519 --> 01:19:11,650
dear it's based on the quality of the

1342
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:13,059
draft right so we'll become more more

1343
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:20,799
comments and discussion and then next

1344
01:19:13,059 --> 01:19:27,719
edition that okay Constitution draft and

1345
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:33,039
I'd like to many operators to become a

1346
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:35,249
co-author and I want to write this that

1347
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:39,449
sucks

1348
01:19:35,249 --> 01:19:39,449
okay thank you you yeah

1349
01:19:50,050 --> 01:20:07,630
okay meeting you either that not your

1350
01:19:53,930 --> 01:20:07,630
time okay okay and I all my presentation

1351
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:27,130
hello okay you can continue okay okay

1352
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:31,160
I'm also interested in your drift I

1353
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:35,510
agree with your solution and now I have

1354
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:41,500
a not reducing about it it's exist any

1355
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:47,120
other Macrinus to prevent Ms for wrote

1356
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:53,860
fencing at once like Jeju at the MS and

1357
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:53,860
a lot locate amount of medication cafe

1358
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:06,410
I'm here from entity so maybe there's no

1359
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:15,129
time so present automating this to your

1360
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:18,220
question on IV answer it okay so

1361
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:21,280
we have finishing his presentation and

1362
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:23,110
for the tan readin we have we must go to

1363
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,349
the next presentation it's for you

1364
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:33,700
so clean study annotation I missed it

1365
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:38,200
harsh it's okay yeah yeah you're so low

1366
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:43,830
a hierarchy deployment so please start

1367
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:49,179
your planet Asia he thank you well his

1368
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:53,170
new job for self development man poor

1369
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:56,770
man was all this of my spirit issue is

1370
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:59,440
to attract person's attention and

1371
01:21:56,770 --> 01:22:06,670
discuss more on how to decorate or

1372
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:18,099
server we made some recommendation next

1373
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:21,700
to select we all we all notice that

1374
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:25,030
there are several development is

1375
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:29,440
mentioned in current drift when we want

1376
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:32,830
to apply possibly her of her week

1377
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:35,919
hopefully in tremendous requirements

1378
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:39,820
have a look of the drafts mentioning the

1379
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:42,910
current content of deployment ok I

1380
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:51,969
copied the detailed descriptions to the

1381
01:22:42,910 --> 01:23:00,250
next slide you can see that those

1382
01:22:51,970 --> 01:23:05,620
architectures is a scribe and attack a

1383
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:10,690
kicked is expected to be her be called

1384
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:13,480
locally in the same administration and a

1385
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:19,509
server and my feature within the same

1386
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:23,969
German Ian Arnold was every story at

1387
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:27,370
least that he foramen of those is

1388
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:29,490
definitely our network creatures to be

1389
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:33,480
able to cope

1390
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:38,330
right mr. current does ever information

1391
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:42,030
consistent but how to pick right is

1392
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:43,640
correct as ever it has no more details

1393
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:50,910
about it

1394
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:54,090
next slide also a mod homemade raft

1395
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:57,420
he says the postcard among a savior

1396
01:23:54,090 --> 01:24:00,930
verbal masters lacquered of several host

1397
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:05,880
Network has either fixed from which

1398
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:11,190
Taglit preface and Hackett IP Jesse's

1399
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:14,190
are delightful and how to treat it well

1400
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:24,059
it still have no more information about

1401
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:26,750
how to do so I put up my considerations

1402
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,750
about it

1403
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:37,350
amid the deployment requirements is nice

1404
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:44,490
32 ounce and Shepherd pretty of the

1405
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:46,710
severed and I also listed the related

1406
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:48,920
drafts and confessed about ourselves a

1407
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:56,190
bit deep

1408
01:24:48,920 --> 01:25:01,190
Herman's next slide spinning in the

1409
01:24:56,190 --> 01:25:06,080
signature no section for but for one

1410
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:09,599
does ever master rarity I get Grievous

1411
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:14,460
away seeing the scope of the kind Amin

1412
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:17,490
and in the section and a slice a Sarah

1413
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:21,480
master verify that requesting das kind

1414
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:26,719
are entitled to trigger actions on

1415
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:30,839
giving IP prefix and their impact

1416
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:34,620
chimneys for the the severity at the

1417
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:35,970
target preface obviously isto ascribe

1418
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:39,090
Dhamma is

1419
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:41,400
foramen specific it just say the

1420
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:43,790
specific and amid all more things about

1421
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,790
it

1422
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:54,840
in the course also Redco home haha yeah

1423
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:59,130
it's an occasion us right muster

1424
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:05,730
validates that hacker prefix are within

1425
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:09,860
scope of a severed or me as older it is

1426
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:13,190
the just mentioned about the poignant

1427
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:13,190
rests light

1428
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:26,639
and that's like

1429
01:26:32,739 --> 01:26:42,419
how to satisfy their requirement we need

1430
01:26:38,469 --> 01:26:46,150
most the new discussions about

1431
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:52,690
appointment and the functionality and is

1432
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:57,460
ours hard to implement it in my draft I

1433
01:26:52,690 --> 01:27:00,009
have to see that my motivation is is to

1434
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:04,469
provide earth guidance for operators

1435
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:08,650
from my point we have writing about our

1436
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:12,250
appearances as an SP and we hope that

1437
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:17,610
other signals will be well controlled as

1438
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:21,010
building the first have to come into

1439
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:27,809
consideration is what kind of equal mass

1440
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:30,850
can be met Gators oh my oh my parents

1441
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:36,100
they have three kinds of mud Gators

1442
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:43,570
first it's routine to trip back home you

1443
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:47,170
discard order a fake role no matter tech

1444
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:51,099
traffic or normal traffic and the second

1445
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:58,890
is special training equipment does mean

1446
01:27:51,100 --> 01:28:04,150
that it can creator attack attack for an

1447
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:08,820
amputee normal the fake pack tutor to

1448
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:12,820
the attack target and the Third Kind is

1449
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:20,290
network network security equipment

1450
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:22,989
I sing doctorís IPS and I guess and I

1451
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:30,880
were or anything

1452
01:28:22,989 --> 01:28:31,870
I mean security equipment no Acosta come

1453
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,430
to my might

1454
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:41,320
hacer exists as a single network are

1455
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:44,700
meant no I think it should hand on earth

1456
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,700
existing equipment

1457
01:28:46,500 --> 01:29:04,840
next light and how to Troy iserror have

1458
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:07,690
to satisfy their conditions I list the

1459
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:12,820
four conditions that should admit first

1460
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:15,759
lies the severed to do in connected with

1461
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:18,219
marketer who most of the my teachers are

1462
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:22,210
our intranet enviroments

1463
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:27,010
this mean that a sarakin connector base

1464
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:31,510
my cater but my data cannot maybe maybe

1465
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:35,320
cannot connect twist or Sarah the second

1466
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:39,040
is a CEREC Engel blackberry to the

1467
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:42,960
Megiddo which had a stable slew without

1468
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:46,120
an other those agents such as those way

1469
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,750
the service is those Sarah has the

1470
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:53,230
permissions for scheduling and

1471
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:57,610
operations on medicator it is because

1472
01:29:53,230 --> 01:30:00,429
that a Sarah wary site which one to to

1473
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:01,630
demand Asia ought to are do not and

1474
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:05,320
which to do it

1475
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:09,040
and last wise sarah has the Paley do you

1476
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:19,960
know the adjust of a tech package which

1477
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:26,080
Matt Gator because I say I think either

1478
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:35,920
correct correct a Sarah who do

1479
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:41,880
medication well be more efficient next

1480
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:53,370
just like we have to put forward to

1481
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:53,370
mineral first one is tiis face and so

1482
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:06,269
tech update no okay so

1483
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:16,449
tack traffic different ask me mr. Sarah

1484
01:31:06,269 --> 01:31:24,869
installed in the in the entrance in the

1485
01:31:16,449 --> 01:31:31,089
entry point for example if I ask me a

1486
01:31:24,869 --> 01:31:39,489
receive attacks from RSVP and he asked

1487
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:47,260
us several CQ to the medication nests

1488
01:31:39,489 --> 01:31:56,530
light and the Nardo senior is inside an

1489
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:59,789
SV I have I have I have beside network

1490
01:31:56,530 --> 01:32:04,478
for three layers

1491
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:09,429
look o air network mature written l

1492
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:13,889
network and iphone network i I divide

1493
01:32:09,429 --> 01:32:20,369
into three layers please cause that the

1494
01:32:13,889 --> 01:32:26,409
trend mobile might over network as this

1495
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:30,938
architecture so we think in the entry

1496
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:34,268
point of her most important aruthor

1497
01:32:30,939 --> 01:32:38,289
like a computer main rotor and a

1498
01:32:34,269 --> 01:32:49,499
deceiver me like really want to install

1499
01:32:38,289 --> 01:32:56,768
a sterile and ancestor concept of

1500
01:32:49,499 --> 01:32:57,880
concept of I of her a triple appointment

1501
01:32:56,769 --> 01:33:06,610
motor

1502
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:09,719
I feel so comments and questions are

1503
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:14,259
broken to me

1504
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:18,300
hi Millie this is way back from Maui

1505
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:21,150
I have read their draft I think it's a

1506
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:24,490
reasonable work it's a good good

1507
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:27,639
direction for discussion because you

1508
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:31,210
want to deploy the thoughts but maybe

1509
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:35,920
you encountered some difficulties when

1510
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:38,290
you really reading the drafts and you

1511
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,710
listed them some requirements that you

1512
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:44,110
don't know how to fix I think that is

1513
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:45,190
good because you encounter this

1514
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:48,099
difficulties

1515
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:50,559
others may also encounter this and you

1516
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:55,900
listed them out and we can discuss how

1517
01:33:50,560 --> 01:34:00,910
to solve them and this is a first part I

1518
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:05,740
think you can highlight them and we can

1519
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:08,889
have more discussion and for first for

1520
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:14,429
the four conditions you listed listed

1521
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:17,680
that should be met I think that some are

1522
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:19,990
conspicuous like the first one toast

1523
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:24,240
over has to be in turn connected to

1524
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:26,889
mitigator I I think that is a it's

1525
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:29,500
conspicuous it's everyone need to do

1526
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:31,540
that or otherwise you cannot connect it

1527
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:35,530
you cannot communicate how could you do

1528
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:39,600
the mitigation and some others I think

1529
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:42,070
that the last one is also is a

1530
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:45,970
requirements list you you listed it

1531
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:50,950
before in the face signal channel or go

1532
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:54,250
home channel and I think that you you

1533
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:56,980
you you don't need I mean you can't just

1534
01:34:54,250 --> 01:35:01,330
the list as a conditions it's it's

1535
01:34:56,980 --> 01:35:03,429
another requirements compared with the

1536
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:07,690
bass signal channel and you need to find

1537
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:17,100
out is caching or some solutions for

1538
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:21,580
these requirements and and you're the

1539
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:25,990
between ISPs and the inside IP the the

1540
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:26,619
diagram the network top is is good but I

1541
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:30,580
I don't think

1542
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:33,070
it's very clear because I didn't find a

1543
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:36,730
way that those crimes are in the between

1544
01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:40,030
the ISPs and only one post client in the

1545
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:42,129
inside Insp isn't enough so I'm also

1546
01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:45,610
confused I think it's needed more

1547
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:54,000
detailed and maybe more discussion and

1548
01:35:45,610 --> 01:36:01,089
thought about yeah we already made their

1549
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:04,570
open cost appointment you say that the

1550
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:09,599
conditions while and conditions for pass

1551
01:36:04,570 --> 01:36:14,190
another requirement I agree with you and

1552
01:36:09,599 --> 01:36:19,409
maybe we can do more detail and either

1553
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:23,379
solution to for this question and

1554
01:36:19,409 --> 01:36:26,309
discuss more in the email list and the

1555
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:35,619
last country together so this election

1556
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:39,280
Professor Graham thank you yeah hi Mary

1557
01:36:35,619 --> 01:36:41,320
Anne Frank and was a contributor under

1558
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:46,889
the tree I think my personal suggestion

1559
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:52,540
is please clarify your your request or -

1560
01:36:46,889 --> 01:36:54,219
ha - say - I also don't see the really

1561
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:57,010
requirements for the working room what

1562
01:36:54,219 --> 01:37:01,389
we can do which is a problem you are

1563
01:36:57,010 --> 01:37:05,020
facing I think you will see your draft

1564
01:37:01,389 --> 01:37:07,239
us on write book document to describe

1565
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:09,369
how you use current the protocol but I

1566
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:12,659
don't see any problem I see we have

1567
01:37:09,369 --> 01:37:17,949
already covered all your Robin or your

1568
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:21,129
scenario so maybe you should look at the

1569
01:37:17,949 --> 01:37:23,530
current protocol more and to describe

1570
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:26,080
clearly what is your problem

1571
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:31,030
and what is your new use cases so we can

1572
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:35,559
discuss based on them okay Herman

1573
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:37,630
I will internestor version I will like

1574
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:40,289
more detail about your question and

1575
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:53,849
deals case okay

1576
01:37:40,289 --> 01:38:01,289
you can continue your next flight it's

1577
01:37:53,849 --> 01:38:04,500
my another drafted this draft I will

1578
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:06,809
show you our suggestions or attack

1579
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:11,989
information is carried I might get there

1580
01:38:06,809 --> 01:38:20,039
first and much response lastly sir

1581
01:38:11,989 --> 01:38:23,218
Lester's likes German security this

1582
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:25,829
hammer of new last meet me in cargo

1583
01:38:23,219 --> 01:38:28,710
they come up to death device for the

1584
01:38:25,829 --> 01:38:31,440
goal to eight parameter of attack was

1585
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:34,559
during my vision first another is to

1586
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:39,808
eight I promise

1587
01:38:34,559 --> 01:38:42,510
unify definition as I see pass the

1588
01:38:39,809 --> 01:38:47,190
presentation I had to escape deter

1589
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:52,530
commas that mapping Lister will slow

1590
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:56,570
their probe of friend and many offer at

1591
01:38:52,530 --> 01:39:02,070
a type I do agree with that and without

1592
01:38:56,570 --> 01:39:05,820
any unified definition walk we really

1593
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:10,739
have a blister for making with different

1594
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:14,579
vendors reason for confuse attack is

1595
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:18,928
that anti-ddos project is ahead of the

1596
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:23,340
standard floor admin but it is not a

1597
01:39:18,929 --> 01:39:30,599
reason to continue a lot of technicians

1598
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:36,650
and an in their architecture assess in

1599
01:39:30,599 --> 01:39:39,210
the of that kind signal may also include

1600
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:42,119
anniversary information about the attack

1601
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:47,010
if their thoughts kind halves such

1602
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:50,630
informations of verbal in my new draft I

1603
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:54,210
merge the two just at 80 another two

1604
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:57,750
parameters have to

1605
01:39:54,210 --> 01:40:03,500
our detection system can provide all the

1606
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:03,500
informations that ain't it he might at

1607
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:22,799
next light this slide Alistair the

1608
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:26,550
attack advise an attack type use age for

1609
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:30,240
the medication and cooperation at a gym

1610
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:33,840
and have to say that compared with

1611
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:36,840
operations at the time is credible of

1612
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:40,170
course operated under the only one who

1613
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:44,540
apply just mention it so we chose it as

1614
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:49,010
a channel parameter in not a mandatory

1615
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:54,440
remember off of in their case of

1616
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:54,440
liability we may not use this parameter

1617
01:40:55,700 --> 01:41:05,210
for my point was attacked advice and

1618
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:08,880
that I type help for those medication

1619
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:12,000
type at might have three uses the first

1620
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:14,850
is for random selection seconds for

1621
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,590
election pace lecture and last of our

1622
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:23,900
outreach is to offer the extreme attack

1623
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:27,030
traffic and the male's of attack type is

1624
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:31,009
formatting issue incorporation identify

1625
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:36,269
attack abroad consistent action type and

1626
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:40,770
clinic face and trend vendors ever skin

1627
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:43,670
coverage - okay daddy does attack and it

1628
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:52,760
is important to address that because the

1629
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:52,760
action is under take time next slide

1630
01:41:58,489 --> 01:42:06,768
and this slide will show you us we

1631
01:42:01,889 --> 01:42:11,249
figure about her usage of advice

1632
01:42:06,769 --> 01:42:14,629
the first sir is for early endeavor

1633
01:42:11,249 --> 01:42:19,228
selection and the second is for

1634
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:28,820
reelection a selection and the third is

1635
01:42:19,229 --> 01:42:32,070
for fraud extreme extreme tech traffic

1636
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:43,079
and one of you interest about it we can

1637
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:47,539
discuss more detail and last light this

1638
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:51,959
side also silver Tech type what we can

1639
01:42:47,539 --> 01:42:56,090
what we can to be static type one we can

1640
01:42:51,959 --> 01:42:59,959
see that most of our 30 das attack our

1641
01:42:56,090 --> 01:43:05,849
mixture attack and different my teacher

1642
01:42:59,959 --> 01:43:11,389
to better the monster in or for one type

1643
01:43:05,849 --> 01:43:18,539
of fit of the das though mr. attack um

1644
01:43:11,389 --> 01:43:23,219
Ignace less aromatic a turd for friend

1645
01:43:18,539 --> 01:43:30,539
attack type and they still can they can

1646
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:36,119
figure is that a have still is and still

1647
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:39,688
is friend that the disguise received her

1648
01:43:36,119 --> 01:43:44,070
attack type and refer to the server and

1649
01:43:39,689 --> 01:43:50,059
the dose server Oscar a gator hey help

1650
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:53,820
me to do like do medication and the

1651
01:43:50,059 --> 01:43:57,989
attack is most likely this attack type

1652
01:43:53,820 --> 01:44:03,780
some education and to immediately miss

1653
01:43:57,989 --> 01:44:08,489
without any time waste and lasted again

1654
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:13,259
is history first two ways

1655
01:44:08,489 --> 01:44:20,940
take time like attic type to the tosser

1656
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:31,469
and those kind can and get their Staters

1657
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:37,039
of permutation yes like we all have

1658
01:44:31,469 --> 01:44:41,489
notice that if you don't if you have

1659
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:44,730
subscriber mail list my draft absence in

1660
01:44:41,489 --> 01:44:51,178
khammam a still owes draft a dastard us

1661
01:44:44,730 --> 01:44:56,218
I'm actually but but the man frenzy

1662
01:44:51,179 --> 01:45:01,139
France is that we propose before Nellie

1663
01:44:56,219 --> 01:45:05,070
Laura why do we do this is because that

1664
01:45:01,139 --> 01:45:08,849
we have more than three suppliers to

1665
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:15,349
provide it a screen equal mess and there

1666
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:20,789
are many more under market just in China

1667
01:45:15,349 --> 01:45:23,489
as owning 13% in common of those attack

1668
01:45:20,789 --> 01:45:32,999
Nam so that's the motivation we want to

1669
01:45:23,489 --> 01:45:37,730
do the unify unified clinician as we see

1670
01:45:32,999 --> 01:45:44,849
in the table one we just have two

1671
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:49,129
parameters for mandatory and I have

1672
01:45:44,849 --> 01:45:55,340
three three parameters for mandatory and

1673
01:45:49,130 --> 01:46:02,480
the order are optional and most yeah the

1674
01:45:55,340 --> 01:46:02,480
most important I want to sure mr. hunger

1675
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:14,780
also we want to do the technique

1676
01:46:09,469 --> 01:46:19,499
compress definition we also supply

1677
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:22,230
evasion definition this mean that no

1678
01:46:19,499 --> 01:46:30,739
need to transfer a sport

1679
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:51,629
the other is in the link we can see more

1680
01:46:30,739 --> 01:46:56,269
up city after link nest light and the

1681
01:46:51,630 --> 01:47:00,600
two new parameters I ate in my job is a

1682
01:46:56,270 --> 01:47:05,190
Texas IP number and a Kate tech type

1683
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:07,380
childer it has to say that for those

1684
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:10,110
detection and warning there's a scheme

1685
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:13,920
provided for a Texas

1686
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:17,719
so this of Texas is so distribution

1687
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:22,080
around world is hard to allocate IP

1688
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:25,590
addresses in this scenario Denver IP

1689
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:30,360
address is prefixed well no help for

1690
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:34,470
their medication and very current actual

1691
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:39,269
equipment is aced on the type of attack

1692
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:42,620
Erin set our face the results and the

1693
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:45,000
target at a captured help me illustrate

1694
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:50,130
raster according to their actual

1695
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:52,800
situation and most importantly Singh is

1696
01:47:50,130 --> 01:48:07,140
it can help to reduce their false

1697
01:47:52,800 --> 01:48:10,290
areum's let's just light emily i this we

1698
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:12,930
don't have enough time so we have one

1699
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:15,269
presentation frontier ooh it's a very

1700
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:17,580
similar like your proposal about the

1701
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:21,000
more more more attacking formation

1702
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:23,820
morton energy for the toss protocol so I

1703
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,770
suggest awake go into next presentation

1704
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:29,460
directory and then if we have time we

1705
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:34,770
can have other comments discussion of

1706
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:38,250
these two drafts okay okay thank you

1707
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:42,060
so - are you here so it's your time so

1708
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:59,210
and sorry for no so many time left for

1709
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:59,210
you so please speed up oh okay yes yes

1710
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:18,260
okay so to recap right I mean

1711
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:24,300
Dodge telemetry was presented in 98 97

1712
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:27,260
by and the time since the decision was

1713
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:27,260
proposed for this work

1714
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:36,660
now I see a renewed interest in the

1715
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:37,799
working group to pursue this work so so

1716
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:39,720
as part of the discussion around that

1717
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:42,510
time there was an update to the

1718
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:44,550
requirement strap saying that the client

1719
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:47,130
can supply medication hints which could

1720
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:49,650
be attacked our meetings and that could

1721
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:51,630
be leveraged by the dorsal but they just

1722
01:49:49,650 --> 01:49:54,780
gonna be treated as hints and the

1723
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:56,430
thoughts of our make money for them what

1724
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:58,110
we're trying to do in downstream Utley

1725
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:59,910
is not just to define the attack

1726
01:49:58,110 --> 01:50:02,339
description or at Nvidia's but also to

1727
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:05,340
convey the normal baseline attributes

1728
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:07,830
and you know in the next place and talk

1729
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:09,570
about why the normal baseline attributes

1730
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:11,460
are useful for a loss detection and

1731
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:14,820
mitigation and these attributes are just

1732
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:17,370
optional and to decide whether it first

1733
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:19,519
we use it or we know that next slide

1734
01:50:17,370 --> 01:50:19,519
please

1735
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:29,009
okay the motivation for dot statement

1736
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:31,230
you ready to see typically ten years

1737
01:50:29,010 --> 01:50:34,800
probably most of the traffic baselines

1738
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:37,290
both ash roadways but now with more

1739
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:40,200
option of ML techniques if it's more of

1740
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:42,870
a detection based on human techniques

1741
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:45,080
create a baseline and any deviation from

1742
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:45,080
that

1743
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:49,900
and Men mortals now this normal

1744
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:52,180
traveling with traffic baseline would

1745
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:54,670
take a few hours to a few weeks to

1746
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:56,170
baseline and understand for a network

1747
01:50:54,670 --> 01:51:01,330
infrastructure or for an application

1748
01:50:56,170 --> 01:51:04,300
what's a novel dis length and that's

1749
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:06,070
invaluable information that idot's

1750
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:08,949
client each has a DDoS ticket or a

1751
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:11,799
mediator can share it also because the

1752
01:51:08,949 --> 01:51:15,040
dots over when it's in both the Indian

1753
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:18,520
attack it may not have the time to learn

1754
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:21,699
and create this line though this the

1755
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:24,370
other use case would be that there could

1756
01:51:21,699 --> 01:51:26,199
be multiple doors clients in the network

1757
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:28,510
into the door server and they may not

1758
01:51:26,199 --> 01:51:30,129
have complete visibility to that but

1759
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:32,020
since the dot server is receiving the

1760
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:34,480
information from all these clients who

1761
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:36,460
really know what kind of attack what

1762
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:42,910
kind of multivator attack important of

1763
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:45,160
multi is using to basically the victims

1764
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:47,290
infrastructure the third advantage

1765
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:49,150
because of the feedback that is gonna be

1766
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:51,460
exchanged between the dots client and

1767
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:53,620
server is gonna be it's gonna reduce the

1768
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:55,810
time for we're eating that axle they

1769
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:58,900
don't server can basically identify the

1770
01:51:55,810 --> 01:52:00,760
right set of countermeasures Praxis of

1771
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:02,469
resources data centers to mitigate the

1772
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:04,870
attack and it won't also help reduce

1773
01:52:02,469 --> 01:52:07,239
false negatives and false positives

1774
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:10,680
further if you see today many of the

1775
01:52:07,239 --> 01:52:13,449
DDoS attacks are both multi-vector and

1776
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:15,460
mutate in the sense that they initially

1777
01:52:13,449 --> 01:52:17,500
targeted particular target and then they

1778
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:19,090
change the target just to through the

1779
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:23,680
security operations or the automated

1780
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:25,920
techniques get confused or effective

1781
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:28,540
mechanism so for handling these

1782
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,100
multi-vector attacks it's good to share

1783
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:33,180
that information so the dot server

1784
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:37,000
ultimately knows how the media has been

1785
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:42,250
waiting and to know how how it would

1786
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:44,080
properly mitigate in the future so the

1787
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:45,850
last point would be that the dot admit

1788
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:47,410
is not just from the client server but

1789
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:49,330
also from the server to client so that

1790
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:52,420
the client knows what kind of quarter

1791
01:52:49,330 --> 01:52:54,389
measures are being used and I had for

1792
01:52:52,420 --> 01:53:01,679
the client cooking feedback whether

1793
01:52:54,389 --> 01:53:04,699
- insolent peace so the use case for

1794
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:07,409
this has to be that the rods command

1795
01:53:04,699 --> 01:53:09,509
network has a DDoS mitigation system

1796
01:53:07,409 --> 01:53:12,480
already knows detector which basically

1797
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:15,600
is looking at the traffic base lining

1798
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:17,669
the traffic and medication and the

1799
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:22,889
medication exceeds the threshold on the

1800
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:25,260
capacity of the immune system and that's

1801
01:53:22,889 --> 01:53:27,630
when all the normal base lining it would

1802
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:30,060
have done and that high traffic it would

1803
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:32,010
have seen put a signal back to the dot

1804
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:34,830
server as inside the door so we can use

1805
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:41,369
that information to decide the right on

1806
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:44,969
strategy and slide please so we have

1807
01:53:41,369 --> 01:53:46,199
defined a bunch of attributes and based

1808
01:53:44,969 --> 01:53:52,619
on the discussion in the working group

1809
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:56,280
in the last week I see this is doesn't

1810
01:53:52,619 --> 01:53:58,199
change them we're categorizing materials

1811
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:00,409
into three sets of categories one is the

1812
01:53:58,199 --> 01:54:02,428
pre medication at unit studies the

1813
01:54:00,409 --> 01:54:04,980
attributes that will be signaled by the

1814
01:54:02,429 --> 01:54:08,340
client in peacetime assumption is that

1815
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:09,690
the client has a has a DDoS detector our

1816
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:11,610
flow collector which basically is

1817
01:54:09,690 --> 01:54:14,040
collecting all the telemetry and

1818
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:18,559
basically identifying what's a normal

1819
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:20,730
behavior or the normal capacity of the

1820
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:23,340
infrastructure so that using good

1821
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:27,709
understanding on to the doors over later

1822
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:27,710
that this is the normal baseline that

1823
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:38,820
the second part is my name is already

1824
01:54:37,139 --> 01:54:41,369
covered this to some extent this was

1825
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:44,280
also this is to basically give more

1826
01:54:41,369 --> 01:54:49,320
details on that that client is see so it

1827
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:51,360
would improve the total and then various

1828
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:58,530
attributes regarding the details like

1829
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:59,969
the vendor ID the vendor ID for the

1830
01:54:58,530 --> 01:55:02,940
security vendor Center price number

1831
01:54:59,969 --> 01:55:06,030
which each picketed that and unique

1832
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:08,638
local identifier for that prescription

1833
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:10,619
we did not go with a standardizing that

1834
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:13,110
and because as we all know it keeps

1835
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:15,719
changing and there is no way that I can

1836
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:18,809
catch up with new and evolving DDoS

1837
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:20,699
attacks and then we have added an attack

1838
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:25,340
severity to basically sequel what kind

1839
01:55:20,699 --> 01:55:27,210
of level of attack severity that the

1840
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:28,580
infrastructure is seeing with regard to

1841
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:33,540
the DDoS attack

1842
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:35,880
next slide please the second one is

1843
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:38,250
going to be again from the client to the

1844
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:40,500
server basically signaling whether the

1845
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:43,500
attack was effective or not in this case

1846
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:45,119
input signal the total attack it's still

1847
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:48,389
seeing even after the mitigation being

1848
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:53,549
applied and if it sees some attacks

1849
01:55:48,389 --> 01:55:55,320
still being left out and in system in

1850
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:58,500
signals back to the torso was saying

1851
01:55:55,320 --> 01:56:01,860
that it's still seeing which are which

1852
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:04,349
are supposed to so this actually creates

1853
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:07,259
include back and forth communication

1854
01:56:04,349 --> 01:56:09,060
between the operations it becomes

1855
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:11,130
infrastructure and the security

1856
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:20,699
operation center who is dealing with the

1857
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:22,440
DDoS mitigation to really see the

1858
01:56:20,699 --> 01:56:24,960
medication status would be the door

1859
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:28,320
server candle back to the client with

1860
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:31,560
all the mechanisms it's using all the

1861
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:32,880
type of attacks it's seeing and any

1862
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:35,400
subset of the second substrate

1863
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:44,000
continuing or some of the subsets of

1864
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:50,790
this especially for the target keeps GG

1865
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:53,460
next so since this is the revival of the

1866
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:55,199
trap that was submitted to us back I

1867
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:59,790
think we need more comments and

1868
01:56:55,199 --> 01:57:02,119
discussions in the in group or any

1869
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:02,119
questions

1870
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:14,530
hi dear this is weapon I have a question

1871
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:18,910
that I understand that the motivations

1872
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:23,019
and I agree with you and I support this

1873
01:57:18,910 --> 01:57:27,700
kind of saying but I'm I'm doubt about

1874
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:31,660
the how to use the term entry and I

1875
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:34,900
think what must be conveyed in the

1876
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:37,389
telemetry is is important but is not the

1877
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:42,849
most thing we need to figure out the

1878
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:47,140
first and I think the one in that which

1879
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:49,750
is a use cases and how to use the

1880
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:54,460
telemetry and if it's a suit port you

1881
01:57:49,750 --> 01:58:13,020
use an under attack I mean and this

1882
01:57:54,460 --> 01:58:13,020
should be and if we can be used and I

1883
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:18,779
[Music]

1884
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:39,940
also have some such comments about the

1885
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:47,950
detail and I'm a comments on the

1886
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:54,429
meninist yeah any more comments question

1887
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:57,670
for clarification okay thank you

1888
01:58:54,430 --> 01:59:00,870
this is where a new chapter for this

1889
01:58:57,670 --> 01:59:04,420
stage so we still need more discussion

1890
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:07,420
it's okay so thank you - and I think

1891
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:09,580
away we finished all our presentation

1892
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:15,070
really on on time

1893
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:18,519
yeah two minutes left but so if anyone

1894
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:20,080
has any more mostly want to discuss here

1895
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:23,170
open

1896
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:32,740
if they ask note I think we can finish

1897
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:35,740
today's session and have also topic in

1898
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:37,719
agenda to discuss and change possible

1899
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:39,969
changes in the Charter that I think

1900
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:46,000
we'll discuss it later with our ad

1901
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:49,000
because no time today and we also are

1902
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:52,450
Griesa discussion ami enlisted to let

1903
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:54,760
everybody know the latest progress but I

1904
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:57,010
also see that it's just a not very big

1905
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:58,540
change just update our mind stone and

1906
01:59:57,010 --> 02:00:01,060
the were released will change the on

1907
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:03,670
watch other to be included the D point

1908
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:08,170
in the consideration document in our

1909
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:10,420
currently charter that's all information

1910
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:13,510
okay thank you everyone thank you for

1911
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:16,270
today's yeah to this join and the seeing

1912
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:20,400
singable in next time bye-bye

1913
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:23,820
if anybody doesn't sign your sheet yet

1914
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:23,820
going turn
