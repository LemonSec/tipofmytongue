1
00:00:22,340 --> 00:01:18,180
show yourself down folks I'm alright

2
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:25,970
we're gonna start so take a seat

3
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:32,700
oh good that's what when Campbell sorry

4
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:34,890
thanks so we're sharing the slot today

5
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:40,290
with ster so we have an hour for a

6
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:43,620
meeting let's get into the bits oh look

7
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:52,260
at that it's terrible yeah you need

8
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:53,400
space not space really okay because this

9
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,480
is the start of the week I'm going to

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,050
spend a little bit of time on this one

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,480
the note well outlines your obligations

12
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,179
as you participate in this meeting that

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,710
means at a high level we want

14
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,670
professional conduct here be civil be

15
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,280
kind to your fellow human being and also

16
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,488
let us know if you have intellectual

17
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,900
property rights or are aware of any that

18
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:22,889
relate to the things that you're talking

19
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,019
about I'm assuming everyone is familiar

20
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:28,040
with this but it's worth spending a

21
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,040
month think about that

22
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:51,290
this is the why we are here slide I'm

23
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,250
going to tweet more that's how we start

24
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,750
work groups that's that's awesome this

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,609
is not why we started that working group

26
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,609
that make you mad for reminding us why

27
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:08,209
so that probably one bash related to

28
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,548
this one that Tommy's going to spend a

29
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,139
couple of minutes talking about the the

30
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:18,980
API we're going to do that after the

31
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:21,650
wireless broadband folks a personal

32
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,590
style for a little bit of status when

33
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:29,359
Brian Shields has presentation there

34
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:32,150
about the perspective of the wbba group

35
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,379
and then we're going to talk about some

36
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,709
of the remaining issues that we have on

37
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:39,108
the open drafts that we have I think

38
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,239
Eric you have some slides on 7710 as

39
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:49,669
well yeah

40
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:52,699
okay so I'll let you talk to that for

41
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:54,379
7710 Biss it was a there was a call on

42
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:58,069
the mailing list it was adopted enough

43
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:59,659
loaded as IETF it was we have some

44
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,179
improved content negotiation texts

45
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:04,120
thanks to mark it was moved to the

46
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,090
captive portal working group github

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,190
repository and I wanted to propose a

48
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,540
question for the group and that was

49
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,150
whether or not we should request that

50
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,529
the IETF 106 network run an experiment

51
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,810
where we hand out 7710 this URL that is

52
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,960
takes you to a static web page basically

53
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,539
an API that just has this JSON in it it

54
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,719
just says captive false and the venue

55
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:30,800
info URL takes you to the meeting page

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,150
for the meeting page you can get to the

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,250
agenda and you can get the floor guide

58
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,719
and you can get to the how to get to the

59
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,659
emergency hospital stuff and all that

60
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:39,460
all that good things so if the working

61
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,169
group thinks

62
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,210
this is a good idea I can take care of

63
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,490
sending the request to the naka and

64
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,859
Alisa and so on so you see how this

65
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,889
flies I think it's all a static content

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,229
there's no redirections with ampersands

67
00:04:50,889 --> 00:05:07,569
mac equals SKU IP equals bar kind of

68
00:04:53,229 --> 00:05:09,940
stuff this just simple as can be I'm

69
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:11,710
assuming that information wouldn't be

70
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,509
collecting any actual data about the

71
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,359
people and so we should probably make

72
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,979
that bigger yeah so as a part of the DNS

73
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,180
of rutila's experiment I think we had to

74
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,550
say what data would be collected and

75
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,520
what would not be I was imagining we

76
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,680
would just be interested in the

77
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,698
diversity of user agents and the number

78
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,440
of times the API had been fetched I

79
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:35,560
expect for 106 maybe it won't be that

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,009
many but maybe for 107 things will be

81
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,900
different by then do any of the

82
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,599
implementers any of the operating system

83
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,159
and implementers in the room think that

84
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:49,240
something could possibly query this by

85
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:54,849
Singapore even even an experimental

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,380
build Tommy Polly Apple yeah I think in

87
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:59,580
an experimental build especially like if

88
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,229
we have like hackathon purpose to like

89
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,789
test that explicitly I think that would

90
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:08,349
be good we can definitely do something

91
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:10,360
on iOS or my bus to do that so if every

92
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,419
creators until they - to that end we

93
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,070
should capture the information how many

94
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,659
times we see people connecting to the

95
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,889
URL and how many times we see them

96
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:23,919
trying to use the correct API formats

97
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,500
and the media type requests as opposed

98
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,180
to something that's like doing a legacy

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,289
thing that we don't expect yeah I think

100
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,849
the other should be a thread on the

101
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,349
mailing list about what data we're gonna

102
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:36,909
explicitly say if you collect and what

103
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:39,310
explicitly not to collect and so on yeah

104
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:41,320
definitely it would and one thing that

105
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,820
we'll get out of this is someone's gonna

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,770
have to write down on how a network

107
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,810
operator might actually do something so

108
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,909
in detail in a way that it's easy for

109
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:53,159
them to consume which may not be the

110
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,159
case for the RFC itself the moment so

111
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:05,580
for example do we need an SSL start you

112
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:06,780
know who's gonna issue that he didn't

113
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,380
say where this was hosted but we can

114
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:17,159
work that out

115
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:21,270
yes yes we were willing to say it's much

116
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:26,810
easier to do that let's not worry about

117
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:28,710
yeah so though okay that was that I

118
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:38,100
think that was that unless there's other

119
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:41,729
comments that's all I had on the know is

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:48,150
he is Brian ready right in there see you

121
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:52,320
I see you ready to attempt this some fun

122
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,719
if you can join the queue I think maybe

123
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,860
I don't know how this works but we have

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,860
a big red button that we can let you in

125
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:31,090
can we dope can meet a co-participant

126
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:35,729
spirits and this else did you talk that

127
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,728
yeah so he need to get

128
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,980
okay people the difficulties we're

129
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,849
having here I think we'll skip to the

130
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,590
next one and we'll come back to this one

131
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,060
once I think a couple of minutes for

132
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:27,810
Tommy's presentation and then we'll see

133
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:30,329
how these work out all right hello

134
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:33,030
everyone I'm Tommy Pauly and I'm one of

135
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,090
the co editors of the captive portal API

136
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,939
document we have recently posted a

137
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,280
revision of it not hugely changed what I

138
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,500
did want to give an overview of what we

139
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:49,170
have done and get feedback from the

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:51,770
group on that all right so the relevant

141
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,270
changes to talk about in oh three are we

142
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:58,319
did a much more rigorous definition of

143
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:00,210
the registry for the keys that we would

144
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,100
have in the captive portal API and how

145
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,940
we would allow people to extend that so

146
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,040
that's now a Ayana registry that we're

147
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,340
creating there so this allows us to have

148
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,290
new JSON keys and values to extend this

149
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,020
we definitely do expect this to be

150
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,209
extended the set we have right now is

151
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,730
very minimal for example it does not

152
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,920
allow things to do kind of headless

153
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,390
captive portal Association if you don't

154
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,530
have a UI and that's something that

155
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,340
people would want to do in the future

156
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:31,110
this would allow that we also changed

157
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,280
one of the names of the keys from a

158
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,530
vendor info URL to a venue info URL this

159
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,110
relates to what was being proposed as

160
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,569
the experiment these URLs of how you get

161
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,000
more information about your venue like

162
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:49,050
the IETF meeting is really venue

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,860
specific not like a vendor we also did

164
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,180
make the user portal URL which is the UI

165
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,950
that you would do to actually

166
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,170
authenticate an optional key and set

167
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,210
mandatory to be a little bit more future

168
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,520
proof because we could have things in

169
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,940
the future that do not require that and

170
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,010
then we did fill out the security

171
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,819
consideration section which was just a

172
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,879
to do it

173
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,709
namely summarizes the security

174
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,949
requirements that we list earlier about

175
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,959
how you need to use HTTPS to talk to the

176
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:23,728
portal how you need to do certificate

177
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:27,329
validation etc there was one open issue

178
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:29,369
that's remaining on the github and it

179
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,919
was originally about just we should have

180
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:35,459
a registry so we did that part of it but

181
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,589
there's still a comment about should we

182
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:42,599
within this rarity registry have a

183
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:45,029
specific guidance for how we have either

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,939
sub dictionaries or labels on keys that

185
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:51,410
are organisations specific such as if

186
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:53,879
that WBA wanted a set of keys for things

187
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,009
should there be an official prefix

188
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,019
mechanism that they reserved that way or

189
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:01,499
not I don't have a strong opinion on

190
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:08,100
this but if people do please let us know

191
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:19,169
I think that's it X - is not recommended

192
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:21,749
we do not do X - immediately one one

193
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:23,609
thing that we've heard over and over and

194
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:31,429
over and over kappa portal operators is

195
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:31,429
that they want to be able to continue to

196
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,649
track the same user through the captive

197
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,779
portal login page and through subsequent

198
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,279
activities and the Android default

199
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:44,339
behavior is to take away to capture

200
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,459
portal login page what be long is

201
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,979
complete and one thing that I thought of

202
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,679
that we could use the API for though not

203
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:57,779
at 7-7 end would be if there were a way

204
00:12:52,679 --> 00:13:01,679
to include some sort of section ID in

205
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:05,129
the venue URL so because one of our

206
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,589
plans would be - we have a notification

207
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:10,679
with Cubans you're connected to captive

208
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:13,199
portal right now it says nothing but if

209
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,029
if that had a click here for venue

210
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:18,329
information and an have a section ID

211
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:20,580
then maybe we could put the user back

212
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,279
into their safe flow yes you can I

213
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,050
pay for more stuff that they wanted to

214
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,910
be charged for whatever the only

215
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,189
question there is this can't be really

216
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,910
the 7710 you were all definitely updated

217
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:41,190
because the 7710 URL in the best version

218
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:44,069
points to the api right and yes so there

219
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:49,620
are two URLs that are specified already

220
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:51,540
in the JSON for the API one is the like

221
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,920
the portal URL which is the thing you go

222
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,329
to initially but you could also

223
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,459
essentially go back if you need to re-up

224
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:57,989
your plan and then there's an extra one

225
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:01,709
for like here's the information about

226
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,959
your flight if you need that so imagine

227
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:10,349
you I could link to both deeply all the

228
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:12,029
time especially the early enough in the

229
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,279
flow that that's actually he's not gonna

230
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:19,560
change or do we need to like do another

231
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:31,110
poll of the URL after we log in as you

232
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:35,399
see right yeah basically generate that

233
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:39,079
one-time URL then maybe that's we don't

234
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,220
want the micro so long as you know I

235
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,689
know maybe this is if it can be done

236
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,490
with another key I guess the baby

237
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,440
doesn't belong here looks like Brian

238
00:14:44,490 --> 00:15:04,620
want this Brian wants to comment on this

239
00:14:46,440 --> 00:15:07,170
a part of my and if there any changes we

240
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,470
would want to make to the API to do that

241
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,329
that'd be good I mean the the JSON here

242
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,779
can be dynamically generated so it could

243
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:19,800
include a session ID in the URL we could

244
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:21,990
also have new keys that get registered

245
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,660
to specifically define a session ID that

246
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:28,589
is to be used on future connections

247
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,870
right the 7710 this URL could be per

248
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,420
client in DHT messages but it can't be

249
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,190
per client in an r/a correct

250
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,089
correct so I think it'd be better to do

251
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:41,360
that through the API so essentially the

252
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:44,780
next steps here are we really do want to

253
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,110
do inter up with portal vendors I think

254
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,360
the proposal to do a Interop of like the

255
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,590
the dummy case of a non captive network

256
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,360
is really good and we should do that

257
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:58,190
here at the ITF next time but if we have

258
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,970
people who are implementing captive

259
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:04,670
portals please reach out to us about

260
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,680
doing an interruptus I think that's kind

261
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,839
of the thing we need to do and then once

262
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,920
we have validated that I think we should

263
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:16,820
just kind of get these things out the

264
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:19,120
door that's it so yes maybe after

265
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:23,710
Brian's presentation we can talk about

266
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,840
what the next steps are so Ryan

267
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:32,210
disappeared briefly then you have the

268
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:44,000
floor great thanks so much all right

269
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:45,890
well it's a real pleasure - so thanks a

270
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,260
lot Mike my name is Brian shields I work

271
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,560
employing the wireless you're in Los

272
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,939
Angeles California

273
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,160
you make might be familiar with our

274
00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:00,470
Airport Wi-Fi but we're also big on

275
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,170
cellular and other technologies and

276
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,480
convention centers military bases and a

277
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:10,310
lot more and I've been working in blingo

278
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,680
since 2007 and also portal since then as

279
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,060
you probably you're well aware a lot has

280
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:21,110
changed since that year when the iPhone

281
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:23,750
came out and was a member of the

282
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:25,849
wireless broadband this alliance where

283
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,600
I'm representing today and I'll be

284
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:32,810
talking about the WPA and what we do in

285
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,250
projects especially little project and

286
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,139
how it would be a mutually beneficial

287
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,600
for it-- yes all right

288
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,550
especially hearing what you're all

289
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,740
talking about right now this is music to

290
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,530
my ears so if you can hang on in this

291
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:49,490
slide I'll go

292
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,040
over the WBA overall it's an alliance of

293
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,500
over 100 members it's a community of

294
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,930
network providers manufacturers and

295
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,540
technology providers I was established

296
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:02,150
in 2003 with the Charter of developing

297
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:06,470
seamless and interoperable services

298
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:08,270
across wireless technologies WBA was one

299
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:18,380
of the forces behind the widespread

300
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:20,450
adoption of the next slide this is a

301
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,690
quick overview of the work groups and

302
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,640
projects at the WEA the group serve

303
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,770
their groups focus on wireless

304
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:33,010
deployments and convergence ing IOT

305
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:36,080
technologies is roaming workgroups for

306
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:39,170
sharing customer access across our

307
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,570
networks and finally there's testing

308
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:46,730
interoperability group that's when the

309
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:48,770
captain or the project is based and I

310
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,410
know this many of that I have membership

311
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,200
that are already members of the WBA so

312
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:57,530
I'd like them to participate in the

313
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:04,150
program as well but we're also very

314
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:14,720
happy to work on the more information

315
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:16,970
membership so the Charter for the

316
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,550
workgroup a little bit more about the

317
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:23,630
the capital standards we've been active

318
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:26,389
for over a year since January 2017 when

319
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,720
we first want been working on a white

320
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:36,580
paper that that will document how

321
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,580
current operating systems by client OS X

322
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:52,640
versions operating systems and releasing

323
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:55,580
that to probably anybody contribute and

324
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,000
what we like document behavior as well

325
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,550
as the current vyasa in activity

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,370
onboarding process so that's going to be

327
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:11,180
part of the well then also out of that

328
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,560
on auditing that behavior we also want

329
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:18,740
to recommend improvements for the

330
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:21,610
clients and onboarding for an example of

331
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:27,530
one of the issues is on the next slide

332
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:31,580
so this is a diagram Oh diagram that

333
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:36,230
shows the captive portal flow kind of

334
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:39,580
overlay I operate the system and as you

335
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,890
can see it's obviously very fragmented

336
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,760
there's a lot of cases a target but a

337
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:51,650
different process I've mentioned earlier

338
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:53,690
for the postdoc issue where the portal

339
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:59,120
closes automatically on authentication

340
00:20:53,690 --> 00:21:08,630
on Android iOS and Mac OS it stays open

341
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:10,010
for post next I'm going to show you even

342
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,610
with some of the issues that were raised

343
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:20,120
in our work and that this is a short

344
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:33,020
presentation and we're finalizing and

345
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:35,570
right now in the final editing so three

346
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:41,480
of the main pressing issues first one is

347
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:43,669
a lot of different operating systems use

348
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,560
different you are eyes there reference

349
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:51,950
creates a management issue on the

350
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:55,220
operator side to whitelist the URIs as

351
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,320
well as any that are calling HDS they're

352
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,740
all well aware that this great stirred

353
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,290
up early for his smashers when the CA is

354
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,850
checked and just overall depend the

355
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,010
mental behavior creates a lot of like

356
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,149
collections but find ourselves how we

357
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,010
work around

358
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,350
also the fragment in use cases as I've

359
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,960
mentioned before difference between

360
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,669
Apple and Android and Windows

361
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,850
interpretations first off there is a

362
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,020
change and then just overall limited

363
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:27,969
features available

364
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:38,260
there's no way to trigger mode debugging

365
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:41,710
tools and there's no support on site

366
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:46,140
State management so we can't recognize

367
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:49,270
it and any user the first time I sent a

368
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:55,740
filling out a form for example and the

369
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:58,410
second time saying hey welcome back

370
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:11,050
we're gonna allow you to skip through

371
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:14,740
the initial the next line so how can we

372
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:18,280
collaborate so The WB's constituency is

373
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:22,000
one of our great strengths are where

374
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:32,950
manufacturers and providers technology

375
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:37,600
providers well we work out together this

376
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,910
is a short list we'd like to work out

377
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:46,209
possibly and rc4 near term usability

378
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:51,040
standards scope also I would like those

379
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:54,570
short term fixes or manufacturers and

380
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:59,350
we're really interested in 77 admist

381
00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:08,169
and its potential for solving a lot of

382
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:10,330
problems and I think it also set the

383
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,830
stage for a lot of new innovation and a

384
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:17,310
lot unlock a lot of new functionality

385
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,310
would add to a lot

386
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:28,668
and then also we want to make sure the

387
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:33,950
enterprise is included hotspot 2.0 and

388
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:37,999
you know to use cases of limited support

389
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:42,440
is starting to come through with you has

390
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:45,470
added support for this but the ability

391
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,720
to engage with the end user and the put

392
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,970
them on a path point network in the

393
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,440
enterprise would simplify a lot of

394
00:24:49,970 --> 00:25:00,980
onboarding for any place than any other

395
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:04,989
activity right we're in this is what we

396
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:08,269
do every day we want to improve the

397
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:14,289
experience for end users and streamline

398
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:20,179
access to the network without a lot of

399
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:23,499
friction so that pretty much covers

400
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:26,989
everything so I told you about charter

401
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:28,580
the captive portal workgroup highlights

402
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:36,889
of our activity and the issues move back

403
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:49,879
to work if anybody's interested in

404
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:53,508
joining WPA or we're doing right does

405
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:54,980
anyone have any questions for Brian have

406
00:25:53,509 --> 00:26:04,779
a better discussion about this and maybe

407
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:07,609
we can speaking which actually we were

408
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:10,429
we're writing code for 77 tenants as we

409
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:12,918
speak I think was last week so many was

410
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:14,749
during right curtains we sent to Colonel

411
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:19,639
a touch screen for the RA auction as

412
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:21,529
well but the you know I think a couple

413
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:23,330
things really one of them was is that is

414
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:27,109
the classification legacy behavior I

415
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:29,869
would not maybe spend too much on that

416
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:33,799
because it will be subject to change and

417
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:35,899
I think it's it's of not really

418
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,210
to characterize even even the behavior

419
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:39,799
amongst Android devices radically

420
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,899
different you know different OEMs have

421
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:44,269
different behaviors and so on I know I

422
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:45,918
would instead try to focus on how can we

423
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:49,159
make this better going forward

424
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,919
using some like proper API it's you know

425
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:54,769
I think 7710 is part of it one thing I

426
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,480
don't see here hotspot 2.0 is I think in

427
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:58,549
a much better shape one thing I don't

428
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,389
see here is the is the captive portal

429
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:05,330
API and I think that that is something

430
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:07,369
that it would be good if you to be

431
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,289
honest you know from a network

432
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:11,269
perspective we want to implement that

433
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:13,279
but we don't really have existence proof

434
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:16,669
of a network operator that can build it

435
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,649
and so until we do we're sort of not

436
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:20,840
sure what priority we need to assign to

437
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:23,570
it so I think if someone is willing to

438
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,070
sort of bring up some test write some

439
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,799
code and bring up something some test

440
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,559
environments we're happier to

441
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:34,460
collaborate on that you know so I think

442
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:40,149
the API would be really good to our come

443
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,149
together yeah thank you

444
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,409
Denmark ins since this is captive portal

445
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:48,200
for Wi-Fi are you recommending requiring

446
00:27:45,409 --> 00:28:00,159
our C 8110 to protect the Wi-Fi

447
00:27:48,200 --> 00:28:02,570
connection opportunistic encryption yeah

448
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,220
authenticate a third authenticate list

449
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,379
there's no authentication against

450
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,690
encryption of the wireless medium

451
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:11,350
between the station on the AP so that

452
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:13,759
you don't basically connect in the open

453
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,809
setup there's a nice Sun glint the

454
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,100
captive portal and then what you're

455
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:17,539
going to throw away all that nice

456
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,939
cryptographic state and go back and halt

457
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:22,700
the connection that can be added work

458
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,690
passively observed so Dan this is

459
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:30,559
probably something you can take up with

460
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:32,989
Brian I can yeah it's a good question

461
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:38,029
but I think we find that out some other

462
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:39,769
way tell me about the apples so thank

463
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:41,570
you for sharing this it's great to hear

464
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:43,159
that you are interested in helping test

465
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,470
this out and particularly what we're

466
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,970
talking about

467
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:51,320
7710 yes plus the API

468
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,210
you know as we were talking about for

469
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,750
next ITF it would be good to do a

470
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:59,029
experiment here on this network but it

471
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,580
would also be graded at the same time if

472
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:03,980
we could do some testing perhaps in the

473
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:08,629
hackathon perhaps over that kind of on

474
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:12,110
site with a captive portal network would

475
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:13,610
it be possible to have your site the

476
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,229
vendor like come and like bring a box

477
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:40,059
that has this implementer so we could

478
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:43,070
test this out at the hackathon brand-ne

479
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:45,049
any of your other you or your

480
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,350
collaborators collaborators have you had

481
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:50,059
a chance to read any of the API and

482
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,340
architecture and 77s documents and

483
00:29:50,059 --> 00:30:02,809
details do you have any feedback for the

484
00:29:52,340 --> 00:30:09,019
list in one of the fields actually in

485
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:20,418
the HCP option I assume that that point

486
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:23,629
to that is what 7777 ten bits clarifies

487
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:29,779
is that the option URL is to the API and

488
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:32,570
inside the API are further URLs to look

489
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:33,919
at it's just the trying to line some of

490
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,110
the requirements that we have

491
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,700
established in our whitepaper see if we

492
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:48,729
can get additions to the point there's a

493
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:48,730
little talk about again sweet these are

494
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:56,479
just reeling from the gentleman I think

495
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,720
you have somebody else from máxima they

496
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,430
also will Inc implements any seventeen

497
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:10,990
well it's really just really from the

498
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:17,620
mic thank you any other questions for

499
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:20,140
Brian thank you Brian is there a chance

500
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,699
we'll see you in Singapore there is a

501
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,650
chance I'm gonna go talk to my boss

502
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:31,330
right after this

503
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:35,620
great okay thanks Brian I think the next

504
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:39,429
item on our agenda is the open issues

505
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,810
that we have on the the architecture

506
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,460
document I just want to go through those

507
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,190
briefly we talked about most of these

508
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:48,940
last time we met but I think it's a good

509
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,930
opportunity for us to hopefully close

510
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:56,830
some of them or at least it you don't

511
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:59,670
need to worry about being logged in just

512
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,669
go to the architecture job

513
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:17,760
do we have suresh in the room he has

514
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:22,230
observers wonderful so our editor here

515
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:30,090
is occupied so let's just go through

516
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:33,150
these briefly hopefully I can understand

517
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:36,780
what the problems were I hope most of

518
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:44,820
these issues myself and sellers I make

519
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:51,420
it easier so one of the things that came

520
00:32:44,820 --> 00:33:09,360
up is that yeah I think we might need a

521
00:32:51,420 --> 00:33:12,660
controller superfast so some networks do

522
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,389
during the process of during the state

523
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,880
in which someone is captive still

524
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:21,390
provide access to DNS resolvers even

525
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,030
those that are outside the network that

526
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:27,960
won't necessarily be true for something

527
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:32,690
like dough or some of the other DNS

528
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,940
variants sometimes these networks allow

529
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,650
UDP on 53 but not TCP in 53 and all

530
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,080
sorts of other interesting combinations

531
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:46,350
at the same sort of problem the question

532
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:49,080
here is a what text we provide in the

533
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,840
document that around this this

534
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,790
particular class of problems and so the

535
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,689
only the problem here is making sure

536
00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:00,510
that the clients have the ability to

537
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:03,780
request the captive portal API document

538
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:05,580
and that requires name resolution and so

539
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,509
I think the suggestion was to disable

540
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:11,759
any of the external manually configured

541
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,380
resolvers no matter how you were

542
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:19,470
intending to interact with those

543
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:21,630
resolvers Martinez said it breaks every

544
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:22,540
time I go to captive portal and I can't

545
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,940
reach

546
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,040
even anything well this is true of the

547
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,150
current system but our system not in

548
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,630
this one necessary and so I think that I

549
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:36,520
think that we need to have the nice

550
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:38,440
thing that would be an SF is that I

551
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,110
don't mind if you intercept my packets

552
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,740
and answer them because I can validate

553
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,830
them myself

554
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:47,830
all right let's do the conversation for

555
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:50,889
tomorrow if we can well you can log in

556
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,330
if I use your DNS server library anyway

557
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,969
the point is that I have to reconfigure

558
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:57,490
everything use your DNS server and there

559
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:00,819
so I would like to have some some

560
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:03,520
statement that DNS SEC I should be able

561
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,200
if you put DNS SEC on your portal link I

562
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,509
should be able to validate it and that

563
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,500
means I need to access all the resolvers

564
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,420
above your knee all the 38 resolvers of

565
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,390
underneath not just your your recursive

566
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,840
resolver to get your the name of your

567
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,839
captive api

568
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:26,200
interesting ok so again it's okay if you

569
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,980
proxy my stuff as long as you return the

570
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,299
data correctly sign right michael

571
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,880
richards in the fight but it's also

572
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,380
possible that Deanna's over TLS and DNS

573
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,180
for AGVs may just be blocked by the

574
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,170
portal policy at some point so I think

575
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,790
there's no option but to use the

576
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,170
network's DNS servers during portal

577
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:48,550
validation I don't not sure that we can

578
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:52,660
say that the issue was made I mean I

579
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:54,610
think you know if if if let's say if the

580
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,870
captive portal operator forgets to block

581
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:03,130
you know 4 4 3 2 the VMS server then

582
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:04,660
it's sort of all falls over for me from

583
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,520
an implementation perspective to be

584
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,830
honest the simplest thing here is to say

585
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,880
look just use clear text CMS to this for

586
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:15,460
this to the network's DNS service you

587
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,010
know personally that seems the simplest

588
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,300
option I think if we if we require if we

589
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:23,830
require the name to be globally

590
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,690
reachable and resolvable by global dns

591
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:30,790
service that may make it more

592
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:33,700
complicated to deploy so you know I was

593
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,120
I was on a plane yesterday and of course

594
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,370
that the name isn't global

595
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,779
reachable so it brings the standard

596
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,100
captive portal flow but it doesn't rate

597
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,140
the captive portal up to the captive

598
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,759
portal app knows not to do this one

599
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,600
thing that I would oppose is do not

600
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,790
disable never say disable encrypted DNS

601
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,250
only say disable encrypted this for this

602
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,170
query right right and that's that's

603
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,610
going to be important it's it's only for

604
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:00,640
these queries that you might to be to

605
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:03,140
the API and potentially also to the

606
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,339
captive portal pages as well this is

607
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,930
going to make it really interesting for

608
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:13,490
those people are implementing the

609
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:15,200
browser today yeah a lot of things

610
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:18,009
breaking that in in these modes so

611
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,750
having some recommendation here

612
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:25,100
acknowledging the the complexities of

613
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:27,500
implementation might be wise Tommy so

614
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:30,620
yeah very much agree with Lorenzo's

615
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,060
comments and yeah I think we could

616
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,960
probably go as far as saying that when

617
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:38,360
you are doing the resolution of the API

618
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,310
and the connection to the API you kind

619
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:44,810
of must use the local infrastructure for

620
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:46,490
that and one way to think of this if

621
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:49,130
we're talking about like provisioning

622
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:51,560
domains and consistent sets of my DNS

623
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,920
plus my routing and other things when I

624
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,270
am doing something like DNS over TLS and

625
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,650
have an external server that I've

626
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:02,870
configured that's effectively a custom

627
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,340
PVD that's not purely local and so we

628
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:08,299
kind of just want to say that if you are

629
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:11,150
doing any connection to the captive API

630
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,610
or at this stuff he needs to be within a

631
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,990
purely local provisioning and doing just

632
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,450
use the local information don't try to

633
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,830
access anything else and that can and

634
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:21,230
should be separate from what other

635
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,460
applications are doing and that you

636
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,560
should allow applications to essentially

637
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,040
choose into the local config just for

638
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,040
this purpose

639
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,460
collagen pillage eggs just kind of like

640
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,980
some of the solutions have been posed to

641
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,230
this video file a the policy of now I

642
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,550
can run a VPN hidden over the DNS and

643
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,170
obviously we can't have a solution does

644
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:44,090
that or no one would really use it for

645
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,190
lots of the cases so yeah I think this

646
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,840
is recognizing that if you use the local

647
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,010
network infrastructure for this then

648
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,780
there's much less chance of

649
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:57,320
sorts of things happen at that C which

650
00:38:50,780 --> 00:39:00,790
is yeah consistent let's go the next one

651
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,790
oh I'll make a note in that in issued

652
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:29,740
yeah so I think this is this is again

653
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:31,749
just text in the document but there is

654
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,538
the possibility that a captive portal

655
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:39,609
might lie about certain things in order

656
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:41,710
to get people to go to web pages you

657
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:44,049
have enough Network but you advertise a

658
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:47,859
captive portal and say that someone's

659
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:49,390
captive when they're not I don't care

660
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:50,769
about this particular scenario and I've

661
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,348
heard from people in the past that this

662
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:55,089
scenario it doesn't bother them

663
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:58,809
particularly I'd like to confirm that

664
00:39:55,089 --> 00:40:02,549
though and then ask what we would write

665
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:02,549
down in this case

666
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,320
what would an operating system

667
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:36,400
implementer you maintain your current

668
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:38,410
connectivity chicks tummy can you

669
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,450
suggest some text for us or at least an

670
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,870
approach we might take you great well I

671
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,250
don't

672
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:46,150
one thing I was gonna propose this

673
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:47,080
approach is potentially not really

674
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,300
committing to what the implementation

675
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,870
needs to do innocence just essentially

676
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:56,500
say this can't happen

677
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:58,720
they can lie and implementations can

678
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,180
decide what to do about it they should

679
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,299
have some approach either by you know

680
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,680
doing the probes that are validating the

681
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,290
we could have an any number of

682
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,810
heuristics any number of ways to kind of

683
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,850
like that Hufford detect the people who

684
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,750
lie or flag them or allow the user to

685
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,400
say oh I don't

686
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,310
this network seems to be acting

687
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,410
strangely I don't think that's for this

688
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,320
document to be designed the solution to

689
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,839
and this is consistent with decisions

690
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,120
we've made in the past people do

691
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,780
whitelist the captive portal checks for

692
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,799
various operating systems and we

693
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,480
explicitly decided not to address that

694
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,810
so that I think this falls under that as

695
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:43,320
well so do we need a text change here I

696
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:46,750
think it might be worth acknowledging

697
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:53,410
the problem even if we don't do anything

698
00:41:46,750 --> 00:42:05,440
about you know maybe we shouldn't talk

699
00:41:53,410 --> 00:42:08,080
about nuisance Mike which isn't so if I

700
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,570
have a captive portal and my whitelist

701
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,450
everyone's MAC address that I like so

702
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:16,690
that they don't get any any restrictions

703
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:18,640
or my company for instance and I still

704
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:21,280
put this thing in there is that still a

705
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,620
nuisance I just want to say to the

706
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,450
people this network finally brought to

707
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,670
you by

708
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:32,439
is the API you're gonna say captive :

709
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:34,869
true or captive : false yeah so when you

710
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,819
get to the MDI I do that but in the

711
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:41,380
process of doing that I have something

712
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:42,849
that I can write do you think that it's

713
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,619
enough okay I just want to be clear that

714
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:53,140
I understood the problem here why people

715
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:54,790
calling it a nuisance all just just

716
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,828
wanted to clarify this section starts

717
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:59,558
with if a signaling protocol is

718
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:01,660
implemented and that something like

719
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,490
section is if it's implemented then

720
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:08,279
somebody can spoof the signal

721
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:10,180
yep that's right and so there's a risk I

722
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,099
don't think we have any plans at the

723
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,308
moment to specify what a signaling

724
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:20,980
protocol is so maybe this is less less

725
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:24,609
of a problem so I Michael again so I

726
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:27,730
think that maybe my confusion is that is

727
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:29,770
there advice that client operating

728
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,180
systems should because they've seen the

729
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:33,990
signaling protocol are going to do

730
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,490
things which they didn't need to do and

731
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,919
someone says Kappa true but they're not

732
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,359
really captive is that the that's

733
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:46,540
essentially what it takes to sign yeah

734
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:48,549
and and so and the advice is to to go

735
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,470
ahead anyway the network's working so

736
00:43:48,549 --> 00:44:06,099
far go ahead anyway don't you and don't

737
00:43:50,470 --> 00:44:07,839
don't bother the user so maybe we - then

738
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:11,280
I think we'll probably be able to

739
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,279
resolve this you told me

740
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:56,770
search for risk of nuisance yes Rahul

741
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,840
I'm trying to think of what what someone

742
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:01,869
saying captive force and steel

743
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,810
advertising URL would mean by that and

744
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:07,510
how how I could want to react to that if

745
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:12,279
if we're going to put up a notification

746
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:17,380
to to respond to who's advertise your

747
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:20,730
else then sometimes and if we don't do

748
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:24,760
that then I can easily see operators

749
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:29,770
putting that flag through saying yes yes

750
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,570
yes its captive just so this isn't this

751
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:35,290
is a risk web acknowledged I think in

752
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:37,630
the party it is always possible that the

753
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:40,690
network could be captive in some way

754
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:44,589
that you're not able to detect as well

755
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:46,750
so one of the problems here is that if

756
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:48,700
we try when we talked about this a

757
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,280
number of times in the past if we try to

758
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:55,629
capture every single way in which the

759
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,190
network policy might apply that says

760
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,490
that the the network is not completely

761
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:02,320
open so certain networks block access to

762
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,180
certain sites for instance and this is

763
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:08,109
something that happens on the country or

764
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:10,000
enterprise or whatever level basis do we

765
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:13,779
require that the captive portal signal

766
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:18,430
that it's it's a rathole that gets

767
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:20,490
really kind of nasty yeah yeah I think

768
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:22,720
in my personal opinion we might want to

769
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:27,490
remove the word nuisance and replace it

770
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:29,410
with a more apt description of some kind

771
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:34,899
none comes to mind just yet sorry say

772
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:43,270
again Michael yeah you just described it

773
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:46,270
more correctly in some way where does it

774
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:48,070
happen in 15 minutes it's got those last

775
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:57,640
issues done I will then talk about next

776
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:59,680
steps so this is yours Tommy I think

777
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:12,670
this is just editorial so let's move on

778
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:15,009
to the next one so again this might be

779
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,840
editorial there is the possibility that

780
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,270
someone might decide to move the

781
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:24,280
location at the API or one of the other

782
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:31,630
resources and yeah Lorenzo says good

783
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:33,220
luck to them well the API or any of the

784
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:37,840
URLs that are referenced from the API

785
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:41,169
and I think maybe we just not worry

786
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,550
about this one does anyone want to say

787
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,190
something about this particular problem

788
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:50,050
I know this came up in discussions last

789
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:54,880
year sometime we just do a street mean

790
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:57,550
I've seen it may happen and essentially

791
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:03,340
it will just have a goal did you guys

792
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:05,620
know reconnect so by saying by saying

793
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:08,290
nothing here we make the problem

794
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,420
something that the captive portal vendor

795
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,770
and the network need to address they

796
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:17,200
need to make sure that if they want to

797
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:19,900
put a new one in then retain the old one

798
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,850
as a working end point I think that's

799
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,760
probably a better way to do with this

800
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:29,860
particular problem

801
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:33,400
so technically within the URLs given out

802
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:36,640
by the API JSON those can change because

803
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,370
there is an expiry time that's listed

804
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,770
JSON so the clients can

805
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:44,350
wretch so you there is a limited amount

806
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:47,050
of times that is defined by the portal

807
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:49,060
that it needs to maintain old end points

808
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,500
and do that so that you can have a

809
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,080
fairly recent transition there I think

810
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,480
that so we can mention that to say that

811
00:48:53,080 --> 00:49:00,130
that's a way to change the your eyes of

812
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:02,620
actual resources changing the portal API

813
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,480
itself is I think for our basic than we

814
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,089
can just say if you really need to

815
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,740
change where things are pointing to

816
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:14,560
don't change the API that will be a

817
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:16,240
little bit more forensic walibi is there

818
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,890
any recommendation that the portal you

819
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,089
all right be the same program right it

820
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:24,339
is that explicit it said it says should

821
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:29,950
be the user portal no you means that

822
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:31,690
even the API you might want to say that

823
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,589
I think we probably should because of

824
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,200
the RA case

825
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:41,440
yeah yeah but I mean somebody who

826
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:42,790
changes this you know well they're gonna

827
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,750
have a lot of interoperability problems

828
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:48,820
so you know might want to say that it's

829
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,080
my want to say it's not recommended you

830
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,510
just say it should be stable for the

831
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:56,230
lifetime of clients association with

832
00:49:52,510 --> 00:50:15,850
them probably I don't know what this you

833
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:19,620
should even be of ships I think some

834
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:22,660
terms of next steps here we are looking

835
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:25,450
hopefully with suresh help to address

836
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:29,680
these issues in another within the next

837
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:33,220
little while and then we have three

838
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,850
documents we have no issues on those

839
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:39,399
three documents with we seem to have

840
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:43,480
agreement on the way forward on all of

841
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:46,060
the issues that we do have expect to

842
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,910
work in group last call when these

843
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:51,430
documents are updated does anyone have

844
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:53,649
any objections to going

845
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:57,879
to that step once we once we're done

846
00:50:53,650 --> 00:51:01,690
here I would like to get some more eyes

847
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:06,940
on the 7710 document because that one's

848
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:08,650
a little fresher so maybe a show of

849
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,869
hands from folks in the room who are

850
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:16,119
willing to read and review that and your

851
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:21,579
you will get in the minutes I see a few

852
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:25,059
oh thanks yeah we have a few okay so -

853
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:36,420
check would you can you capture names we

854
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:50,160
I saw Ted back there as well I can't see

855
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:52,599
and anything else I thank you all for

856
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:57,210
your contributions and we'll let the

857
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,210
ster group take the time

858
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,150
[Music]

859
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:55,380
I'll take the action item of writing up

860
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:57,359
the request to to the NOC and maybe I'll

861
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,590
put it on github and put it on the list

862
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,000
ask for comments and we'll just kind of

863
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:03,080
revise that doc including all the things

864
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,080
operationally we expect

865
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:24,599
[Music]

866
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:31,569
