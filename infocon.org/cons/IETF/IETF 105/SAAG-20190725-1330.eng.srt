all right with that let's roll

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,580
thanks to all the work groups that sent

27
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,800
their information to sag we're gonna

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,109
quickly skip through the ones that have

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,728
reported if you want to follow along you

30
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,200
could obviously go to the sag mailing

31
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,390
lists archive or in the slide

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,440

to report negative okay moving forward

43
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,170
suit met no report anything that needs

44
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,380
to be said at the mic we sent her for

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,019
five minutes before the meeting so it is

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,970
out there now the only thing that we

47
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,820
could add that's not in there is the

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,170
chief working group has consensus to

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,850
take a dependency on the suit working

50
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,350
group and the rats working group for

51
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,459
that matter and so that's just an inter

52
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,560
working with the may be of interest to

53
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,620
people that suit and breasts out have a

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,390
customer which is us as teeth perfect

55
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:33,920
courageously work in collaboration

56
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:39,980
across the areas there's steep TLS

57
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:44,790
anything you say about tok behind okay

58
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:47,010
trans well this is one issue left again

59
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,350
we've been saying it's like five IDF's

60
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,370
now and this time it's pcp 190 and how

61
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,019
it affects the the trans URI hopefully

62
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,180
this will get resolved in the next

63
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,440
couple of weeks and then we'll send RFC

64
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,050
and close a working group again

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,880
hopefully and so they've got some

66
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:10,860
discussion going on at the art area

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:13,049
mailing list that's right okay there are

68
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,979
quite a few other activities that happen

69
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,750
across the IETF their SEC related Viet

70
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,608
this is a partial list probably not a

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:32,790
complete list if anyone wants to come up

72
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:35,700
to the mic to comment on any of those hi

73
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,070
this is Elliott I think I would just put

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,180
ops Harry working group on the list in

75
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,940
terms of we're doing a lot of mud

76
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,700
expansion and one of the particular

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,400
pieces of work that we'll be looking for

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,169
guidance on is that there's a mud

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,539
reporter draft out there which would

80
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,690
which is ARF like that might generate

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,229
reports back to manufacturers there are

82
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,729
obviously privacy considerations

83
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,469
throughout all this and you know it's a

84
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,830
very nation draft we're still trying to

85
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,800
figure out

86
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,450
what's going on and so over time I want

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,190
people to just keep an eye on that one

88
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:13,469
for us oh yeah sorry there's no like

89
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,910
real monitor speaker pointing at us I'm

90
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,320
not sure if everybody heard the name of

91
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:27,000
the working group that that's going on

92
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:34,310
opps AWG when they Seltzer w3c we will

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:39,080
send an update and if you were in the

94
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:43,590
paired research trip yesterday you heard

95
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,270
Pete from brave speaking about some work

96
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:51,719
in privacy considerations and

97
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:54,450
specifications between w3c and IETF I

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,840
invite folks who are interested in those

99
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:00,960
issues at the web application layer to

100
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,080
come over and check out things that w3c

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,200
is doing in our privacy interest group

102
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,760
and in our web application security and

103
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,760
web authentication working groups

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,539
thank you ever under external related

105
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,989
another organization is itu-t study

106
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,730
group 17 which sent a liaison or a sent

107
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,200
multiple of them to the teeth working

108
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,370
group they're doing related work and

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,930
fortunately we have overlap and

110
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,330
participants wherever the editors if the

111
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,060
documents come to IETF participate thank

112
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,010
you tuck and so right now we believe

113
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,480
that we are aligned but it is an

114
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:43,320
external activity that we are tracking

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:45,810
from with an 84 thing group and this is

116
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,820
Linda Deborah from future way for the

117
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,460
external related to work

118
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,770
there's the Owen ug open network user

119
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,349
group there's a software-defined

120
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,549
security services is related to security

121
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:02,880
service for the hybrid cloud and also

122
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:05,580
for the IETF in the routing area we had

123
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,730
a IDR has quite a few

124
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,000
contributions related to how to do

125
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,040
controller of PGP to distribute IPSec

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,520
parameters so that was related to

127
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,520
security

128
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:25,680
like you want me to mention the Netcom

129
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,810
for sure actually okay rich sauce net

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,970
comp has got a draft out for crypto

131
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,970
types and actions and monitoring and so

132
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:35,190
on and anyone who's implemented any kind

133
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,910
of cryptography will look at it and

134
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,160
Blanche

135
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:43,560
so I encourage everyone to look at it

136
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:50,340
and Blanche or expert or do whatever you

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:55,110
need to do I want to mention the buff

138
00:07:50,340 --> 00:08:01,650
that we've had this ITF Lake buff those

139
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:03,270
who weren't there sure there's been at

140
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,359
the start was quite pessimistic and

141
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,490
think that the content was the dirtiest

142
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,270
we have a group of people wanting to

143
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,880
work on this it's about creating a

144
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:19,169
lightweight authenticated key exchange

145
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,729
for using IOT specifically requirements

146
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:25,710
that came out of the Oscar working group

147
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:28,650
and well the people in the room were

148
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,260
kind of split among people wanting to do

149
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,880
something very narrowly tailored to the

150
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,870
Oscar working group and people who

151
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,120
wanted to do something more by burning

152
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,839
and of course we already have two

153
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,230
suggested solutions for solving this

154
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,839
even though the requirements are not

155
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,310
down yet so since that towards enough

156
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,400
enthusiasts in to form a working group

157
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,729
I'm not sure that this scope is hammered

158
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:01,829
down enough to do the so I guess that's

159
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,810
what the eighties now yeah yes / for the

160
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,550
eighties thank you you've and Steven for

161
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,099
chairing that working group we were

162
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,109
excited to see a lot of enthusiasm the

163
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,140
the problem around an ache is understood

164
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,600
and we were excited to see enthusiasm

165
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,670
around both Oscar and a broader kind of

166
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,170
solution but we have some kind of tough

167
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,029
choices to think I've had about how to

168
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,500
actually proceed so for those that

169
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,390
participated kind of thank you for the

170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,110
input to stay tuned on how we're gonna

171
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,110
do next steps

172
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,960
okay so that one's to the end of our

173
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,480
planned updates and gets us to talking

174
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,880
about our invited talks so I invite Dirk

175
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:58,280
to come up and we're gonna talk about

176
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:58,280
kid lock related issues so thank you to

177
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,210
era director sent to the chairs for

178
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,720
giving us the chance to present our

179
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:09,180
activity here on behalf of Pettit who

180
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,540
could not make it to Montreal and my

181
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,050
name is Stefano go and we have this

182
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:19,890
activity for some quite time was varying

183
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:26,520
participation of people in the IDF

184
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:30,199
community and the yeah I try to describe

185
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:34,130
what we were heading for and try to

186
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:37,310
explain why we are interested in

187
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:41,070
identify a locator split or separation

188
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:44,030
approaches and why we think that common

189
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,220
privacy consideration on the different

190
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:51,300
solutions which are available could be

191
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:56,250
of interest and would like to see some

192
00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:00,240
reaction comments and how to proceed how

193
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:03,210
to focus yeah okay

194
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,360
first we'll start Morris on explaining

195
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:09,360
what we think is meant with this

196
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,480
identifier locator separation and then

197
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,860
also on privacy which always comes up I

198
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,880
think if we talk about identifiers which

199
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,940
could yeah harm the users privacy and

200
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,150
also yes there was a technical linear

201
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,330
also on privacy and a lot of activity

202
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:33,750
and the sick area is on privacy issues

203
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:36,209
we see some use cases where this should

204
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:40,940
be especially interesting and perhaps

205
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:43,280
may come up more than in past

206
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,300
okay the solution space is perhaps too

207
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,579
early we there are some approaches but

208
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,620
we first want to see what are really the

209
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,140
problem what's the purpose statement and

210
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,830
where what are the requirements we have

211
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:02,630
to fulfill and after that it's time for

212
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:05,720
the next step so with a traditional

213
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,820
approach routing between two IP

214
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,220
addresses for an session between two

215
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:15,470
endpoints identified with by their IP

216
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:20,420
address this is working fine in entrant

217
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:23,780
transparency more or less but in some

218
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:27,250
cases Mittman may not be enough

219
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,360
efficient maybe too complex too much

220
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,630
encapsulation and decapsulation and

221
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,500
tunneling and D tunneling and things and

222
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:40,189
for instance one of the UK's mobility

223
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,280
high speed mobility extreme ability with

224
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,260
the IP addresses or they point of

225
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,350
attachments changing very rapidly and

226
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,890
the session above cannot survive perhaps

227
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,200
the change of the endpoints so some

228
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,330
applications needed so there could be

229
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,660
one problem and of course also moody

230
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:03,530
homing multipath transparency when you

231
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,150
bind several paths and transport packets

232
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,790
over different paths and have to

233
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,520
recollect it different IP addresses and

234
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:15,500
to the session cannot live with us or

235
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:19,430
need some more circumvention for to

236
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,730
solve this and then also this issue with

237
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:25,160
cloud and with physical entities which

238
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,960
are distributed but have one logical or

239
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:32,719
virtual identity entity and with their

240
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,970
identity and we think that this is

241
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,840
something where a separation of the

242
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:41,650
identity and the locator and using this

243
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:46,250
the identity as the end point with

244
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:48,709
changing locators which are bound to the

245
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,360
identity more or less as the different

246
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,690
approaches are available but this

247
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,860
approach generally may be an advantage

248
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,230
here and

249
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,370
could as these help to survive the

250
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,680
session so yes this is there are

251
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,340
multiple protocols and solutions and

252
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:12,050
RFC's available only to mention here

253
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:14,530
lisp with not only RFC 6830 3 this is

254
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,810
the control pain part but there's all

255
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:21,050
6830 for the data plan or user plane

256
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:24,680
part then we have Ireland PE which came

257
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:30,949
out of research group activities they

258
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:34,849
are for instance our C 6740 and then

259
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:38,690
there's also proposed by Tom Abbott with

260
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:42,920
ila identify located addressing which is

261
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:46,400
in draft status and they all of course

262
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:50,390
care for their security and privacy by

263
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:56,000
themselves and have solutions but they

264
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:58,520
are not yet or not deployed in a large

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,600
scale of course they are experimental or

266
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:05,680
also least was going for sendeth or

267
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,850
there are multiple deployments

268
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,780
implementations they are and small scale

269
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:17,780
deployments on ila also for for

270
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:21,170
databases but yes there's not yet an

271
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:24,410
operator who uses this approach for its

272
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,500
network and to have this approach

273
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:31,520
largely not as an overlay over another

274
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,130
overlay also it would be I think kind of

275
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,260
ideal a solution of course we need

276
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,670
something purchase also practical and

277
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,230
that's what we want to yeah that's the

278
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,660
way we want to proceed to see whether

279
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,300
there is something on common ground of

280
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:52,670
different approaches perhaps kind of a

281
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:57,439
more alight solution which of course

282
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,880
nevertheless serves the same advantages

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,810
for this for what these ID lock

284
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,600
approaches have been proposed so to

285
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:09,880
reduce the burn of the ipv6 or ABI

286
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:13,420
address which is normally

287
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:18,320
handling both the identity and the

288
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:21,130
location which is for instance for the

289
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,399
virtual machines with their different

290
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:28,370
locations for the same identity would be

291
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,190
helpful and then new network

292
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,329
architecture is required for them for

293
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:38,870
police that's it I would say a kind of

294
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:41,209
totally new architecture of course can

295
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,449
provide all this seamless mobility and

296
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:48,560
so and of course also thus mapping very

297
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:51,920
fine and but it's for an operator not

298
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,560
yet I've not seen one who assess yes we

299
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,540
deploy this in our network because we

300
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,000
see that it's viable yeah so the net

301
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:05,299
magnetic bearing systems can of course

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
be used ENS for some but also own

303
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:12,650
mapping systems instead of routing

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,990
cables to look up for and yeah and all

305
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,799
this approaches were you know what the

306
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:23,480
source destination identifier is carried

307
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:26,619
in in the header to find the right

308
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,610
location for the packet or a tribute to

309
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:34,820
instead of the IP address in a useful

310
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,879
manner okay but what you see especially

311
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,059
as the applications areas is now

312
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,809
industrial iot with a small messages and

313
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:47,990
the could be a large large head us much

314
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:52,010
more larger than the payload where such

315
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:54,380
an you not you but then if their depth

316
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,049
that approach could help and of course

317
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:01,070
also vehicle and networks where they're

318
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:06,799
all the us are moving the entity

319
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:08,450
endpoint at entities and they very

320
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,770
frequently change of course their

321
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:17,540
location and what what all is included

322
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,908
in 5g maybe mobile network with wireless

323
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,009
and fixed network access technology all

324
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:26,039
combined together

325
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:29,159
these are all areas where this ID

326
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:34,590
location would apply nicely to but also

327
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:37,789
again the privacy issue has to be solved

328
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:42,238
it has to be considered enough so that

329
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:49,559
there is no new privacy risk when using

330
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:51,779
this and I would like to go shortly on

331
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,059
the different approaches which I

332
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:58,859
mentioned which are available so the

333
00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:02,609
list protocol is as an SOS approach uses

334
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:04,678
an extra mapping system and encapsulate

335
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:07,799
the packets Tunnel set between list

336
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,909
domains and can also of course interact

337
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:15,929
with non these demands but the new list

338
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:19,259
architecture course could be a burden

339
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:22,919
for deploying it into an a running

340
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:26,489
system ok there are of course you does

341
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:31,979
specified new entities which do all this

342
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:33,719
and as usual if you have the identifier

343
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:36,989
and you need the locator you have to

344
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:39,059
query the mapping system but only if

345
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:42,659
it's necessary of course if it's not

346
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:45,299
changing you need not vary again so

347
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:48,479
that's not noted no only the overhead if

348
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,879
you guys is required for instance if you

349
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:53,399
flow is transmission direct formation is

350
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:59,459
starting or if the locator is changing

351
00:19:53,399 --> 00:20:02,939
and there are ok different RFC's and

352
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:07,259
updates to this RFC's now are under ASG

353
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,849
evolution evaluations sorry as proposed

354
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:11,279
standard instead of experimental and

355
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:14,249
there are of course more information on

356
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,320
the dispersed net for existing

357
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:21,659
deployments and also cost for the least

358
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:25,049
working group information the I N and P

359
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:28,710
approach can be more seen as a host

360
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:31,849
based approach the IP address is split

361
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,049
into the locator and note identify a

362
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:35,669
locator of course is something which is

363
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:38,160
significant for the

364
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:41,280
topology and issues for fathering and

365
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,610
routing and the identifier is the

366
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,059
notable naming the note which may be

367
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:53,129
physical but logically note and normally

368
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:55,530
does not change and yeah what is the

369
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,470
advantage it does not require any hooter

370
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,990
changes no new route us are required for

371
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,110
this and it uses ENS the existing

372
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:08,460
mapping system but of course this is

373
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:12,918
perhaps not a good idea if we have very

374
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:16,770
frequent queries for the mapping system

375
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,720
of course DNS is also evolving and Salim

376
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,299
who could not make it here has someone

377
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,610
else in the hackathon on Saturday an

378
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:28,139
implementation working with extensions

379
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:31,918
yeah and also there has been a tutorial

380
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,470
on Island P and meeting 102 and of

381
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,840
course then there's a website for Island

382
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:44,450
P implementations and the ILA based

383
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:47,129
approach use to transform addresses also

384
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:51,360
to split the existing IP address into

385
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:55,890
the identifier and locate apart or 64

386
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:59,668
five bit and it can have a mapping table

387
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:03,240
to look up and determine which locator

388
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:07,490
is fitting the identifier edges required

389
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,950
and this has been deployed and

390
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:14,760
commercially already on IP layer and

391
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:16,860
there are also limitations available you

392
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:21,990
know it's a little so it's this is all

393
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:24,719
which is working and special advantages

394
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:28,440
that the upper layer UDP and we did not

395
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:32,460
did not don't need to change when using

396
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,559
ila and there has been in one coffin il

397
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,950
a worse there's more information also on

398
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,690
the link even there so that's what I

399
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:44,940
want to say they all have of course

400
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:47,820
their own privacy considerations but but

401
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,140
what we think is required if we want to

402
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,770
go for a solution

403
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:56,130
which is deployed by an operator it

404
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:58,920
could be something a mix of all our a

405
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,290
new approach at least with preps new

406
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:06,840
requirements to privacy and that's what

407
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:10,620
we want to get to investigate yeah and

408
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:15,929
this I think that what I wanted to

409
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,729
conclude in this slide so why is the

410
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,490
privacy important of course because this

411
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,060
identify us in the packet header have to

412
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:26,840
be transported anyhow to pursue you use

413
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:30,149
it for routing odds also and if there is

414
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,270
yeah there there are chances to to break

415
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:37,490
the privacy if they are transported you

416
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:41,070
clear so just generally so and and the

417
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:46,760
that's also kind of a threat

418
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:50,220
and and there of course I would pull

419
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,460
versions of prior privacy leaks over the

420
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:57,750
location itself may be preached and may

421
00:23:53,460 --> 00:24:01,230
be available to others who are not

422
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,880
allowed to you need to know it and not

423
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,670
only the location but also of course the

424
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,540
movement and I come in combining

425
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:13,590
different information this can lead to

426
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:17,730
two new risks and of course also that

427
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:20,310
was something which moody party CP

428
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:23,280
Marcello pointed out that if we have

429
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,919
multiple paths that is also the privacy

430
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,960
risk because there are multiple

431
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:31,110
informations more than one location and

432
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,120
may lead or result in more precise

433
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:39,530
location information for the adverse

434
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:44,219
user which needs should not do it yeah

435
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:48,570
okay we there have been as a set of

436
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,670
solutions proposals already for and and

437
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,540
they have their own solutions as well in

438
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:58,170
this person Island P and also for ila

439
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:00,300
here only in a draft status moment but

440
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,360
the question is why has not been

441
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,389
deployed so far

442
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:10,729
yeah the question is privacy of course

443
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:13,850
may be one of the reasons but the the

444
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:16,850
deployment itself that ID lock systems

445
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:19,459
are not deployed in networks today is

446
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:23,510
some other reason of your architecture

447
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:26,059
you need of new components you need so

448
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,010
you have to change a lot and operators

449
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:31,129
are not willing to change something if

450
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,740
they are not true about the positive

451
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:37,399
outcomes out we also have to point on

452
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:39,590
the advantage of it of course and one

453
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:43,699
approach may be that the mapping system

454
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:47,470
perhaps is not so complicated so looking

455
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:51,309
for a new mapping system may be one way

456
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:54,260
but we are not not yet sure about this

457
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:59,210
but therefore we see there's a lot of

458
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:02,539
potential work we see and we want to get

459
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,590
done and are looking for people to join

460
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:07,158
us

461
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:09,889
we call it hit lock privacy in identify

462
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:14,059
a locator little approaches we have a

463
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:20,090
mailing list and have been since you

464
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:24,379
have menu since I give 102 and if we

465
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:28,010
have clear what is our focused problem

466
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:31,580
statement which we can actually solve we

467
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,649
would like to go for above because

468
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,090
besides the problem statement would be

469
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:38,120
interesting to start with our

470
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:41,029
requirements rafts and based on the use

471
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,279
cases we have identified and eventually

472
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:48,370
we find working group where the work has

473
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:52,760
been done or we get a new working group

474
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:57,139
created for this to do then the actual

475
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,750
work on solution space and I think don't

476
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:01,250
know what's the time but we have time

477
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:05,870
for a few have time for a few questions

478
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:08,840
yeah and then the other slides are just

479
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:11,178
for pick up I available in the

480
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,309
Proceedings of you can look it up there

481
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:16,100
and you can join the mailing list there

482
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:19,820
of course and

483
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,459
and review our drafts which we have up

484
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,330
to now in a very draft status also

485
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:31,489
published yeah I understand I would be

486
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:32,178
happy to answer questions or get feel

487
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:35,509
dangerous

488
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:38,869
oh gosh : um is there a reason to

489
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:40,639
believe these problems are soluble sorry

490
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:44,539
is there a reason to believe these

491
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:45,978
problems are soluble sigh so you have a

492
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,809
requirements you have a problem

493
00:27:45,979 --> 00:28:18,559
statement do you have any proposed

494
00:27:47,809 --> 00:28:22,690
solutions yeah this approach by a by a

495
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:26,359
Tom how about the on and fast on the

496
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,399
firewall and service tickets this is a

497
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,619
draft he has published so what that

498
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,498
would be one thing we could discuss but

499
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:35,988
we still think we have to start over

500
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:38,840
more or less with a real problem

501
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:39,979
statement before we go into shortage

502
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,389
my husband was trying to figure out if

503
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:47,599
this is a research problem or an

504
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:50,928
engineering problem research Eliot there

505
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:53,539
I was I would just add on to what occur

506
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:55,729
just said which is I could envision this

507
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:57,679
problem occurring not just unless the

508
00:28:55,729 --> 00:29:01,419
Nile NP but you could consider it in the

509
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,190
context of basic 802 dot dot one VLANs

510
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:06,049
you could look at it there's an analog

511
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:10,340
to this that you could address in the

512
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:12,019
context of MPLS VPNs and so I guess

513
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,080
there's a granularity issue and I think

514
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:17,509
it is an interesting research problem

515
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,210
but I don't know exactly where you'd

516
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:23,269
like to define the granularity as to how

517
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,529
you want to solve it and having a having

518
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:27,070
a little bit more clarity on that would

519
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,070
be very helpful

520
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,899
let's alternate mics please I'm sorry

521
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:37,129
it's alternate mics but if you'd like to

522
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,130
answer sure if you'd like to comment

523
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:44,100
research problem yeah we actually we

524
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:46,439
still see it also as a research problem

525
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,570
but also we want to have it yeah a

526
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,850
solution which is viable also for a

527
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:55,710
deployment so I think it's perhaps a

528
00:29:50,850 --> 00:30:00,928
combination of both hi my name is Tim

529
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:03,480
Shepherd and there was one uuugh named

530
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:05,400
several identifier locators what systems

531
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,370
but the one that I was most fond of and

532
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,350
I think it's 10 plus or minus five years

533
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,860
ago in the IETF there was some work on

534
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,360
hip host identity Palin and I didn't if

535
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,830
you mentioned that I think can you talk

536
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,250
a little bit louder that it's really

537
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,990
hard for us to hear on stage it's like

538
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,770
I'm hearing a lot of myself come back

539
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:29,250
from the rabbit so 10 or 10 plus or

540
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:32,820
minus 55 years ago there was a lot of

541
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:36,200
work on hip h IP and i don't think you

542
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:41,428
mentioned it as your examples of things

543
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,710
that's fine there's yeah but one one of

544
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:45,360
the thing one of the things I remember

545
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:50,010
from its story was that you could have a

546
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,500
femoral hits in that system and the idea

547
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,660
was you could create them so oh and now

548
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,419
bob was coming to the microphone I think

549
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,010
he was the originator of hip anyway I

550
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:03,049
just wanted to point you at that

551
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,049
something you might want to also look at

552
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:11,990
should the other mic now I'm ran a

553
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,189
concern and Island P is my work in

554
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,730
collaboration with Selim baki at the

555
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:20,760
University of st. Andrews and I don't

556
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:25,080
think I'll NP particularly has any

557
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:29,100
unique problems in this area the same

558
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:32,909
techniques in RFC 49:41 that are used to

559
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,699
generate ipv6 privacy addresses those

560
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:40,570
same techniques can be used with il NP

561
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,950
as is with the current Island PRF CS and

562
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,779
with the current aisle and P

563
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:51,340
implementations so it's unlike slide 11

564
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:53,080
up there island piece just leverages the

565
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,070
solution work that's already been done

566
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,049
to mitigate these risks with ipv6 and we

567
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,799
don't need any special magic sauce

568
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:05,379
that's Island be unique so now okay I

569
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,309
don't want to question this that is its

570
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,990
own security measures and privacy

571
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:13,928
countermeasures but Ireland P is also

572
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,690
not deployed by operators and I think we

573
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:20,710
have to look for something which is more

574
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:25,750
easily to be deployed and preps raising

575
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:30,220
new issues thank you you can take Rob

576
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:34,269
next we're just gonna Thomas who is a

577
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:38,139
she consulting the hipster except when I

578
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:40,799
can hit by car my hip I'm a lurker on

579
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:44,110
these lists I filed along doing it

580
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,820
aspects of hip and hip bone are very

581
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,039
similar to some of the issues being done

582
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:51,309
here I'll note that I have a work

583
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:52,779
project on a privacy based exchange and

584
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:54,970
I have a customer who wants me to get

585
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:57,340
moving on it already and a few other

586
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,889
things so there are things that we hit

587
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,809
with it's long lived identities which

588
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:04,629
are definitely could be considered

589
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:06,190
privacy issue there is work soon

590
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:09,399
starting which would be addressing on

591
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:12,490
the privacy issues with with hip just as

592
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:14,018
an aside but I've been lurking long and

593
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:18,549
of tennis on the sign meeting so that

594
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:20,529
the guys know me and I know them okay

595
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:25,168
would you like to have post this comment

596
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:32,049
on our mailing list that would be nice

597
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:34,750
okay thank you Robin Wilson I'm glad to

598
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:36,700
see this work being considered because

599
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:40,710
the more we think about privacy the more

600
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,940
we realize the importance of protecting

601
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:47,679
data that's at the infrastructure layer

602
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:49,990
and is very hard to obfuscate so that

603
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,850
the fact that privacy considerations are

604
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,670
high on the list is in my view a plus

605
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:57,520
point I think it's also valid to ask

606
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,920
whether or not there's a solution to

607
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,280
this problem but only if we also

608
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,950
recognize that solution is not

609
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,199
necessarily a binary thing there may be

610
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:13,389
degrees of mitigation of the risks this

611
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:19,779
involves okay thank you

612
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:22,000
I think we should consider this hi this

613
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,920
is science you mentioned that some of

614
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,830
those solutions are being used in the

615
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,060
IOT space and industrial IOT and I was

616
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,790
wondering whether you could shed some

617
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:35,460
light on on this topic shake what

618
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:38,620
explain what your experiences with that

619
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:42,280
IOT or deployment of those technologies

620
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:45,609
in the industrial IOT space okay yeah we

621
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,660
we have okay some some text on this in

622
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:51,640
the draft but I think we should

623
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:54,489
investigate more on existing solutions

624
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,980
and if you can point to some would be

625
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:59,259
great so as you you're asking if they're

626
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,890
like our existing deployments of this in

627
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,540
IOT

628
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,490
because that's a little from the

629
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,450
previous from one of the slides I got

630
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,270
the impression that there's some

631
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:12,970
deployment of this in IOT environments

632
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:14,860
and that's why I'm asking because III

633
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:20,290
can't contribute something in this space

634
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:22,120
because I don't know not you know the

635
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,700
problem is really really hard because

636
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,710
sometimes you simply transfer the prom

637
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,189
to someplace else

638
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:34,000
your transport numbers the long-lived

639
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:35,740
ESP spies long-lived how do you deal

640
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,720
with those things yet if you address you

641
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,459
fix the address you're only doesn't

642
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,490
remove the prompt is somewhere else and

643
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,930
some other layer of the protocol so

644
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,620
there's still a lot of work to be done

645
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,629
here

646
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,060
and looked at very carefully that you

647
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,410
you think you solve the problem but you

648
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,150
won't evolve what you think is the

649
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:56,500
obvious problem and there's just this

650
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:58,450
other one lurking there as well so it's

651
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,280
still very much a research EEPROM in my

652
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,930
opinion

653
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,200
yeah and that also gets back into a lot

654
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:07,460
of work from the technology plenary

655
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,250
yesterday

656
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,830
this adeno lispers dotnet i have won

657
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,420
some experience with a deployment of

658
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:21,690
industrial iot it uses list with ipv6

659
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:25,020
cia's their crypto e ids because it has

660
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,940
a association with a key pair and we use

661
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:32,900
encryption at the data plane to solve

662
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:34,350
the privacy issues okay thank you all

663
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,020
right perfect

664
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:39,630
thank you so much ok thank you for the

665
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:47,730
comments and trips you have a look at

666
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:49,860
our mailing list and thank you so next

667
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:53,030
up on the agenda we're gonna switch over

668
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,350
URI or Steven or gonna talk to us about

669
00:36:53,030 --> 00:37:06,240
exploring whether we need to extend the

670
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:09,799
internet threat model so the IIb had a

671
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,109
workshop there months ago in helsinki

672
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,750
about deployment realities versus design

673
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,100
expectations and two of the submissions

674
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,820
were these drafts that you and i have

675
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:24,200
written in pen utley we may emerge

676
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,130
stylish if depending what happens I

677
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,200
essentially asking the question and

678
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,610
there's some we re presented this at the

679
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,930
routing area working group earlier in

680
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:34,860
the week and we had a quick discussion

681
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:37,620
with the IBM isg about it so if you look

682
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,540
at 35 52 that kind of describes the

683
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:42,390
internet an internet model that we kind

684
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,009
of used when designing protocols and the

685
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,620
interesting part says two things the

686
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,850
first one essentially is that we assume

687
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,220
that an attacker has complete control

688
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,860
the network and that leads us to

689
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,560
generate all sorts of COMSEC protocols

690
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:58,170
and to want to turn on concept becomes

691
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,330
like mechanisms in protocols the second

692
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,490
thing it says is that we assume the end

693
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,610
systems engaging in the protocol have

694
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,220
not themselves being compromised and I

695
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,140
guess what we what we think is that

696
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,879
thing one is still absolutely necessary

697
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,480
we shouldn't consider weakening that or

698
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,730
doing silly things in that space but

699
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,030
thing to may no longer be sufficient or

700
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:22,300
maybe it doesn't matter yeah

701
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:24,730
anymore and this is perhaps something

702
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,430
worth looking at I guess I mean I would

703
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,590
say that in the you know in defense of

704
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:31,690
3552 it may well be the case that as

705
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:33,190
soon as you go beyond what it says you

706
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,450
run into problems that are so hard

707
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,910
there's very little you can do about it

708
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,740
so this may be a problem that's a bit

709
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,290
too hard or maybe there's things we can

710
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,520
do so again looking at thing two and

711
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,910
thinking about comparing it to the

712
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,710
current reality if we get better COMSEC

713
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,720
as was all the thing one then that

714
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,400
motivates attackers to look elsewhere so

715
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,730
they you know keys under doormats kind

716
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,840
of things or all those kind of stuff

717
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,910
surveillance I think has been an issue

718
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:01,660
we've talked about from from the point

719
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:03,460
of view of three-letter agencies but

720
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,930
also in the real world today there's

721
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,120
this kind of surveillance capitalism

722
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,109
that kind of generates new risks because

723
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,080
of the breath the collection of

724
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:12,520
information the fact is that this is

725
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,069
essentially unavoidable if you're using

726
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,290
the Internet today and family wrote 35

727
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,960
50 to the Internet was a pretty

728
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:23,620
different place I think it's also true

729
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,050
that even for a network that you think

730
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,509
isn't really vulnerable even if that's

731
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,250
true at a particular point in time some

732
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,350
short time later it's probably no longer

733
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,450
true so people who have thought that

734
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,520
maybe they're designing that

735
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:38,230
applications or protocols in the ITF who

736
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,730
think I have this bit of the network

737
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,960
that's safe over here and nobody's gonna

738
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,300
touch it because it's in there behind a

739
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,310
perimeter that doesn't seem to be true

740
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,910
nearly as much as you would think and

741
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:50,860
certainly that doesn't match reality we

742
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,830
have cases where we see competing

743
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,420
interests involved in so for example the

744
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:58,390
whole debate around applications doing

745
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,890
net DNS is a case in point about where

746
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,310
this you know different parties have

747
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:05,529
different interests and the fet model we

748
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,570
have doesn't consider that I'm not sure

749
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,130
what you can do about it and but even

750
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,170
more glaringly if you if you look back

751
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,060
at thing - it says the end systems we

752
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,530
assume are not compromised and what the

753
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,970
hell is a nan system these days when you

754
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,860
have virtualization you have

755
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,600
software-defined networking and a whole

756
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,090
bunch of other things that are really

757
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,650
not what we would considered as the kind

758
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,390
of host requirements which is I guess

759
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:28,240
that the mental model we might have had

760
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:30,618
like them so there's an argument that

761
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,439
thing two is no longer sufficient Ted

762
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:35,480
suggested that we could do a poetic

763
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,009
version of this and there's two poetic

764
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,910
versions one that this is one they're

765
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:42,259
really horrible this is the second one

766
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,578
also really horrible and the only reason

767
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:45,349
I put this up is you can guess who wrote

768
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:46,369
which if you really care first and the

769
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:48,650
picture in the back is kind of

770
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:51,470
reflective of where we think we are a

771
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,920
bit but prose might be better as an

772
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,160
ambush

773
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,509
and so what about this activity but I

774
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,890
guess all we're thinking about it'd be

775
00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:00,950
good to get people looking at this

776
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:03,680
problem and trying to consider are there

777
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:06,348
things that we can do that better

778
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,359
reflect reality but also that are useful

779
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:11,480
for people doing work in the ietf or

780
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:12,950
elsewhere in designing protocols that's

781
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,599
kind of like you know one of the nice

782
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,480
things about 3552 is the threat model is

783
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,579
nice and simple in other places in the

784
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,799
ITF for example there's an RFC for the

785
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,839
OAuth threat model it's a gigantic

786
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:25,819
complex thing so that's probably not

787
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,049
useful as generic guidance even though

788
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,630
it is a threat model that does include

789
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:31,190
the idea that parties involved in the

790
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,249
protocol may be colluding against one

791
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:37,940
another so we may end up with some kind

792
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:39,529
of statements like this the four of us

793
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,940
we all have to be on the IRB at the

794
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:43,549
minute but it is not an IRB thing

795
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,710
necessarily we're looking for guidance

796
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:47,980
and feedback we think there could be

797
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:51,739
some useful end results so for example

798
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,710
we have in RFC 69 73 some privacy

799
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:56,630
guidelines that are not really part of

800
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,039
the kind of ITF process formally but

801
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,130
that are useful talking about things

802
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:03,410
like data minimization maybe we can

803
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,730
think about the fact that some of our

804
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,649
protocols are some of our security

805
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,359
mechanisms and protocols may be

806
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,519
increasing tendencies towards

807
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,819
centralization in ways that we'd be

808
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:16,129
better off not doing we may have some

809
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:17,839
design process issues so for example in

810
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:20,299
the ITF somebody comes along and says I

811
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,410
have this use case I want to do and they

812
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:23,059
invent something that has a new

813
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,368
identifier that's a long term stable

814
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:26,930
identifier that gets everywhere and that

815
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:28,489
causes privacy problems maybe we should

816
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,410
be considering or encouraging people to

817
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:32,779
think of abuse cases so how can the

818
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,098
thing you want to do be abused and build

819
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:35,299
that into the design process and that

820
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:40,249
might be a simple a little bit bit of

821
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:42,349
guidance we could include so we're not

822
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:44,359
proposing right now to do a 3552 base

823
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:46,280
I'd have tried that didn't work

824
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,480
I think what we'd like to do is get a

825
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,700
bunch of people who are interested in

826
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,170
this to work together maybe I think

827
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,669
Taylor's gonna try and see if we can

828
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,080
stead of a mailing list if unless people

829
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,800
say this is all crazy and you shouldn't

830
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,060
do it and we could just kind of work the

831
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,640
problem with people who are interested

832
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,580
in us and perhaps after we've done that

833
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,190
to see if there's stuff that can be said

834
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,549
and then see can you window that down to

835
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,600
something useful that could apply to

836
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:14,210
places in the IETF or people putting

837
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,009
this kind of work perhaps after that we

838
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:18,440
might want to come back and look at some

839
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,020
kind of modification to the process and

840
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,400
BCPs that we have so we're not proposing

841
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,590
that the client dive right in there yet

842
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,790
without doing a better preparation work

843
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,170
and we're looking for feedback we're

844
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,920
looking for people who are interested in

845
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:32,150
being involved and if if people don't

846
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,440
tell us this is all stupid and crazy

847
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:39,860
you'll probably set up a mailing list

848
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:42,980
and send the cord that's to say hi Mohit

849
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:46,310
Erickson so this is not completely crazy

850
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:50,090
or stupid so I think you should continue

851
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:51,950
I get get that there is a need to

852
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:55,820
maintain the balance that if we open

853
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:59,390
open up saying that endpoints can be

854
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,580
compromised then we need to like think

855
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:04,069
how far they can be compromised and and

856
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,770
so on like we are not here to like

857
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:09,440
protect against someone you know do

858
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:12,200
physically threatening your things but

859
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,270
there are still still some things we can

860
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,009
definitely look at so for couple of

861
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:20,930
examples that that came to my mind miss

862
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,300
binding attacks are at least I I also

863
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:26,240
spoke to Acker about this is something

864
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,640
where one of the nodes participating in

865
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,520
the communication is compromised and

866
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:35,779
then he misleads you to talk to some

867
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,720
third party and if you have a server

868
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,580
database whether you are using a

869
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,730
symmetric fake or asymmetric or whatever

870
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:45,830
balance imbalance bake these kind of

871
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:48,530
things do make affect of what happens

872
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:53,930
when one of the nodes get compromised

873
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:55,640
and perhaps for us as protocol engineers

874
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,060
when we are designing these these things

875
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,190
we could

876
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,250
a better choice and prepare ourselves

877
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,590
for for the case when one of the the

878
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:06,870
parties is compromised then again like

879
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:09,570
we don't want to open the floodgates and

880
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,460
let everything end so definitely

881
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,320
interested and would like to see this go

882
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:17,250
forward need to be a little bit careful

883
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,110
I didn't see the order which people came

884
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,330
to the mic so let's just alternate I

885
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,120
demand a close an ski with myself

886
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:27,720
actually thank you for the presentation

887
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:31,160
this is extremely relevant as you know

888
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,049
sorry about missing the workshop I

889
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,920
didn't know it was going on I missed it

890
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:41,730
myself as you know I also have a draft

891
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,530
which is a new threat model smart ski

892
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:47,400
for this particular meeting which you've

893
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:49,230
commented on as well so I very much look

894
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,120
forward to working with you and in that

895
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,070
draft I do go through quite a lot of

896
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,040
threats that are happening in the most

897
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:58,680
recent years in particular with malware

898
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,630
botnets and data breaches so hopefully

899
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,640
we can fold that all in to have a more

900
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:06,330
broader perspective so I look forward to

901
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,940
working with you thanks thank you Dave

902
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:11,880
Taylor thank you I didn't know about the

903
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,620
workshop either until this ITF but I'm

904
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,690
interested in this topic we actually

905
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:19,049
have two working groups in this area

906
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:21,660
that are meant for cases where a thing

907
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:25,340
too is not true those two working groups

908
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:27,930
are rats and teeth and so the point is

909
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,810
yes I think it is good for us to have

910
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,279
some document as an area whether it

911
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,870
comes out of this effort or something

912
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,210
water that says how to think about this

913
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,950
in your threat modeling because we have

914
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:41,850
working groups so rats is trying to say

915
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:43,770
how do you do attestation where your

916
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,630
device may be compromised but your

917
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,710
device may have multiple different sub

918
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,600
modules in it whether it's different

919
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,550
layers in a secure boot chain or whether

920
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:53,009
it's different processor context one was

921
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,990
one is secure one is normal or whatever

922
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,460
depending on your architecture and so

923
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,169
rats has to do with that test station

924
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,390
and he has to do with remediation how do

925
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,740
you get out of that state and so since

926
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:04,259
we're actually doing work in this area I

927
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,299
think it's one that's good to make

928
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,160
visible across the area so as people do

929
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,840
their threat models and even as people

930
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,529
do say take a dependency on

931
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,870
authentication

932
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,100
mechanisms that where the threat model

933
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,810
is appropriate then they can take

934
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,910
advantage of say attestation that would

935
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:22,020
come out of say rats

936
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:24,990
sure yeah well and suit you but yeah but

937
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,150
the most relevant parts here are rats

938
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,220
for attestation for detection that

939
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:32,190
something is out of compliance and it's

940
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,689
in some secure way and then t4 during

941
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,250
remediation is how do you get back in

942
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,530
back out of that state if the device

943
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:40,260
actually supports that sure and there's

944
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,910
other ones to you right Kathleen yeah

945
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,860
all right and then I guess I know this

946
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:51,569
is looking at post compromised recovery

947
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:55,500
for key silicon I wanted to air my

948
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:58,920
surprise or well okay maybe I am

949
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:03,960
completely confused the surprise that

950
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:11,130
there is this thing to kind of seems to

951
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:15,020
be working twenty years ago did we think

952
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,020
about the end devices being vulnerable

953
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:28,620
phenomenon that after Snowden we focused

954
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:32,010
so much on the to miss transmission

955
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:36,270
paths that offered to certain attacker

956
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:41,670
environments a cheap way of of attack

957
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:44,830
and successful attack and we lost the

958
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:46,010
other parts of the world out of view

959
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:51,480
[Music]

960
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:54,510
well kind of surprising that this level

961
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:59,760
of discussion kind of such a thing could

962
00:48:54,510 --> 00:49:01,290
happen if it actually happened this is

963
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,720
jeffrey askin

964
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:06,330
i think it would have been very helpful

965
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,600
to my project if this already existed so

966
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:11,880
i plan to join your mailing list there's

967
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,950
one of the drafts talks primarily about

968
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,210
security while the other draft includes

969
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:20,160
both security and privacy i'm i don't

970
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,960
have a strong i don't know if it would

971
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,350
be better to combine them or separate

972
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,059
them

973
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:25,739
I suspect the W

974
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:27,719
we see has interesting things to say

975
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:30,269
about privacy so there should be some

976
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:31,680
ways on with them sure so when you refer

977
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:34,019
to the draft you meant the ones I have

978
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:40,348
here or there two that were listed on

979
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:41,910
this session Ali Rezai key Nokia thank

980
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:44,459
you very much for making this

981
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:47,098
presentation and I look forward to

982
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:51,680
working with you I think it will be very

983
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:55,949
important to get the definitions right

984
00:49:51,680 --> 00:50:00,328
define a scope and also look into use

985
00:49:55,949 --> 00:50:03,660
cases where it makes sense to be handled

986
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:06,420
by the IETF here thank you I look

987
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,979
forward to working with you if I could

988
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:14,219
process and interrupt and where are the

989
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:19,198
blue sheets you could bring them forward

990
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:23,880
so everyone can sign them back I'll have

991
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:26,699
a strong I think that would be good to

992
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:33,569
talk to people outside of the idea about

993
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:37,170
this in the w3c for instance we have had

994
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:40,679
a lot of work that assumes that the

995
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:46,400
secure thing is not the endpoint it's

996
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:51,479
the user agent and the secure thing is

997
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:55,679
executing the devil's cold so we assume

998
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:57,808
that the part that is controlling what

999
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:02,309
this we're supposed to be doing is the

1000
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:05,549
enemy on the other hand they do try to

1001
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:13,559
offer primitives so that it's possible

1002
00:51:05,549 --> 00:51:19,559
for one and one page to be reasonably

1003
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:21,660
sure that it's not itself compromised so

1004
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,660
that it can set up at rest environment

1005
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:27,269
and just relationship with a server for

1006
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,999
instance the one it's loaded wrong so

1007
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:33,448
that a question of who is the endpoint

1008
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:35,830
and who is it that we are assuming these

1009
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:38,540
are being secure

1010
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:43,279
jumps around a lot even within a single

1011
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:46,850
application so I think assumption 2 is

1012
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,420
really able but you have to shrink the

1013
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,620
definition of the endpoint down from

1014
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:55,820
everything that is beyond the network

1015
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:59,390
interface to think that is a bit smaller

1016
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:03,800
than that thank you all right Eric

1017
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:05,930
rajala yeah um like we were 30 52 we

1018
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,240
weren't like unaware without any viruses

1019
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:11,839
or malware or like she's got compromised

1020
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,490
I appreciate that people are fixating on

1021
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,100
this this point at the Internet throw at

1022
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:19,160
all um the the section at the endpoints

1023
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,600
being compromised I'm prepared to

1024
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,129
concede it may be in artfully written

1025
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,529
but the point there actually a still

1026
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,360
stands which is that when you want to

1027
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,250
build a concept protocol if you assume

1028
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,450
the other side is compromised at the end

1029
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,340
of the day you're not in a very good

1030
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,629
shape that doesn't mean that you're not

1031
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,630
doesn't mean you can't be talking to an

1032
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,310
attacker but it means that it's that

1033
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,500
it's very hard design security protocols

1034
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,820
that protects you in the face of the

1035
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,830
actual counterparty you're trying to

1036
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,780
talk to I've been compromised and worse

1037
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,640
and it's really true that the ideas

1038
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,650
about that have expanded over the years

1039
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,299
in terms of P FS and PCs and stuff like

1040
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,990
that but nevertheless that still is

1041
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:56,900
largely correct um so um I certainly it

1042
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:58,490
seems like interesting work and uh you

1043
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,470
know certainly I think we could try to

1044
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,640
UM you know Easter as we discussed a

1045
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,169
lunch expand some of the notions the

1046
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,390
endpoint or expand in some cases

1047
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,280
contracting others by just I do want to

1048
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,600
resist the idea to like somehow like we

1049
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,220
were so dumb but we didn't understand

1050
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,390
like machines to be compromised that's

1051
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,730
really not the case and there's like an

1052
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,839
entire section about DD about dose and D

1053
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,400
us in here so it's something about the

1054
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,420
case we didn't understand that you could

1055
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,310
have a compromised machines in the

1056
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:23,870
internet yeah this is not gonna solve

1057
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,370
all the universe's problems we might

1058
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:27,799
make some improvements but we're not

1059
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:30,319
gonna stop all bad things happening or

1060
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,650
something yeah Dave Walter Meyer so I

1061
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,940
mean Deckard's points this isn't

1062
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,640
something that we can solve with a

1063
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:39,710
single protocol either right we need a

1064
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,420
variety of different solutions that are

1065
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,700
targeted at different pieces of the

1066
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,380
problem now one of the one of the

1067
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,330
challenges that I've experienced as

1068
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,580
someone who's worked in some of the

1069
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:52,600
management the security management

1070
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:55,670
protocol space that exists in in in in

1071
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,770
ATF is we've heard a lot of comments

1072
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,510
that are like that that are basically

1073
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,610
around those kinds of protocols being

1074
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:04,040
sort of second-class citizens to a lot

1075
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:06,110
of the you know security protocols that

1076
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,540
exist and I think this is bringing out

1077
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:11,420
how important a lot of that you know

1078
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:13,880
security management work is to solving

1079
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,680
these broader problems and instead of

1080
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,940
actually shrinking the definition of an

1081
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,399
endpoint I think we should actually

1082
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,710
expand the definition of an endpoint to

1083
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,410
ensure that we are providing all of the

1084
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:28,750
management capabilities that can provide

1085
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:31,490
for a a more hardened you know internet

1086
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:34,220
infrastructures in the middle as well as

1087
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:35,660
on the ends near to some degree this is

1088
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:39,529
about getting away from the walled

1089
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:41,330
garden mentality of of looking at you

1090
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:43,190
know security

1091
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:48,190
you know our protocols have a fairly

1092
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:51,260
crunchy outside but we still rely on the

1093
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:53,150
squishy inside to be secure and we need

1094
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,490
to do more I think from an internet

1095
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,790
perspective to ensure that that squishy

1096
00:54:55,490 --> 00:55:05,899
inside is also protected because it's

1097
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:09,680
terribly easy to attack today hi Alma

1098
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:14,150
today Simo tech so I read the the drafts

1099
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:16,669
I was not aware of this our workshop

1100
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:18,770
Peter so I'm young here so I have no

1101
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:22,310
idea where they should go I think it

1102
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:26,180
should go somewhere just after all the

1103
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:28,690
story on TLS that that we've been

1104
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:31,790
through we got the feedback that people

1105
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:34,250
considered that security should only be

1106
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:37,100
done on the inputs of the communication

1107
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:39,260
so we said why don't we stop on that and

1108
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,690
try to understand what we are talking

1109
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:44,780
about sort of endpoints what is it about

1110
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:45,580
the setup model and we made an internet

1111
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,350
draft called

1112
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:50,900
capabilities and limitations of endpoint

1113
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:55,900
security solutions with the intention to

1114
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:58,460
simply codify and put words on on that

1115
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:01,790
that's called class by the way I have a

1116
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:03,450
sign meaning at 4:00 p.m. in color if

1117
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,058
people want to go there

1118
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,859
we got a lot of feedback and and and the

1119
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:09,809
thing is that we realized we got a

1120
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:12,960
number of lessons first of all I thought

1121
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:15,270
that this was not good value because

1122
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,280
since we are doing endpoint Security's

1123
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:19,380
in 30 years everything should have been

1124
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,160
written on the topic so first surprise

1125
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,990
one we had no taxonomies on endpoints

1126
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,270
second surprise the best we could find

1127
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:29,640
on the threat models was my tree attack

1128
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:32,040
and we're still asking ourselves is it

1129
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:35,279
the right model for us to describe what

1130
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:37,770
we need so we start with two big bad

1131
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,260
surprises and so then we started to do

1132
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:43,109
another in saying what would be an ideal

1133
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,940
security security endpoint of course it

1134
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:47,339
going to be very hard and then we

1135
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,290
started to list all the limits we

1136
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:52,440
started to figure out we put some

1137
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:55,650
production data to show what it is we

1138
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,319
find with real production data about how

1139
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:00,150
many attacks the endpoints cannot see

1140
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:03,750
and even network and sleep just to give

1141
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:05,250
us a real sense of the reality and we

1142
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,619
continued with asking ourselves like

1143
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:10,440
your good point about what is the impact

1144
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:13,230
of all of that by governance but is that

1145
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,630
the impose on the endpoint attacks or as

1146
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,730
regulations as well as what human rights

1147
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:19,650
are seeing there and finally the

1148
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:21,450
economic cost of all of that because

1149
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,579
someone will have to pay for that and

1150
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,859
I'm remaking something which is like we

1151
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:27,359
Frankenstein do you ever remodel by

1152
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:30,180
which to secure the endpoint you need a

1153
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,500
nitro computer on each side so we have

1154
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,348
to answer a number of questions here as

1155
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:37,309
well in your in your draft first if you

1156
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:39,750
make a good point on social attacks and

1157
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:41,400
so the question is this is not an attack

1158
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,829
on the device this is an attack on the

1159
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,930
brain so do you include the person in

1160
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:47,760
the endpoints or not because this will

1161
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,790
matter a lot there is an attack on the

1162
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,099
brain on the UX even before you are so

1163
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:55,290
anyway the summary is that we have done

1164
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:56,880
some work it's expanding we have a

1165
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,829
program for that we discussed this

1166
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,420
afternoon we think it makes sense I

1167
00:57:58,829 --> 00:58:03,569
don't know how you want to tie it I

1168
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:05,970
think I have more typhus Jerry's work

1169
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:08,099
because I it's more aligned with what

1170
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,470
I'm trying to do and maybe it's a full

1171
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:12,839
so we are happy to contribute happy to

1172
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:16,078
continue to work on that whatever stuff

1173
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:17,070
so please keep doing so just answer I

1174
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,390
guess it was a brother

1175
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,280
question languages help to contribute I

1176
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:21,900
guess it sounds like it's not crazy

1177
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:28,140
we'll make a mailing list and trying to

1178
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:30,990
listen I Stephen Elliott here first of

1179
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:35,490
all nice presentation and a couple

1180
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:38,790
points as a scientist statement I think

1181
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:40,529
maybe worth still reviewing 3552 to see

1182
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:43,200
if there's if it should be dusted off

1183
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:45,510
and and some stuff being looked at from

1184
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,460
Security's consideration standpoint I

1185
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:49,620
know you're growling the room but yes

1186
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,000
you know they're definitely time has

1187
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,819
moved on we probably should at least

1188
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,880
take a stare at it the second point I

1189
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:59,310
wanted to make was that in response to a

1190
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,080
Dave Taylor's I think actually his work

1191
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:04,770
and what you're proposing actually mesh

1192
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:07,049
really nicely together in that if you

1193
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:09,690
come out with something in with some

1194
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:12,030
reasonable alacrity I know that's a hard

1195
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:13,530
thing to do in this context but we could

1196
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:16,980
actually drive some of the work that

1197
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:18,870
that that's going on in rats and teeth

1198
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,580
in terms of saying well here's you know

1199
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,980
here's the mess we're in and here are

1200
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:27,569
some solutions that we can get to which

1201
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:29,480
leads to a question which is suppose we

1202
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:32,820
get to this Internet threat model and

1203
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,560
let's posit a world maybe in which heap

1204
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:37,020
and rats aren't quite there yet

1205
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:40,380
what sort of formalisms would you

1206
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:43,730
envision addressing a threat model that

1207
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:47,130
you would propose like would there be

1208
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:50,910
protocol approaches that you you could

1209
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:52,620
envision that would answer some of the

1210
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:54,180
threat models that that would address

1211
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:57,660
and how would how would you envision it

1212
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:01,589
apply to the IETF and mostly I don't

1213
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:02,850
know I mean I think some some there has

1214
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,890
been some suggestion and chats with

1215
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:09,029
other people that maybe there's there

1216
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:10,920
needs to be some kind of descriptions of

1217
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:12,710
different threat models that might apply

1218
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,090
in different kind of protocol contexts

1219
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:17,730
in terms of what kind of formalism if

1220
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,380
any like formal formalism would be use I

1221
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:20,850
don't know but there's a programming

1222
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,840
standpoint or from a description

1223
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:26,610
standpoint

1224
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:27,960
yeah I don't know if the answer your

1225
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,270
nuts could be si

1226
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,250
yeah like you just kind of lit it to you

1227
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:34,050
with different threat models for

1228
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:36,210
different applications I believe that's

1229
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:39,750
basically the point where we gotta get

1230
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:42,720
you because what you asked in your

1231
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:45,510
presentation is it worth to get to one

1232
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,609
consensus I believe it's not quiet

1233
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:50,370
because like I said it's incredibly

1234
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:53,930
difficult to design protocols when I

1235
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:56,759
can't trust the other party at all and

1236
01:00:53,930 --> 01:01:01,109
that's basically the case when the other

1237
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:04,980
party is arbitrarily modified by anyone

1238
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:07,740
that's not on my control so I believe it

1239
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:10,050
would be awesome to have such a thread

1240
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:13,410
model but I believe it's also worth

1241
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:16,680
considering to have like multiple steps

1242
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:18,930
in between that are pretty codified so

1243
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:22,169
that we have a decent way of talking

1244
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:24,690
what kind of threat model we're building

1245
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:27,450
against and where I have a common

1246
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:30,120
language on deciding what we're talking

1247
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:31,770
about without defining a given threat

1248
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:36,509
model for every single individual

1249
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:41,550
protocol and standard but still getting

1250
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:43,680
far towards multiple use cases yeah I

1251
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:45,210
think this would also mentioned that in

1252
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,859
a chat that there's been some academic

1253
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,970
work on threat models in various

1254
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,380
contexts that we might be able to

1255
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:54,720
leverage for definitions and things like

1256
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:57,120
that Ben Schwartz Google I think the

1257
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,640
title of your dress was does the

1258
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:02,580
internet need a new threat model

1259
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:04,500
something like that I I wonder if a

1260
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:08,240
better title would be does the internet

1261
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:11,730
have a new threat model in other words

1262
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:14,609
it seems to me that across the IETF over

1263
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:16,080
the past let's say five years there has

1264
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:18,210
been a revolution in the way that we

1265
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,029
think about security and we've seen a

1266
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:23,460
wide variety of security innovations

1267
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:24,810
that take a new perspective one one that

1268
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,910
is apparent to me a certificate

1269
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:29,070
transparency it's a very powerful

1270
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,720
approach that's very different from the

1271
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:35,750
way that I'm used I was used to thinking

1272
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:38,220
about security five or ten years ago so

1273
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,780
rather than thinking about this as an

1274
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:41,370
exercise in developing a new threat

1275
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,610
model I think it might be

1276
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:46,710
more conservative but possibly easier to

1277
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:48,540
think about it as collecting and

1278
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:51,330
summarizing the new threat models that

1279
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:52,740
as a community we are and in harmonizing

1280
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:54,960
the the new threat models that as a

1281
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:58,470
community we have developed and really

1282
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:02,040
advanced a lot that's fair points much

1283
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:05,250
of the routing area would agree but i'm

1284
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,680
lawrence lund blade i co as a co-author

1285
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,980
of the eat draft in the rats working

1286
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:12,810
group i haven't read your drafts just so

1287
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:15,120
i'm just going off but i've heard here

1288
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:18,990
but a lot of the discussions been around

1289
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:21,390
compromise and i think my i think of it

1290
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:23,839
differently as what you really want to

1291
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:26,490
know is who implemented this thing and

1292
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,220
did they do a good enough job so that it

1293
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:31,589
will not be compromised because you

1294
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,970
can't really detecting compromise and

1295
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:37,110
trying to do that that's kind of hard

1296
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:40,230
but if you can find out who implemented

1297
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:42,540
something you know dedicate the the

1298
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:46,110
implementer find out and think will

1299
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:47,730
nourish trusted that gives you a leg up

1300
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:50,130
like okay I'm going to trust talking to

1301
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:52,710
these guys but not those guys so i

1302
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:54,090
basically trying to suggest a different

1303
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:56,280
way of thinking a little bit way of

1304
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:58,640
thinking there and really what that is

1305
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,620
is kind of a definition of attestation I

1306
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,089
think lots people define attestation in

1307
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:06,270
a lot of different ways but I'm offering

1308
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:07,650
this as kind of a sort of one way to

1309
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:09,780
look at a station in the attestation

1310
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:13,890
that Dave mentioned when he was making

1311
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:16,890
his comments okay Marty so Mountain

1312
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:19,049
Thomson I've been enjoying watching the

1313
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,370
the three conversations or four

1314
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:23,160
conversations layered on top of each

1315
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:25,799
other here and I wasn't going to get up

1316
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,060
then you do cuz I'm on the IV and we've

1317
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,590
already had this conversation and you

1318
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,940
don't need that that input but I think

1319
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:32,070
it would be helpful for this

1320
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:33,060
conversation here to sort of make clear

1321
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:35,430
that there's a number of different

1322
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:38,580
conversations going on here there is the

1323
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:40,589
the aspect of the conversation that

1324
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:42,360
ecers talked about which is that it's

1325
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:47,220
very hard to design a concept protocol

1326
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:50,100
when you are operating out of the on the

1327
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:53,160
basis that the peers that you're talking

1328
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:55,049
to are compromised by attackers in in in

1329
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,740
the context of that concept

1330
01:04:55,050 --> 01:05:00,120
I think that's pretty well understood

1331
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,709
there have been some evolutions in the

1332
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,750
way that we understand how that how that

1333
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:07,010
operates such that we might want to put

1334
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:09,390
balance on the the extent to which we

1335
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:10,830
believe that to be true and and there

1336
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:15,600
I'm talking about things like the

1337
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:18,390
Pearson and whatnot but it seems to me

1338
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:21,240
that the discussion that the workshop

1339
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:25,049
and the drafts is is pointing out is

1340
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,509
something else which is that we're

1341
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,920
talking about alignment of incentives

1342
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,210
more than anything else

1343
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,450
previous speaker talked about

1344
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,530
attestations which is another thing

1345
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:35,850
entirely which I hadn't really

1346
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,660
considered that was probably more in the

1347
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:40,799
first bucket than the second one but

1348
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:43,080
when we're talking talking about these

1349
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,260
things Ben was clearly talking about I

1350
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:50,640
might be fine knowing that my connection

1351
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:52,140
is secure in the in the sense of TLS to

1352
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,250
give an endpoint but I don't know what

1353
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,830
they're doing without that information

1354
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,990
once they've got it and and maybe

1355
01:05:55,830 --> 01:06:01,500
they're maybe there aren't necessarily

1356
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:04,169
any alignment of incentives between what

1357
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:06,000
I want and what they want to do with

1358
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,530
that information and that's one of the

1359
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,730
major failings of the web as we have

1360
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:15,750
today so thinking about what you want to

1361
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:20,730
do with this work in either the first

1362
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:23,190
context or the second is probably what

1363
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:29,600
we need to do and being very crisp about

1364
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:32,400
that would be okay I think this is

1365
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:47,339
Steven that's nice that you wrote things

1366
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:49,860
up but what I don't see maybe you can

1367
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:52,290
shed some light as is where with the

1368
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:53,640
idea of contribute to this because for

1369
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:56,100
example Dave Taylor provided some

1370
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,839
examples on current activities that

1371
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:03,240
don't make this assumption that you

1372
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:06,540
previously cited and on the other hand

1373
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:08,330
it very much makes those assumption just

1374
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:10,670
for a smaller subset of

1375
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:12,770
in point like talking about the secure

1376
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:16,070
world being secure rather than the rest

1377
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:19,850
and the OS case is not too different and

1378
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:21,470
so the IDF is in a business of providing

1379
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:25,100
sort of protocols for interoperability

1380
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:26,750
where would the idea of contribute to do

1381
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,270
these type of things end point related

1382
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:33,050
security mechanism so it doesn't make so

1383
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:35,060
it doesn't lead to an a difference so I

1384
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:41,330
guess I'm confused I mean so I think

1385
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:43,640
this this work would G IDF work just

1386
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:47,630
writing things up is like write a book

1387
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:50,180
about it um yeah that would be cool nice

1388
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:52,040
pictures and everything yeah but that's

1389
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:54,649
not that's not really getting anywhere

1390
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:57,080
correct I mean I think so I think part

1391
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:58,370
of this would be figuring of what we

1392
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,020
thought of whole bunch of people think

1393
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:01,190
but in another part of it is trying to

1394
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:03,230
turn that into something that's actually

1395
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:05,930
useful for people doing protocol work in

1396
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:08,120
the ideas so it has to be and that's the

1397
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:10,879
part that I'm missing I don't see that

1398
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,770
those those aspects of way ice actually

1399
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,420
where's the info for me as a particle

1400
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:15,200
designer that would make a difference I

1401
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,569
don't I don't

1402
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:23,540
missile I I mean I guess we've had some

1403
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:25,750
cases taking not only thinking about use

1404
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:28,939
cases but abuse cases for example I

1405
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:31,850
think that is a defensible thing that

1406
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:34,040
you could say this is something that you

1407
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:37,010
could argue that should be part of a PCP

1408
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,870
in the IETF somewhere and it's a good

1409
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:40,580
exam but maybe more maybe it maybe just

1410
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:42,680
will fail I don't know Gary I guess does

1411
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:45,859
it ago yeah yeah so I just wanted to

1412
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,750
into tech slightly and say that yeah

1413
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:50,810
this is this is really hard what Stephen

1414
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:52,880
said is correct that we need to move

1415
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:55,190
forward and and have some advice that

1416
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,839
would actually be useful for for ITF but

1417
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:58,849
I do think that there are some things

1418
01:08:56,839 --> 01:09:01,700
that that you can take into account so

1419
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:05,120
I've certainly personally done that in

1420
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:06,819
in recent work you know adding BFS to my

1421
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,108
you know protocols that don't have that

1422
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:12,290
thinking about system architectures

1423
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:14,810
where I'm spreading some information for

1424
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:19,100
too many nodes when I could have you

1425
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:20,510
know kept it to need-to-know basis I you

1426
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,190
know looked at things where we were

1427
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:23,540
sending information to

1428
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:26,660
centralized parties in the internet

1429
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:28,310
where we perhaps wouldn't need to and so

1430
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,839
on so there are things that we can we

1431
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:31,430
can take into account at the IETF work

1432
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,809
also at least that's that's my

1433
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:35,029
experience that doesn't solve everything

1434
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:38,390
under the Sun but maybe a little bit

1435
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:40,699
helping and if I could add cuz I can't

1436
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:42,469
get one of us has to be up here so I'll

1437
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:44,238
take my privative I mean it's about

1438
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:46,790
residual risk it's not there that the

1439
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,290
ITF can address cut of all of those but

1440
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:50,180
the ability to kind of document those

1441
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,920
put them out there then when folks take

1442
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:53,930
IETF protocols and they compose them

1443
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,219
with other things that we've reminded

1444
01:09:53,930 --> 01:10:00,710
them that they need to consider this in

1445
01:09:55,219 --> 01:10:04,489
the integration process Daniel can't go

1446
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:07,130
more a cou so I'm happy that we're

1447
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:09,650
having this discussion I'm a little bit

1448
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:12,380
concerned about the idea of the ITF

1449
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:14,330
trying to figure out how to reach into

1450
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,739
the endpoints themselves and do a lot of

1451
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,809
stuff on the endpoints because I think

1452
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:19,250
we haven't been very good at doing that

1453
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:21,590
it doesn't mean that we maybe shouldn't

1454
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:23,410
try but I would I can imagine

1455
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:27,260
folks who work on the endpoints being

1456
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:29,540
territorial about that but one of the

1457
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:32,630
things that I think I don't think it's

1458
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:35,840
just about the network transmission

1459
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:38,000
stuff versus the endpoint have a lot of

1460
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,680
sympathy with ecker said about it's

1461
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,850
difficult to design a communications

1462
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,580
protocol where you assume the other

1463
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:45,260
party is malicious but the thing that I

1464
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:50,480
think is missing there is the sense of

1465
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:53,180
time perhaps about what happens outside

1466
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,500
and around the protocol so when I think

1467
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:59,300
about that I think of things like link

1468
01:10:54,500 --> 01:11:01,040
ability right where the where I may want

1469
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,840
to interact with the third with this

1470
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:07,219
external party but I want to make sure

1471
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:08,750
that that interaction is distinct from

1472
01:11:07,219 --> 01:11:11,230
other interactions that I've had with

1473
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:13,760
that same party and so there there is a

1474
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:15,290
there's a there's a gap there and I

1475
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,300
think thinking about it in terms of time

1476
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:21,040
maybe more than transmission versus

1477
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:24,080
endpoints might be a useful frame sure

1478
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:27,199
Brett Jordan I read your draft Stephen

1479
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,820
and I read on Dominique so I didn't read

1480
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,980
the other one so I apologize for that I

1481
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:33,559
wasn't also aware of any meeting that we

1482
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:34,879
were having about this so I do think

1483
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,199
this work is important it's very

1484
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,080
critical

1485
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:42,650
I do fully support it and even if that

1486
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:44,630
means at the end of the day that COMSEC

1487
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:47,299
protocols have a section in there on

1488
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:50,300
risk management for operational security

1489
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:52,940
to help illustrate what this means and

1490
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:54,650
help people you know put this into their

1491
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:56,509
risk profile when they're doing risk

1492
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:58,370
management in a large enterprise or a

1493
01:11:56,510 --> 01:12:00,739
large organization I think it's it's

1494
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:02,510
really important I do support it and

1495
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:04,730
thanks for doing the work you know for

1496
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:11,929
you and Dominique both graphs were great

1497
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:13,580
some things been Caidic so I came down

1498
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:16,550
here to the floor to share some thoughts

1499
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,780
as an individual and they've been

1500
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,040
changing over the course of living

1501
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,349
listening everybody else maybe I

1502
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,449
should've just stayed up there but to

1503
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:25,340
sort of maybe try it and then summarize

1504
01:12:23,449 --> 01:12:28,879
and synthesize from what we've been

1505
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:31,760
hearing it seems like is probably gonna

1506
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:34,640
be useful to recognize that there are

1507
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,410
more subtleties and gradations and to

1508
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,270
sort of broaden the horizons about what

1509
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:41,780
we're thinking about as we design

1510
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:43,670
protocols we may not need to try and

1511
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:46,130
reach into the end point with what we're

1512
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:47,989
doing but we could think about you maybe

1513
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:50,000
there's not just a single end point you

1514
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:52,370
maybe there's multiple different layers

1515
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,719
on the end point with things that have

1516
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:55,900
different layers and trusts that are

1517
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:59,480
implemented more robustly that you are

1518
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:04,460
potentially more susceptible to being

1519
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:06,379
controlled by an attacker and we might

1520
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:09,230
want to think about things in time you

1521
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:12,739
know what where the broader effects of

1522
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:18,530
what we're doing over time and and just

1523
01:13:12,739 --> 01:13:20,349
to sort of recognize that we have not

1524
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:24,019
just a binary black-and-white situation

1525
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:26,000
we might be talking to someone who we

1526
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:27,230
trust to correctly implement their

1527
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,600
software and to correctly in from the

1528
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:32,419
protocol but as Marie was saying to

1529
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,890
house a misaligned incentives so you

1530
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:36,739
know it's not like we're talking to a

1531
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:38,000
completely adversarial relationship and

1532
01:13:36,739 --> 01:13:40,669
so there's some things that we can do

1533
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,350
with them but you know we're not just

1534
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:44,230
gonna hand over all of our data to them

1535
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:47,230
blindly and we need to be able to work

1536
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:50,040
thoughtful about what we do and what we

1537
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:52,570
you know he was talking about that yeah

1538
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:55,000
I've been said of number of things that

1539
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:56,889
I wanted to say so thank you um I also

1540
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,750
on district Oh wiki tikis you just said

1541
01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:02,050
I think one thing 35 seats you just

1542
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:04,090
quite a bad job of he's sort of on

1543
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:10,120
privacy now it wasn't really sort of

1544
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:11,830
like being at the time but um no it

1545
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,809
doesn't do a good job at all recognizing

1546
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,519
the ways in which our protocol is great

1547
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:17,230
privacy risks and especially the way in

1548
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,570
which sort of large-scale use of these

1549
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:22,629
protocols crates um you know the

1550
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:24,940
addition of us of a you know a very

1551
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:26,650
small a large set of small individual

1552
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:28,089
privacy risks together a create a real

1553
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:29,530
problem so I think that would be

1554
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:33,010
something which really would benefit

1555
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:36,670
from some from something I'm not quite

1556
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:38,380
sure what that would be but if there you

1557
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:40,030
know I don't think we really had the

1558
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:42,489
notion at a time that sort of high

1559
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:44,769
dimension high dimensional likes you

1560
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:46,179
know sparse data sets were just such a

1561
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:48,430
big problems that turned out to be

1562
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:50,290
and so having something and as Arvind

1563
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,850
remind just basically yesterday so

1564
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:53,680
that's something which I think really

1565
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:56,650
would be nice to him I didn't catch so

1566
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:58,420
much in this in this presentation which

1567
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:59,739
isn't a criticism but just seems like

1568
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:05,080
another thing to put keep in the Opera

1569
01:14:59,739 --> 01:15:06,280
sure was I was hurt occur I say you

1570
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,300
already know I'd like this work if you

1571
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,239
had that conversation

1572
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:12,580
I really missed the days where I could

1573
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:15,759
open a socket to a port less than 1024

1574
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:19,269
and know it was going to be secure that

1575
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,540
was awesome come a long way since then

1576
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:25,600
and and been said exactly actually a lot

1577
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:27,670
of what I was gonna say and that the in

1578
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:31,000
society we have this notion of elevated

1579
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:32,680
trust and and as we negotiate and as we

1580
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,870
as we communicate with somebody

1581
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:36,580
our level of trusting them comes up I

1582
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:38,519
think there's a few AV documents gonna

1583
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,900
come up talking about that as well but

1584
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,000
we're missing that in the protocol space

1585
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:45,839
and and yet we users do this all the

1586
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,280
time right when you log into a website

1587
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,080
frequently you don't log in first I was

1588
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,639
just doing some United searches a second

1589
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,870
ago right they didn't ask me for my

1590
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,660
password and talked out to the point

1591
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:57,130
where it's time to commit I also

1592
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,469
remember back in the day is read go to

1593
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:00,070
HTTP sites and use them for a long time

1594
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:01,270
then

1595
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,219
it's like you had to submit your credit

1596
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:05,380
card and a lot of times they didn't even

1597
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:08,500
put the submit your credit card you know

1598
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:10,390
number in and until you you just said

1599
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:13,300
trust me the following link will go to a

1600
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:14,890
secure site but we have this notion and

1601
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,870
people have this notion of elevated

1602
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:18,760
trust all the time companies ask of us

1603
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:21,220
all the time now I need your two factor

1604
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:23,170
authentication before it didn't why we

1605
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,760
don't build that into sort of even more

1606
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:26,590
based protocols I don't know and why we

1607
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,390
don't assume that maybe both sides need

1608
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:29,530
some swim set of elevated trust because

1609
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:31,240
they're certain sites I certainly won't

1610
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:36,250
give a credit card to you even though I

1611
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:41,019
may go browse to them I think you're

1612
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:42,820
first oh thank you STP from and CSE so

1613
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:44,410
thank you for revisiting this topic I

1614
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:47,139
think it's very important topic

1615
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:48,580
generally and I've heard a lot of

1616
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,890
discussion in the my client's about

1617
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:52,480
endpoint security and considering

1618
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:54,280
different types of endpoints and

1619
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,049
classifying them and stuff and I would

1620
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,840
just like to highlight again the class

1621
01:16:56,050 --> 01:17:00,610
draft that is an individual submission

1622
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:03,250
at the moment which talks about the

1623
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:06,219
capabilities and limitations of endpoint

1624
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:07,990
security solutions so before we read you

1625
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:11,670
that work I'd just like to direct people

1626
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:15,910
to that and and I would also say that

1627
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:18,430
sorry I mean and I would also say that

1628
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:20,830
there's another draft that goes with

1629
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:23,170
that that's also got class in the name

1630
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:25,390
that talks about a taxonomy so that you

1631
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:26,920
can describe these endpoints different

1632
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:29,200
name different endpoints have different

1633
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:30,880
characteristics and so when you are

1634
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,639
connecting them you can expect different

1635
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,460
behavior and I just wanted to highlight

1636
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:38,200
that again before any work in that same

1637
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:45,850
space just gets redone under a different

1638
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:48,250
name Paul Turner in the definition of

1639
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:51,880
thing 1 and thing 2 and I understand it

1640
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:56,430
thing to now is in flux where would you

1641
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:58,750
place the IETF protocols or the

1642
01:17:56,430 --> 01:18:01,900
communication mechanism that they enable

1643
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:07,120
being used as an attack on the endpoint

1644
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:09,540
to compromise an employment so so you've

1645
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,860
got the endpoint assuming to be

1646
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:13,750
compromised but if the network is being

1647
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:17,559
used in the protocols Europe being used

1648
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:18,790
as part of that communication it you you

1649
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:24,010
considered that as part of the money

1650
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:26,560
well I I think probably mostly not

1651
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:28,060
unless there's some technical detail

1652
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,590
that's kind of interesting but you know

1653
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:31,000
I can send you an email that that's

1654
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:33,160
threatening that doesn't mean there's

1655
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,690
anything wrong with RCA 22 and its

1656
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:39,309
derivatives and so so III my initial

1657
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:41,739
reaction would be I can't think of a way

1658
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:43,960
in which we'd end up there but maybe it

1659
01:18:41,739 --> 01:18:47,320
may be but if you're looking at a threat

1660
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:49,300
model it's not about solving but at this

1661
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:52,330
point it's about considering that threat

1662
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:54,460
well we have this understanding for

1663
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:57,040
example as we encrypt connections if

1664
01:18:54,460 --> 01:19:00,010
somebody is able to use those as an

1665
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,140
attack mechanism to get to a compromise

1666
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:04,540
at the endpoint so just it's something

1667
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:05,620
to consider sure I mean I guess I would

1668
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,760
argue that just because something's

1669
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:09,699
encrypted just doesn't mean it's an

1670
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:13,530
attack so no tiger can send packets in

1671
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:15,879
care or encrypted or absolutely agree I

1672
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:18,580
mean clearly I mean if you know if 90f

1673
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,989
protocol enables a better DDoS

1674
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:21,400
reflection attack because of packet

1675
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:24,519
sizes or something that definitely is

1676
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:26,139
something we need to consider and I'm

1677
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,420
not sure as to whether the fact that we

1678
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:30,130
turn on encryption makes things bad is a

1679
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:31,960
possible thing that we should be

1680
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:36,280
contemplating here if that's what you

1681
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:38,410
meant but maybe it wasn't well no but if

1682
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:41,280
we're thinking about the point that the

1683
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:46,239
endpoint can be compromised and this

1684
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:49,360
body focuses on communications is it

1685
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:50,799
important to look at what contribution

1686
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,750
does the communication have to

1687
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,820
compromising at endpoint as part of that

1688
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:58,600
threat one so just it's again something

1689
01:19:54,820 --> 01:20:00,910
they to consider as part of what's been

1690
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:06,000
a pretty broad you know view which I

1691
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:09,340
appreciate sure Laura and slim blade

1692
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,580
thinking about maybe breaking thing to

1693
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:16,570
down into thing to a and thing to B or

1694
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:19,090
thing to a is the equipment software and

1695
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:22,449
implementation is to do something and

1696
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:24,130
thing to be is the service or the the

1697
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:25,989
entity that's actually operating stuff

1698
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:28,810
so

1699
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:31,389
I believe the attestation and what we're

1700
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:36,910
going after in rats and eat his thing to

1701
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:38,410
a it's the implementation but a lot of

1702
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:42,160
the discussion here around is is around

1703
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:43,360
privacy and trusting the service and

1704
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:47,920
with your credit card or your data

1705
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:50,080
that's thing to be so the equipment and

1706
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,060
the implementations could be great but

1707
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,250
the guy that's operating the service is

1708
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:56,080
selling it out the back room to somebody

1709
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:59,560
else or he forgets to do software

1710
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:01,570
updates or something like that so that's

1711
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:05,410
really more that almost seems like

1712
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:07,420
server auth or service off which is I

1713
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:09,849
consider quite different from

1714
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:12,430
attestation and I think we're gonna I'm

1715
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:14,170
hoping rats and eat stays away from the

1716
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:19,090
service part and just sticks to the

1717
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:20,890
implementation part okay kakoton I just

1718
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:22,360
want to try and attempt to and clarify

1719
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:25,270
about all the previous presenters Ming

1720
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,530
was trying to say I don't think

1721
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:29,469
necessarily it was work that should be

1722
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:32,530
done but probably the idea is that here

1723
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:35,350
we have we assume the end system

1724
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:37,480
engaging protocol is not being

1725
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:39,790
compromised I think there's like a third

1726
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:42,099
assumption which is that I am NOT an

1727
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:48,430
attacker the person sending the

1728
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:50,140
transmission so so I think so the

1729
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:52,060
consideration is an example you said

1730
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:53,260
like you know why would you think

1731
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:55,510
encryption is a bad thing I don't think

1732
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:57,430
anybody wants to say hey encryptions bad

1733
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,140
let's stop doing it but then it does has

1734
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:01,480
negative security impacts as well as

1735
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,980
positive I think yesterday they're

1736
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,500
mentioning for example researchers can't

1737
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:07,299
see why ot devices are doing because

1738
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,010
it's all encrypted so then it has

1739
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:12,130
privacy implications you have devices

1740
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:14,020
now sending your data out to who knows

1741
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:15,850
where and you don't know because

1742
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:18,130
everything's encrypted no that doesn't

1743
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:19,780
mean we should stop encrypting things

1744
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:20,890
doesn't mean maybe even we should think

1745
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:23,500
about this but I think that's the

1746
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:25,630
general concept and as you look like you

1747
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,820
were answering that point was that yeah

1748
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:30,010
I was trying to get in there because I

1749
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:32,139
feel increasingly uncomfortable in that

1750
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:35,140
discussion because it started off with

1751
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:37,810
to me like okay there challenges with

1752
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:39,449
endpoint security but I hear people

1753
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:41,340
saying oh that

1754
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:43,290
be the reason why we then

1755
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:46,679
man-in-the-middle our existing protocols

1756
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:49,469
to make things even worse but I I would

1757
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:53,429
like to offer an alternative on as you

1758
01:22:49,469 --> 01:22:54,960
know I work for arm and we also have our

1759
01:22:53,429 --> 01:22:57,840
friends from Intel in the room we

1760
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:00,179
constantly increase or add features to

1761
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,670
hardware providing extra security

1762
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:04,949
features and of course it's a it's a

1763
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:07,650
race against lots of the attackers who

1764
01:23:04,949 --> 01:23:10,710
are very very motivated commercially

1765
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:12,690
funded etc etc but we will definitely

1766
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:15,870
appreciate support from also from this

1767
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:17,940
community in making use of those

1768
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:19,679
hardware security mechanisms we have

1769
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:22,230
lots of open source projects and I can

1770
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:24,630
send pointers to the list on what we do

1771
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:26,730
and if some of you guys who care so much

1772
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:28,830
about security want to improve endpoint

1773
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:30,629
security help us to improve some of the

1774
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:32,519
operating systems the firmware on some

1775
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:34,260
of those other mechanisms rather than

1776
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:36,270
just writing one document after the

1777
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:38,280
other and say oh the work is so bad so

1778
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:41,880
let me suggest that we don't have the

1779
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:48,090
breaking TLS discussion in unless the

1780
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:51,420
80s want to do it all over again and so

1781
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:53,640
in general for me in this work we

1782
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:55,650
assumed thing one is still necessary and

1783
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:59,010
I think for me that closes off some of

1784
01:23:55,650 --> 01:24:01,019
those discussions at those funny non

1785
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:04,110
optimal crypto things some people might

1786
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:05,940
like to do so I'm Debbie Cooley from NSA

1787
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:07,739
I'm gonna take you out of the weeds and

1788
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:14,330
back up to the space where you belong

1789
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:18,080
here so determining what threat is is

1790
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:20,640
applicable to the system you're in

1791
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:25,140
depends on what you have purview over

1792
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:27,570
right so you have access to this space

1793
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,280
and you need to consider the threats

1794
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:32,429
that are applicable against that space

1795
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:34,440
you're begun to reach into the endpoints

1796
01:24:32,429 --> 01:24:36,840
in the IETF where you perhaps haven't in

1797
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:39,330
the past and so the endpoint now comes

1798
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,670
into the into the purview where it may

1799
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:44,100
not have been in the purview before so

1800
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:46,710
you it needs to be a holistic look at

1801
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:49,140
threat to base on what the system is the

1802
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:52,890
attacker is always going to be one up on

1803
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:53,320
you always right because you have to

1804
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:56,020
protect

1805
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:59,139
everything and he just has to attack the

1806
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:03,070
thing that's the easiest and he wins

1807
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:05,320
right at that point so you have to

1808
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:07,719
spread your resources out amongst the

1809
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:14,200
whole thing and he gets to pick the one

1810
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:15,520
thing that you've missed right so the

1811
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,490
first thing you need to decide is

1812
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:21,520
exactly what your space is what part

1813
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:25,000
does the ITF have the most ability to

1814
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,470
affect and then you design your threat

1815
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,500
documents your threat statement of

1816
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:31,480
threat to meet that if you want to delve

1817
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:34,030
into the endpoint security case which

1818
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:35,950
you have already started to do then that

1819
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:39,340
comes into it and then thing two becomes

1820
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:41,050
part of the game yeah mostly I guess

1821
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,430
where I would phrase it differently is I

1822
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:44,710
don't think the ITF has reached in there

1823
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:47,650
the definition of endpoints has changed

1824
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:49,210
over the last decade or so in ways that

1825
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:52,450
have some impact on our threat matter so

1826
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:55,180
so we need the endpoints to be good

1827
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:58,660
right so the thing to statement needs to

1828
01:25:55,180 --> 01:26:04,360
be true in that we need the endpoints to

1829
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:08,470
be not compromised I'm not sure I agree

1830
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:11,019
in general no no positive statement

1831
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:14,380
right so I need I need my endpoint to be

1832
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:17,020
a good thing I need not to have an

1833
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:19,300
attacker inside of it so so one of the

1834
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:20,650
things in discussing this we we've been

1835
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:23,830
talking about but haven't come to

1836
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:27,009
something some definition of is maybe if

1837
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:29,230
you think about this as a protocol

1838
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:31,450
between multiple parties if they're all

1839
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:33,070
compromised probably it's game over but

1840
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:34,150
if one of them still isn't maybe there's

1841
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:36,759
something we can do better than we're

1842
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:38,799
doing there so that if that party has

1843
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:41,590
access to everything then I would still

1844
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,240
say game over it depends we may be able

1845
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:52,750
to do better than nothing as far as I

1846
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:54,460
guess but I do think you need to look at

1847
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:56,470
things holistically it's just a

1848
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:58,150
one-size-fits-all game right so it just

1849
01:26:56,470 --> 01:27:00,100
depends on what the protocol is and what

1850
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:02,170
it affects based on its gonna determine

1851
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:03,430
what you need to care about and it's

1852
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,780
really unclear whether we can come up

1853
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:06,190
with something generic enough and then

1854
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,880
reduce it to something simple enough

1855
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:08,650
actually

1856
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,719
useable does those are all unclear

1857
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:12,429
things yeah all right to be clear we're

1858
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:16,360
cutting lines at the folks that are in

1859
01:27:12,429 --> 01:27:20,290
the queue right now okay so today your

1860
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:21,610
game so from Symantec so I think it's

1861
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:24,250
very clear that if you have a prime of

1862
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:26,049
just naming stuff so somebody said what

1863
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,909
is the common language to discuss what

1864
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:29,770
is an endpoints actually it's even worse

1865
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:32,559
we don't have a long way to describe an

1866
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:34,780
attack surface internal attack surface

1867
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,790
external attacks from other forces we

1868
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:39,340
don't have a model to describe the

1869
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:41,469
attacks and then back to the gentleman

1870
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:44,080
from arm I think that very good points

1871
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:46,090
they are doing stuff on the yard where

1872
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,620
people are doing stuff India Brazilian

1873
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:48,909
people are doing some in the application

1874
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:50,769
and on top of that there are other

1875
01:27:48,909 --> 01:27:53,409
things you need a suit party on top of

1876
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:55,719
that so we don't have a mother to only

1877
01:27:53,409 --> 01:27:58,089
sticky look at the security for all of

1878
01:27:55,719 --> 01:27:59,409
these pieces together so I understand

1879
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:02,170
the debate what does it mean for

1880
01:27:59,409 --> 01:28:03,790
protocol designers I'm too young here to

1881
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:06,130
discuss that the only thing I can offer

1882
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:08,710
so the work we're doing with mark over

1883
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:10,270
there is try to put words on things so

1884
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:11,980
that at least we start from the same

1885
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:14,739
baseline and I promise you it's already

1886
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:16,388
very hard so if you are interested

1887
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:18,669
please help but at the same time please

1888
01:28:16,389 --> 01:28:21,610
you and Jerry give us input what you

1889
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:22,929
need from us I don't know maybe we have

1890
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:28,509
a way to find a good collaboration

1891
01:28:22,929 --> 01:28:31,750
mother Thank You Kathleen we already so

1892
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:34,420
I do think we need to go into two and

1893
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:37,570
that we have been already I think where

1894
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:40,060
I differ from Deb's comment is that I

1895
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:42,699
mean ideally we'd keep everything secure

1896
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:46,150
nobody would ever get in but work like

1897
01:28:42,699 --> 01:28:47,980
sack and then rats helps us to detect if

1898
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:50,320
something has been compromised so if

1899
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:52,839
there's some sort of change and your

1900
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:55,090
posture assessment or system hygiene

1901
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:58,420
whatever phrase you want to use in the

1902
01:28:55,090 --> 01:29:01,750
sacrum sense and that can be signaled

1903
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:04,090
you can detect and then thwart an attack

1904
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:06,550
before either privilege escalation

1905
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:10,750
happens or lateral movement within a

1906
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:13,449
network happens and so you know the

1907
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,960
detection piece is something we should

1908
01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:15,669
consider

1909
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,520
right so you may not keep your system

1910
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:20,230
completely secure but being able to

1911
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,590
detect that attacker and thwart them as

1912
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:23,580
quickly

1913
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:26,230
as possible you can look at like

1914
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:30,070
Lockheed Martin kill chain or a mitre

1915
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:34,360
attack and it does benefit you to catch

1916
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:36,040
them early and and that work has has

1917
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:38,559
made a lot of progress in recent years

1918
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:41,080
because the time to detect the tax has

1919
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,030
gone way down and it's it's really you

1920
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:44,889
know detecting change so if we could put

1921
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:47,980
more energy into things like stack them

1922
01:29:44,889 --> 01:29:50,320
and make it really work and rats I think

1923
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:52,869
those would be big gains and would help

1924
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,460
against you know if this is in our

1925
01:29:52,869 --> 01:29:57,848
threat model then then we can show that

1926
01:29:54,460 --> 01:30:01,000
we're doing real things to aid in in

1927
01:29:57,849 --> 01:30:04,000
that objective so just following the

1928
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:08,230
previous comment about ITF workspace so

1929
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,960
historically ITF has been the space that

1930
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:13,209
we've been focusing on identifies and

1931
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:16,869
proof of possession so all the way from

1932
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:17,590
ISO Camp Eggers Iran then Hawkins doing

1933
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:21,219
iv1

1934
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:23,560
right IPSec everything's but I the only

1935
01:30:21,219 --> 01:30:26,230
way I can prove Who I am is possession

1936
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:30,730
of privacy I think we should extend that

1937
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:32,650
to proving my state so if I'm talking to

1938
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:35,259
you this up besides showing you showing

1939
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:37,929
me your proof of possession show me also

1940
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:40,270
proof of State and and this is what the

1941
01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:43,170
rats people are doing this is what the

1942
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:46,080
PCG people have been doing since 1999

1943
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:49,420
again it's a it's a it's a consortium

1944
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:52,869
but but I think the threat model should

1945
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:56,139
address the information modeled rats is

1946
01:30:52,869 --> 01:30:59,230
doing oh the other way Iraq maybe the

1947
01:30:56,139 --> 01:31:03,849
rats information model needs to inform

1948
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:05,739
the the threats document its yeah person

1949
01:31:03,849 --> 01:31:07,119
for me it's not clear how broadly

1950
01:31:05,739 --> 01:31:09,968
applicable some of these things are but

1951
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:11,920
