00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,889
[Music]

3
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,820
one eating

4
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,030
jabbers dry strikes

5
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:54,680
okay good evening welcome to the core

6
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:58,330
meeting so I'm Kirsten Gorman and this

7
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:02,570
is not a very - because we have a

8
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:09,100
standing chair this time Francesca what

9
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:14,049
a Muni no Francesca Bellamy and the name

10
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,049
isn't defined yet but might be Julia

11
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,320
[Laughter]

12
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:29,029
okay so this is an ITF meeting note well

13
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:39,530
and all agenda bashing we have only one

14
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:42,320
hour today so we took short items and we

15
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,239
have two hours on Thursday and this is

16
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:52,030
where we will do the complicated stuff

17
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:55,420
so today this is the call applications

18
00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:00,980
resource directory pops up binding and

19
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:07,010
the Cochran cluster the the yank cluster

20
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:11,540
and Thursday is Oscar related work and

21
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:15,079
multi class related work and maybe an

22
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,940
update of the group comb document a bit

23
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,000
of cinema

24
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,530
revisit of the

25
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,980
phaser congestion control proposal and

26
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:31,119
then we even might have some time if we

27
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,240
don't spend it early any comments on the

28
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,100
agenda oh sorry this is not the final

29
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,380
agenda here I wasn't able to upload

30
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,230
slide so Fraser is moving a little bit

31
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:45,010
to the beginning because there is

32
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:49,810
something happening in TS v WG that it

33
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:55,599
was to go to good anything else we need

34
00:04:49,810 --> 00:05:01,750
to change in the agenda okay this slide

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:06,640
is not complete we had two hours nearly

36
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:10,560
two hours of side meeting already in

37
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:16,240
this lot preceding this lot so we

38
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:21,870
discussed mostly core applications and a

39
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:28,500
little bit of hyper media so some of the

40
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:31,840
changes are in the slides already and

41
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,510
tomorrow morning there will be a side

42
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,150
meeting of the things you think research

43
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:42,909
group and I'm sure we can find out when

44
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:45,060
that starts I think H 30 and yeah what

45
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,530
what else should I be pointing to

46
00:05:45,060 --> 00:06:00,750
anything else that's interesting for

47
00:05:47,530 --> 00:06:04,869
this group that's this one okay so

48
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:09,310
working group document status we

49
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:12,760
actually published our of cat6 13 a

50
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,010
couple of weeks ago so you can all

51
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:19,900
congratulate Francesca

52
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:22,969
[Applause]

53
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:28,280
this may have been the hardest document

54
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:32,360
to finish in this group we have other

55
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,599
documents in isg processing right now

56
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,890
that there is one with a discuss that we

57
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,220
hope to clear this a week and two we

58
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:48,610
just submitted to the is G so these are

59
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:52,210
going through ad review and we might

60
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:56,240
either get them back get them forwarded

61
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:59,060
next week or so and we have three

62
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,600
documents that are in last call

63
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,660
processing stateless I think we still

64
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,600
need a revised ID is that am I correct

65
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,870
in that I can request tagged we need a

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,380
revised ID after the working class car

67
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,960
and compliment we have a revised ID but

68
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,880
I haven't heard anything from the people

69
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,150
who had comments so I think before we

70
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,950
push the button on that would be good to

71
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:42,859
have some some feedback from the people

72
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:47,150
who had comments and I can hear you that

73
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:50,840
the the speakers put in in a way that

74
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:58,130
they are NT faced speak about any of

75
00:07:50,840 --> 00:08:00,020
these documents okay so I I started my

76
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,120
review I finished the edge I just need

77
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:07,190
to write it down basically two comments

78
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:09,400
on it is if there are two minor problems

79
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,750
in the media type registration template

80
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:17,239
one is the encoding field actually is

81
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:20,360
supposed to be a selection of one for

82
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,000
choices in my instead so let's talk

83
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,320
about other encodings but not it doesn't

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,979
have to talk about in the same level

85
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,300
details

86
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:30,190
the other thing missing is the ending of

87
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,990
fragment identifier

88
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:37,299
as per plus Jason all plus he wore

89
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:47,380
suffixes I think other than them you

90
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:49,420
know they're fairly simple so yeah what

91
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,710
what we learned from this is that those

92
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,569
documents that do media type

93
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,580
registrations probably need a special

94
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,840
review within the working of to make

95
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,020
sure they are really good when they

96
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:05,080
leave the group I think we know how to

97
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:07,540
do that but apparently requests and I

98
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:16,810
save the message through to them anyway

99
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:17,469
so the directory the document takes a

100
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,589
bit more effort

101
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:29,680
all right down my comments I think it's

102
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:32,500
mostly fine my general comment is that

103
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:39,459
some bits are slightly under specified

104
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:42,670
like secure discovery things and it's

105
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:47,440
not always clear where the references

106
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:49,689
are through the informative but that you

107
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,460
know maybe cannot be there the whole the

108
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,010
informative reference should stays

109
00:09:51,460 --> 00:10:00,240
informative but there might be a couple

110
00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,240
of cases where I will question that

111
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:20,160
thing that's probably at this point yeah

112
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:23,100
in any case this slide is kind of we

113
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,329
finally are moving through this move it

114
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:32,280
seems to to work so given that we are

115
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:36,830
shipping documents we actually now are

116
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:39,089
making adoption calls and well this one

117
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,630
here had a little accident

118
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:46,110
we had expired just when I was going to

119
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:51,200
do a working last call and so it will be

120
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:55,650
resubmitted and then we will do that and

121
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,180
these are adoption calls so we had an

122
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:02,430
option call on the two main Kuril

123
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:07,170
documents we had pretty good response on

124
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:13,280
that all positive it ends today so you

125
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:17,849
can still throw in your opinion we had a

126
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:21,000
call on the yang library and actually

127
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,470
nobody responded to that except for any

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,160
payment who said this is the wrong

129
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:30,540
approach so later in the Cochran segment

130
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,850
we will have to discuss that and we made

131
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,939
a an adoption call of Corrections and

132
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:39,120
clarifications about 37 years ago and

133
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,360
for some reason haven't closed that yet

134
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,360
so I have to talk to my co-chair when

135
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,610
you specter to find out where we are

136
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,730
with that but if you still have an

137
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,040
opinion on this since it's still in

138
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,510
limbo you can still answer the GUP

139
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,250
adoption call if you still find it on

140
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:01,680
the mailing list okay that's about

141
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:05,610
document said is any other questions

142
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,290
about document status firstly there are

143
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,180
a number of documents we are working on

144
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm not listing them um

145
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:37,469
so let's talk about Genesis tier okay

146
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,310
I'm Peter filmstock I'm going to tell

147
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,140
you about our DD in SSD the importance

148
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,449
of the document has recently in being

149
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,610
increased a little bit because within

150
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,810
the resource directory document there

151
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,810
was some reference how you could

152
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:55,500
discover the resource directory you've

153
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,180
had discussions about it groups that we

154
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,520
have to have more experience with the

155
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,920
resource directory to see how it can be

156
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,920
discovered but one of the subjects there

157
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,010
was how to discover it with DNS and the

158
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:13,770
promise was to put that in the Rd dns SD

159
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:17,160
draft the r DD an SSD draft that has

160
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:20,790
some editions first of all where the Rd

161
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,069
surface is exported to DNS that you can

162
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,079
find it from the DNS and certainly we

163
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:30,990
have some examples where especially we

164
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:34,170
put the st as called attribute s3

165
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,510
attribute on a parameter in to see how

166
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:43,979
it is used which defines the surface of

167
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:47,280
the of the resource within the DNS so so

168
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,520
the new parameter is st it maps directly

169
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,850
to the surface part in the dns SD

170
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,640
surface instance and it is pre specified

171
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,980
so before in the door after rd d + SSD

172
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,350
there was no automatic transformation

173
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,130
from the resource type which is defined

174
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,500
within the core to the surface type

175
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,050
which was there to DNS this has proved

176
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,800
to be very unhappy and unlucky because

177
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:18,569
of use of a character sets which were

178
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,020
not completely equivalent so in Dowsett

179
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,400
you have to define the SD attribute and

180
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,980
register that in the end appropriate

181
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,500
transport protocol port

182
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,829
registry so that makes clarifies things

183
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,660
a bit a lot I must say and then come so

184
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,599
it have conforms to the syntax which is

185
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,230
defined so I will try to get this to the

186
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,720
example if you can't actually define

187
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,589
anything just goes to the examples so

188
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,589
what we have is we have the Rd lookup

189
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:50,690
rest you can ask for all the resources

190
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,600
which actually should be exported which

191
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:57,139
is pensions because the exp attribute is

192
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,540
set in the link so the request is here

193
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:02,690
does fortunately only one return which

194
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,699
says that XP which is there so it means

195
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,949
it is one saying one of the resource

196
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:09,949
which has what's needs to be exported to

197
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:12,349
DNS and it tells you the st which in

198
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:15,829
this case is oh i see the light and it

199
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:18,350
should have been actually specified

200
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:20,269
before and we have done the RT the

201
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,220
resource type which is actually used by

202
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,980
the resource directory for filtering if

203
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,350
you like which there is also specified

204
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,600
in the link and it tells you what is the

205
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,130
instance name because within DNS you

206
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,250
have the surface and you have the

207
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,680
instance and domain so instance surface

208
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,319
domain specifies actually what you want

209
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,969
to settle find out in the dns and there

210
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,459
are some other attributes which are

211
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:47,360
resource directly this specific which is

212
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:49,939
the sector and the end point so what the

213
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,529
idea is that once that is defined in the

214
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,839
resource directory like it is here that

215
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:57,130
you have an agents which goes through

216
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,339
this data and then you're following the

217
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:03,319
creates the DNS the resource records and

218
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,449
none of the ports would still have to be

219
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,149
clarified more in the draft is how you

220
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:10,969
find the DNS zone name which actually

221
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,769
corresponds with all the which devices

222
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,680
which you find this which are registered

223
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:17,300
in the resource directory so in this

224
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,339
case what you see there is a surface

225
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,740
defined and there is a pointer record

226
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:23,740
which points to all the possible

227
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,319
instances which you find for this

228
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,569
possible surface so here there's only

229
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,670
one instance but you can easily imagine

230
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,899
that you can have hundreds of instances

231
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,000
which will make the search and be

232
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:38,540
difficult so one has to be very careful

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,150
about XV sated Lea specifying both

234
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,370
of service you want and what are the

235
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,030
different instances of that all sink

236
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,520
remains manageable then got it says that

237
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,949
the spot osg IFD light which is this

238
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,660
instance of this surface has in-text

239
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,220
record and in that you can puts the

240
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,350
different attributes which are not

241
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,520
really known to DNS but you want to

242
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:04,880
actually inform to the PU people using

243
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,980
the the devices using the the resource

244
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,200
which had then put in the text records

245
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,800
so in this case you will see that there

246
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,050
is this sector is defined here and the

247
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,060
resource type has been defined which are

248
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,940
not known to DNS but you can put in a

249
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,460
txt record and then finally then we come

250
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,100
to the part which is important we see

251
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:29,710
that this instance mr. servers switches

252
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,709
on the service name which is fine

253
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,399
example comb which can then be fine with

254
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,610
the host name and the host name where

255
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,620
you find it that it has that the IP

256
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:44,740
address written finally can be found any

257
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,739
comments on that

258
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,299
[Music]

259
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:08,210
does it make sense to set you can do it

260
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:10,250
but there is no no meaning then you have

261
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,410
a problem because the server will not be

262
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:16,910
able to actually determine what the

263
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:22,730
service you think it's a double yeah

264
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:26,870
yeah yeah okay good

265
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:33,610
trying to remark yes what the privacy

266
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:36,020
implications of this so for an account

267
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,429
what are the privacy implications how

268
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,250
his authorization does information

269
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,400
control can you also state your name

270
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,400
please

271
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,960
so good remark actually this is also

272
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,700
true for the resource directory you want

273
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,040
to know if you put sinks into a source

274
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,780
directory how can this be authorized

275
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,730
I want to point you to the authorization

276
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,980
server which has been developed on by

277
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,750
ace and there are some hints both in the

278
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,910
resource directory and also in the Rd

279
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,890
draft how this should be done but how

280
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:09,070
you want to actually do is specify the

281
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:09,070
single subject of another raft yeah

282
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:20,360
other remarks yeah okay if you saying

283
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:25,010
this is interesting I all recommend that

284
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,290
you read the DNS is the draft so then

285
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,629
one of the things is that actually you

286
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,120
want to export the resource directory

287
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,490
also to the DNS which makes it possible

288
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,139
that from from DNS you can find the

289
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,570
resource directories in the domain that

290
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,210
interests you and that is slightly

291
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:44,450
different because in this case you have

292
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:47,120
to do and have then you know the

293
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:50,060
resource directory address you can get

294
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,899
and get and ask well-known core what is

295
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:56,000
the XP which is there which is there

296
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,280
present and in this case we have two

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,680
types of resources which is the Artie

298
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,080
bucco press and I do look up PP which

299
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,450
both serve to do the resource lookup and

300
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,669
the endpoint will look up and it tells

301
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,580
you also but you know it's the standard

302
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,200
vector with the service type is etc one

303
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,210
of the things it is different because

304
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,330
there the resource record gives you the

305
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:19,010
complete the complete you arrive that

306
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,490
you want to look here you only got the

307
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,960
resource mentioned so the agent is to be

308
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:29,270
slightly different it has to get the the

309
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,730
domain and the name and the and the

310
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,670
scheme from this phone actually already

311
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,990
well-known from the phone from the

312
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,430
resource directory itself

313
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,210
and not from the contents of the

314
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:43,310
resource directory so I think that is

315
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,710
about oh yeah any of to answer your

316
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,909
question the instance here has been

317
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:52,340
determined vary by the by the author

318
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:56,000
authorization server so whenever ask may

319
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,860
I actually can I be pull output to a DNS

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,960
then what's the authorization

321
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:04,219
certification identifier and that has we

322
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,220
put them yeah I think that's it oh yeah

323
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,799
one of the things which

324
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:11,250
not clear yet or we still need some

325
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:14,220
discussion is how you actually specify

326
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,520
the coop which is the transport that you

327
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,230
use or coop s which may be different and

328
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,570
as you have seen in the other example we

329
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,220
have put it in the surface type in the

330
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:26,299
service type such that you can use it

331
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:30,390
there we use the dots up there to

332
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:32,520
distinguish as we have to see how things

333
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:36,870
will be used if this adopts up can be

334
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,530
removed later on yeah you want to react

335
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:46,559
to that

336
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:48,649
Stewart no okay so here's the same thing

337
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,870
but then for the two ones worked out

338
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:58,799
also for the for the food resource

339
00:21:51,870 --> 00:22:02,668
directory I think yes this is the new I

340
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,830
am NOT down so if we still have to do

341
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:06,659
how to derive the domain part from the

342
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,510
inner surface within the phone there are

343
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,789
some drafts which already gives hints

344
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,740
and how you could do it but you think it

345
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,679
may be good to spell it completely out

346
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,500
here and so how to handle the transport

347
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,570
Cobra coop s that needs to be added to

348
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,720
the servers in the DNS so for the moment

349
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:30,270
we have a solution but I can understand

350
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:32,840
that or some discussion yep you want to

351
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,840
say something

352
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:47,550
and I'm still treasure from Apple I can

353
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:51,159
give you my advice on the two questions

354
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,780
what we did in the discovery proxy code

355
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,680
we've been working on which is on the

356
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:59,379
ITF hackathon github page and open is

357
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,110
the default configuration if you just

358
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,870
installed the open wrt package is home

359
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,580
dot Harper okay which is something you

360
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,979
can use within your home it's not global

361
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,290
you need don't expect it to work between

362
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,820
networks but it gives you an

363
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,870
out-of-the-box default that does

364
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,929
something reasonable

365
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:20,110
you can then overwrite that manually if

366
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:22,030
you want a domain with global

367
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:26,889
significance and I think the same thing

368
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:29,080
would work here on the second point if

369
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm understanding what you wrote there

370
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,370
correctly you're talking about in the

371
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,000
SRB rack or in transport protocol label

372
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:42,669
which is typically either TCP or UDP in

373
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,790
this case it should be beaten so my

374
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:48,760
advice there is I think if we could go

375
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,290
back and do it again we wouldn't do it

376
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,860
that way I think that was a mistake and

377
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:56,440
the definition of SRV mm-hm

378
00:23:52,860 --> 00:24:00,070
the the service name doesn't have to

379
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,290
encode the implementation details and it

380
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,689
doesn't have to say doc TLS if it uses

381
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,659
TLS it doesn't have to save dot utf-8 if

382
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,460
it uses utf-8 X doesn't have to say doc

383
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,340
I currently if it uses floating point

384
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,400
numbers the service name is not in a

385
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,620
description of the protocol it is just a

386
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,990
unique ID yes if you look up in the

387
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,389
table if I could go back and do it again

388
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,270
I would get rid of the TCP UDP and I'll

389
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,340
just call it underscore SRB yup fans and

390
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,050
then you read the RFC to find out what

391
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,810
the detail is now and will stand up

392
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,909
given given where we are that

393
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,830
established convention is that anything

394
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,640
that runs at the TCP uses others core

395
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,939
TCP and anything else said on the school

396
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,950
UDP yes even it's actually not using UDP

397
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,400
it doesn't matter that just means other

398
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,789
and it's just boilerplate text and don't

399
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,789
think it has any particular

400
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:55,789
okay fine okay thanks very much

401
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:04,740
that a teetotum end of this year is in

402
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:07,830
reasonable timeline I think maybe

403
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:15,510
earlier depends on the discussions we

404
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:19,070
have ongoing etc yes the Singapore seems

405
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,070
to be a lovely time for lots of things

406
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:47,909
right so what do I do you click here

407
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:51,539
okay so pub/sub we recently just really

408
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:53,909
recently on on a pre-meeting around the

409
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,890
deadline time and then over the last few

410
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:58,110
days done a lot of work on pub/sub i

411
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,200
have a lot of slides i'm gonna try to

412
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:03,689
get through them in 15 minutes so if you

413
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,380
unless it's super burning kind of hold

414
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,370
off till the end so what we're doing is

415
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,520
addressing the remaining issues around

416
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:13,770
topic handling and we tried to define

417
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,929
you know new response codes and a bunch

418
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,299
of different things and we kind of have

419
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,510
a new design around topic handling that

420
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,860
avoids a lot of those issues

421
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,809
specifically how to handle empty topics

422
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,299
how to publish link format documents

423
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,490
that had name conflict how to simplify

424
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,049
and clarify life time and and while

425
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,960
doing that keeping it compatible with

426
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:36,059
rest api's so what we're proposing is to

427
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,049
create a topic configuration resource

428
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:41,580
that's separate from the topic data so

429
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,190
we'll use create and delete on the

430
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,080
configuration resource and publish and

431
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,820
subscribe on the data resource this

432
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,730
gives us a clear separation of the

433
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,649
management of the topic from the

434
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:54,330
transfer of data through the topic and

435
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:56,399
it gives us some more restful

436
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,460
interaction model around topic control

437
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:01,199
than we had before with just links also

438
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,029
there's an opportunity to improve the

439
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,330
security because you may not have really

440
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,420
this

441
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,530
access control for managing topics that

442
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,340
you do for publishing and subscribing

443
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:14,399
through them and there's a proposal in

444
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,980
the github repo that that describes it

445
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,920
so the topic configuration is a Korell

446
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,800
document so we're beginning to include

447
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,660
coral as that we had to pick a format so

448
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,870
coral is the the best one coming up

449
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,880
that's supported by ETF and in core apps

450
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:33,030
so that's that's what we decided to use

451
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,890
but also you can still use link format

452
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:38,250
and the fact that we have an underlying

453
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,560
coral document makes it easier to have

454
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,440
some sensible defaults for just using

455
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,929
link format to create topics so a topic

456
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,110
creator someone using pub/sub has not

457
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:51,600
need to know coral to use it in a simple

458
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,409
fashion but should use coral documents

459
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,629
if they want to do more sophisticated

460
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:00,650
control so basically when you create a

461
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:04,430
topic you get a configuration resource

462
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:08,850
and when you publish to a topic that

463
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:11,370
creates a data resource the topic is not

464
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:15,870
discoverable and it's not subscribable

465
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:17,969
until it's been created so we're

466
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:21,449
probably looking at actually returning

467
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:23,400
405 method not allowed which is I can't

468
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,320
get I can I could put to it I can

469
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,760
publish but I can't do again I can't or

470
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,800
do it yet or observe and I can't

471
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:34,320
subscribed yet alright and also then

472
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,290
when you create a topic you have a way

473
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,909
now with coral document to include

474
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,399
content so you can actually do your

475
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:48,090
first publish at the same in the same

476
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:50,190
operation as the creation the topic

477
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:53,100
configuration resource contains topic

478
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:57,770
metadata such as location creation time

479
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:00,750
publish time lifetimes descriptions

480
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:04,590
content formats and the current topic

481
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:06,450
state the client can supply a hint for

482
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,610
what it wants the path to look like and

483
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,300
the server could could do that if it if

484
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:14,580
it can and also representations for

485
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,800
first publish and representations for

486
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,139
tombstone which is sort of a way of

487
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,740
sending a special representation that

488
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,290
says that the data are no longer valid

489
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,290
of course that's content format specific

490
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,879
so there's a limited amount that we can

491
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:33,320
normally specify in our document about

492
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,090
that more about that later though

493
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,580
creating attack topic involves

494
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:41,550
submitting a Korell document to an entry

495
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,980
point in the rest api you can accept a

496
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:46,639
Korell document back that returns this

497
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:50,760
stuff that was on the previous slide

498
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,320
along with the location in the header so

499
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,690
it's typical rest pattern you to create

500
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,220
you get a location back here's where you

501
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,310
can find the thing that was created

502
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,510
we're going to return a document in the

503
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:06,419
payload also on creation that contains

504
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:09,510
some of that metadata as well and the

505
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:12,990
submitted document may as I mentioned

506
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:16,379
earlier may contain a link or embedded

507
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:17,850
content for the first publish optionally

508
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,010
you can just submit a link format

509
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,070
document to create a path and there will

510
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:27,540
be sorry to create a topic and there

511
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:29,730
will be some sensible defaults and then

512
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,070
you get a link format document back that

513
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:37,350
contains a link to it's a data resource

514
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:39,960
that then you can publish to discovering

515
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,330
topics you can ask for coral or link

516
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,550
format if you ask for coral you'll going

517
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,840
to get the metadata if you ask for a

518
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,050
link format you're just going to get

519
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,030
pointers yeah

520
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,740
topics are only discoverable after

521
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,540
they've been published but that has

522
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,640
their they're really only subscribable

523
00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:01,590
there's there's going to be a way for a

524
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,260
publisher to publish we need to provide

525
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,879
that so topic discovery has some

526
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,810
built-in filters like the stuff we

527
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:14,250
define in RFC 66 90 RTI F things like

528
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:17,220
that if you want to do more you can use

529
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:20,100
fetch and coral and so you can provide

530
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,200
the fields that you want to filter on in

531
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:28,560
a coral document and use fetch and then

532
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,010
filter that way so discovery you can use

533
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,200
both

534
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:34,260
quarrel or link fat format documents

535
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,470
thereby and the results of discovery

536
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:40,200
contains a list of links or configurate

537
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,630
configuration represent representations

538
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,410
configuration resource representations

539
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:48,150
if you want

540
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:49,620
chloral we've simplified the lifetime

541
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,419
handling because we don't have to try to

542
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,280
fit it into query parameters or anything

543
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:56,610
like that now we can just have them to

544
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,230
be fields in the Kuril document and of

545
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,918
course they'll be reasonable defaults

546
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:04,260
for those if you don't use coral also if

547
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,400
you're going to use data lifetime so so

548
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:10,470
basically data lifetimes

549
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,090
probably will require a tombstone

550
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,000
document or some kind of representation

551
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:18,449
to send out otherwise there isn't really

552
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,669
a good way but then we thought maybe 405

553
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,880
might be a way to to indicate the data

554
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:26,160
lifetime has expired to clients as well

555
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,179
saying you know method not allowed so

556
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,360
you're observing and you're getting

557
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:33,000
responses back and then then data times

558
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,590
out you might get a 405 saying you can't

559
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,370
really observe any more because the data

560
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:42,270
are stale same thing with the GATT it

561
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,070
might end up being 405 the topic timeout

562
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,929
if the topic times out and you haven't

563
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,240
published it a refresh yet in a certain

564
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:54,030
amount of time then that would result in

565
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,040
the 404 the configuration management of

566
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:58,168
topics I think we covered most of this

567
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,809
already but basically that the Korell

568
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:02,880
document is how you manage topics you

569
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:05,280
can get to look at the current state you

570
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,710
can patch to update individual fields

571
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,470
and you can observe if you want to see

572
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:16,530
when the topic state or configuration

573
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:19,350
state changes publish and subscribe work

574
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:23,610
this pretty much the same way they do in

575
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:25,980
the current draft that is standard crud

576
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,110
semantics which get input you publish or

577
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,590
write using put you read using get and

578
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:33,389
subscribe using observe so a publisher

579
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,520
subscriber doesn't need to have anything

580
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,250
more than the basic co-op library to

581
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,530
work with pubs up

582
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:45,150
so um a couple of additional features

583
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:46,918
were still sort of in InDesign on them

584
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,960
and that is a topic hierarchy we've

585
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,940
announced about can can cut topics still

586
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,960
be a hierarchy kanya parent topics and

587
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,690
child topics and yeah probably yes that

588
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,760
what we would need to do would be to

589
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:03,330
allow the topic to be an entry point for

590
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,039
creating and then that has some

591
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:07,620
advantages in that if you've already set

592
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,449
the configuration resource for the

593
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,270
parent topic the child topics could

594
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:14,399
inherit that data and you could then

595
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:16,619
sort of set up your broker using chloral

596
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,659
but have your topic creators just use

597
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:22,889
link format and use those defaults that

598
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,659
you like deleting the parent topic would

599
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,570
of course delete all the subtopics and

600
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:31,020
then if you did a read on them or

601
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,730
subscribe or subscribe observe on the

602
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,929
parent topic you would get all those

603
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:39,030
subtopics also the other idea that's

604
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,220
similar to this is an aggregation topic

605
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,050
and the idea is that if you have a bunch

606
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,149
of topics already created you can create

607
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,490
a new topic that sort of works like a

608
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:50,250
like the the parent topic but it can

609
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:52,739
have any any any other topics in it it's

610
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,050
just a collection of topics so it's sort

611
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,000
of more like flat aggregation and then

612
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,580
if you did the read the Kuril document

613
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,630
would contain all of those

614
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,150
representations of all of those things

615
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:05,460
that you want to be aggregated in read

616
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,230
em and in notify and of course there's

617
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,240
the idea there that was notify you could

618
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,369
get all the data even the ones that

619
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,259
haven't changed or maybe just the ones

620
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,270
that have changed and there seem to be

621
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,859
some use cases for both those behaviors

622
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,080
and we could pick one or make it

623
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:21,650
configurable anyway these last two

624
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:26,040
features are sort of under consideration

625
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:30,000
and being designed I think that's the

626
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,770
last slide right where are we going and

627
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,330
what are we doing so what we want to do

628
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,940
is kind of get rough consensus on this

629
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,220
protocol now so we can go ahead and

630
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,710
proceed with the detail design and

631
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,140
updating the draft and we'll expect to

632
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:46,170
have a couple of core interim meetings

633
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:49,470
where we can discuss our revisions to

634
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:53,359
the draft and drive it to our last call

635
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,359
because that people want to use this

636
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:08,770
thank you for everybody is to thinking

637
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:11,009
about this well the Russians movies it's

638
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,009
done

639
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:22,689
hi I I'm not sure if not one of the nice

640
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,400
things but in you duties and topics

641
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,410
don't really exist in the server they're

642
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,910
just they're just data structures take a

643
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:30,490
consultant when that message comes in so

644
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,089
you can create billions of topics of

645
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:36,399
course this really take up any resources

646
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,750
and it looks like the protocol is moving

647
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,420
towards structure if they where that

648
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:45,960
might be impossible to do so I was just

649
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,960
wondering you've considered that so just

650
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:52,810
I'm not sure what what will you say at

651
00:36:49,720 --> 00:37:00,759
first what how is it that topics don't

652
00:36:52,810 --> 00:37:03,220
use any resources because clients are

653
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,010
typically subscribing with wildcards so

654
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,330
the server takes to set up wildcards

655
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:14,410
it's the it's the set of all cards that

656
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:16,569
exists as resources not the topics so so

657
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:20,710
we're considering some designs that did

658
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:23,290
allow wildcards subscription in the in

659
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:27,100
the fashion of mqtt but I can say plus

660
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:29,140
in the as a past segment we don't have a

661
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,850
design to propose for that but it would

662
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,770
be happy to collect requirements and

663
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:36,580
then kind of like to have a little more

664
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:39,190
discussion about what your you know use

665
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:42,700
case is and what how you think we might

666
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:57,070
might do it maybe yeah yeah we

667
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:58,779
definitely want it to be scalable when

668
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:01,090
you mentioned the two options the

669
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,700
hierarchy and will be flat Lisp sort of

670
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,470
idea you didn't touch on the idea of

671
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,779
lifecycle

672
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:08,580
containment or ownership you did say

673
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,290
that when you delete the parent topic it

674
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,869
deletes the children but what about the

675
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,970
flat list is that like a view we're

676
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,070
deleting the view doesn't delete the

677
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:22,980
members yeah that would that would

678
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:26,340
probably yes yes that would be more like

679
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,250
a view where you were you don't expect

680
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:34,320
to be able to delete everything like you

681
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:36,359
would with the hierarchy those members

682
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:45,869
whereas the client it doesn't get to the

683
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:47,819
final populate its more like another

684
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:50,640
topic creation and so you would need to

685
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:53,119
have topic creation rights on the broker

686
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,540
and you would create a topic that then

687
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:00,859
contained a link links to all of the

688
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,859
subtopics that you wanted to aggregate

689
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,320
you just mentioned about well what if

690
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:24,060
the lifetimes are in different places on

691
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:31,680
different ones what happens with the

692
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:33,630
parent and good good good points right

693
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:42,089
that's why these features are in design

694
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:45,920
and those things like the flat lists

695
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:50,339
could be could be extensions to the

696
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,140
opposite broker and Nokia is a required

697
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:55,790
feature there so you could have popped

698
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,970
the protis the supports on bottom right

699
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,650
right

700
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:09,569
some of these things that not everything

701
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:11,670
is going to be required clarifying

702
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:13,500
question please how do you see the

703
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,870
relation is the work which goes on an

704
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,640
ace for the public

705
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:21,200
the authorization of access to the

706
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,629
program so do you think you talk to a

707
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,700
very blue classical means that also

708
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,440
that's a draft testicle to be recouped

709
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,089
Lesko at the same time

710
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,340
so what are we creating a dependency on

711
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:36,440
on ace where we're creating a dependency

712
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,940
probably on some of the choral stuff but

713
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm not sure we're creating a dependency

714
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:46,190
on ace but the correct solution will

715
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,050
probably be ace four for this because

716
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:55,970
they're building the pattern that will

717
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:58,970
will do this so answer the question how

718
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:02,299
do you secure that in the document so it

719
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:05,120
suddenly would be good if we finish this

720
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:09,140
together with the authorization scheme

721
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:11,569
in ace so probably the she has at some

722
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:13,850
point I have two assistants from the

723
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,680
draft seem to depend on each other I

724
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:19,480
would have expected that you also have

725
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,480
to finish that the same thing you know

726
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,120
this will be shorter so we're also

727
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,800
updating dine link and we had some

728
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,009
similar issues with dine Lincoln

729
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,510
questions so we have some some similar

730
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:45,740
small issue redesign that we've done

731
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,900
pretty much we were looking at the

732
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,370
binding table operations and how to do

733
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,620
the binding table and we've got a great

734
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:54,080
suggestion from Christian on how to

735
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:58,640
architect this so this is what we're

736
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:01,160
proposing there's also some question of

737
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,910
how the observe attributes work when you

738
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:10,730
have a use case that requires more data

739
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:13,129
consistency across different endpoints

740
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,660
and we're probably not going to get too

741
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,190
much in that discussion right now but

742
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,770
just aware that that's happening and

743
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:21,590
we'll have that on the list there's some

744
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,480
ongoing discussion about maybe adding

745
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:27,780
new attributes to satisfy those and

746
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,250
there's a proposal in the in the repo so

747
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,290
basically what we want to do is make the

748
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,520
dining a resource instead of just a link

749
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,710
and be a resource in a collection that's

750
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,440
the binding table collection of binding

751
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,600
resources and the binding table has an

752
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,410
entry point for creating resources like

753
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:48,450
the present draft and again we're

754
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,920
looking at using chloral to be able to

755
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:52,649
do some things that are a little more

756
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,380
sophisticated but link format will still

757
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,630
do the job and creating an entry in the

758
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,300
binding table will return a location for

759
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,400
the binding you created the binding

760
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,320
resource then basically has a set of

761
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,960
links there's a source link destination

762
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:11,670
link in a self link to the binding

763
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,590
itself just as shown here and then that

764
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,990
the issue of what's a target attribute

765
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:19,770
now is resolved because the target

766
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:22,140
attributes in each link only refer to

767
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,150
the target of that link that that's how

768
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,220
we've got the the self link for the

769
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:29,400
binding now is referring to the binding

770
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,109
itself as the target attributes in the

771
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,670
link referred to now the binding so

772
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,200
there's no ambiguity about whether the

773
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:43,590
attributes refer to the source or

774
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:45,120
destination or the link right so the

775
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,790
binding table as I said is a collection

776
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,140
of binding resources has an entry point

777
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,420
returns the location and that's a little

778
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,240
snippet of our API description that says

779
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,850
you post to it in link format with this

780
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,270
payload you get a created response with

781
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:03,509
the location and that location then

782
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:06,090
allows you to delete if you have the

783
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:08,640
coral you can use that location to patch

784
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:11,280
the binding and update it without

785
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,930
deleting it and recreating it reading

786
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,750
the binding table would return a list of

787
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:17,700
links to the current bindings so in link

788
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,560
format that would basically just be some

789
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,470
links but in coral maybe we could do

790
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:25,230
some depth recursion on that and get

791
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:27,000
maybe a way to return more of the

792
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,390
information so you could do one read and

793
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,400
inspect all of the bindings on the table

794
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:36,200
tour filter or whatever but at least we

795
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,580
can do this the condition will observe a

796
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,899
option is that different clients might

797
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,610
have different starting conditions

798
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,740
different

799
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,750
and so what what you could end up with

800
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,830
is a different sequence of notification

801
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:51,680
across the different clients and

802
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:54,020
sometimes that's okay maybe sometimes

803
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,700
it's not if I really expect them doing

804
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,070
machine control or something like that

805
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,080
you may want to have some observe

806
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:03,260
attributes that guarantee or at least do

807
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:05,690
the best under the constraints of coop

808
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,810
observe to deliver the same set of

809
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:11,240
notifications to all of the observers so

810
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:13,310
are some of the ideas were absolute some

811
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,049
absolute based things instead of the

812
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:18,140
relative based things that we specify

813
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:20,510
now and maybe some behavioral

814
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:22,640
constraints that say when you notify one

815
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,980
observer you have to notify all of them

816
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,310
or some set of them that that are

817
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:31,580
sharing some notification regime I see

818
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:35,060
some confused looks but I try to

819
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:39,799
summarize what the issue is and it's it

820
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:43,040
has a few nuances so our roadmap here is

821
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:45,260
to add the binding table changes if we

822
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,420
have consensus if no one really objects

823
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,220
spoke will do those changes and then

824
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,810
will will need to have some further

825
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,060
discussion on this issue within

826
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:55,070
conditional notification attributes and

827
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,600
how we what we need to do with that how

828
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,760
we need to redesign them whether we need

829
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,620
new attributes whether we need to remove

830
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,470
some of the current attributes if we

831
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:06,529
don't like them and that's and then you

832
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:08,689
know maybe reliable notification once we

833
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,070
can to this machine control or whatever

834
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,660
we might want to look at something like

835
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,960
series transfer pattern to do

836
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:17,660
notifications and what we want to do is

837
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,900
roll these in and again we review at the

838
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,580
interim meetings and you know drive

839
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,590
toward last call on this now this is

840
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,650
currently I believe in informational

841
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:33,220
drafts so there was some question also

842
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:36,080
about whether it should be normative

843
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:39,500
that right and Carsten is it information

844
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,900
yes yeah some some people might want it

845
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,210
to be what do you call if it's not

846
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,280
informational normative or we have a

847
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,640
word for s3 sorry

848
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,110
oh no standards track okay yeah so we

849
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,609
may want to do what since people are

850
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,060
using it there's those attributes are

851
00:46:52,610 --> 00:47:01,850
being used in Oh

852
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:04,980
now for example it's time for for

853
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:09,360
general discussion which of these graphs

854
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:15,320
actually standards in the traditional

855
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,320
sense which example

856
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,219
[Music]

857
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,389
[Music]

858
00:49:48,979 --> 00:50:04,229
version that is used instead of seats

859
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:08,190
and something that was reported on the

860
00:50:04,229 --> 00:50:13,499
mailing list in connection to values

861
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:16,410
that they're inside unions this could

862
00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:22,169
cost some problems if serious and that's

863
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:24,359
why we in this specific case we stated

864
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:28,739
that names should be use in order to

865
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:34,828
avoid this ambiguity and similarly for

866
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:37,979
the unions of beats and again we

867
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:42,920
clarified how namespaces should be used

868
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:42,919
inside instance identifiers

869
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:58,399
yeah here should be fine okay so then

870
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:02,510
for the tech registry we have a new tag

871
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:06,380
that defines if someone wants to use sit

872
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:09,320
directly instead of Delta this is now

873
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:13,820
possible and there is a sit tag for this

874
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:16,670
and also the seat values before were not

875
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:31,430
given now we have specific values for

876
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:35,630
each seat tag for each terminology per

877
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:41,240
tent we are clarifying how date and

878
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:44,830
deltas are used and we will be sorry

879
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:48,680
well making it a little bit less

880
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:53,390
confusing for the examples where

881
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:55,399
sometimes we have plus signs and this is

882
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,379
not exactly clear for some of the

883
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,820
readers how they should interpret this

884
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:07,010
so we're resolving this and there's very

885
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:13,520
small editorial changes so here we have

886
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:16,820
a small example that seemed to be I mean

887
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,930
the format seem to be causing some small

888
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:24,680
confusion whether the interesting part

889
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:27,230
is the one that is in flight cream this

890
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,589
is what is being specified in the given

891
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:34,310
place but in order for it to be properly

892
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:36,970
interpreted we need to give some context

893
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:41,720
and this is why we have the rest of the

894
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:44,029
example so if people find this confusing

895
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,230
please report it on the mailing list

896
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:55,170
otherwise for us it's well explained so

897
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:57,750
we will keep it as it is and so okay

898
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:01,250
at the end to ask whether it's okay for

899
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:05,870
walking grouped Alaska and then for the

900
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:10,500
yank Library draft it was in working

901
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:16,170
group adoption Co but as Carson said and

902
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:20,730
the Beermen had some uncertainty whether

903
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:26,250
it's the best way forward as so if you

904
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:31,170
want maybe now we can you've got this so

905
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:34,530
for us which it seemed that we are we

906
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:38,100
will be reducing significantly the size

907
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:42,600
of the discovery for devices and

908
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:45,480
especially in networks were there will

909
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:50,160
be peer-to-peer communication this could

910
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:52,080
be rather important my understanding for

911
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,640
the point that Andy's making is that

912
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:58,710
this will happen only once and normally

913
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,490
in the lifetime of a device and that

914
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:08,190
this s maybe doesn't matter that much so

915
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:13,169
maybe it's not worth as specifying the

916
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:18,930
how to use again Clara with seats so

917
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:25,830
this is my understanding of they show if

918
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:31,980
anyone is opinion different spin on the

919
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:37,009
issue we spend a lot of time to make the

920
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:41,640
communication about yang efficient civil

921
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:46,020
so we can exchange again for the data

922
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:49,410
efficiently however occasionally we have

923
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:55,500
to do introspection so we kind of have a

924
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:59,790
metal use of Yang and this introspection

925
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:02,790
we haven't optimized and of course here

926
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:05,779
regularly we could change yang zero to

927
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:07,680
two also have an optimized introspection

928
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:12,770
mechanism

929
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:15,359
but maybe it's just easier to say okay

930
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:20,400
the kind of introspection we are going

931
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:22,650
to do go on constrain senator is going

932
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,380
to be a bit different anyway from what

933
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:30,150
you would do on a large net current

934
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:34,130
based router or something like that so

935
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:38,370
maybe it's okay if we have our own young

936
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:42,030
module for introspection so that's

937
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:45,750
essentially the the slight difference we

938
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:48,540
have with Andy here so fundamentally

939
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:52,790
there is nothing that we is speaking

940
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:56,580
against using the standard introspection

941
00:55:52,790 --> 00:56:00,270
library but we are going to get much

942
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:04,740
larger discovery information from that

943
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:07,770
then from this optimized may be any

944
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:11,189
issue is kind of we wanted to use this

945
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:14,850
in the whole spectrum of young usage and

946
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:17,580
so for a tank it doesn't really make a

947
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:22,890
big difference whether the introspection

948
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:24,990
don't you - 200 - oh - okay but for for

949
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,359
temperature sensor doesn't make a

950
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:29,700
difference in particular was

951
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:32,460
fragmentation and all that so that may

952
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:38,640
be the explanation for the slight

953
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:42,000
difference in view we have here so

954
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,680
having said that my partner he was that

955
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:51,090
we should go ahead with the working

956
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:55,580
group adoption and we will be last

957
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:59,120
calling these documents with a special

958
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:01,230
CC to the net water in that country

959
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:06,000
working groups and I think we will

960
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:08,640
collect additional input on on this from

961
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,440
them during the working on grass court

962
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:15,799
so we can still stop this if there are

963
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,610
good arguments why why this would

964
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,610
destroy the young universe

965
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:24,140
like that then of course we should I do

966
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,360
this

967
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:30,549
but for me right now it seems this is

968
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,550
the right way to do this and we have a

969
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:40,450
girl hello can you hear me yes yes

970
00:57:50,530 --> 00:58:10,280
anyway device to be having to be

971
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:13,070
implementing the standard IETF yang

972
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,350
introspection module which could be then

973
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:19,330
fetched from a big server right or from

974
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:23,319
a big client and then tiny

975
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:26,600
implementations to use the core yang

976
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,340
library so in this way you know if

977
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,770
you're a big server and then in any case

978
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:35,450
you can use the standard library and if

979
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:38,480
you want very limited very optimized

980
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:42,680
version then you can only go and get

981
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,860
into say so also from this command I

982
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,930
think they're not incompatible so I

983
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:50,930
think it's the the so my personal

984
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:53,359
opinion is to of course copy net not and

985
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:56,540
you know dive a little bit more into

986
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,370
this how the two libraries coexist but

987
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,890
there is not no incompatibility between

988
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:07,190
them and is I think that they can

989
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:23,509
coexist very nice thank you we just

990
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:26,300
point out that nobody send plus one okay

991
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:33,910
I saw them for

992
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:39,500
come I came no big changes based on some

993
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:43,069
reviews from the mailing list we have

994
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:46,160
changed some small things one of the

995
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:51,130
things is we renamed commit to core

996
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:56,390
confess it has been discussed then we

997
00:59:51,130 --> 01:00:00,320
move I mean we used the ant models that

998
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:04,520
are referenced from existing terraces

999
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:09,440
instead of us redefining them in our

1000
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:15,530
appendix which sounded a better way of

1001
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:18,620
doing it in some examples and then there

1002
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:29,180
is some more information about how to do

1003
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:33,080
filtering and the seat definition of the

1004
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:44,779
young model was moved us said oh so for

1005
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:48,890
the seat draft outside of this draft so

1006
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,390
the important parts are that we have

1007
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:54,350
done some clarifications on

1008
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:58,310
notifications on the discovery and on

1009
01:00:54,350 --> 01:01:02,390
the seat deltas but otherwise some very

1010
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:05,360
minor readability improvements only

1011
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:20,750
editorial changes nothing big has

1012
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:25,700
changed yes I think it will be available

1013
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:34,700
by tomorrow but yeah no money tomorrow

1014
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:37,270
it will be ready to review and then we

1015
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,270
can send

1016
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,750
Peter doesn't want us to do that it's

1017
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:48,550
quite a call to me but maybe my couples

1018
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:50,380
to see me I'm very happy that the

1019
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:51,400
documents are far advanced you were

1020
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,530
really looking forward to this

1021
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,800
publications we want to use it as such

1022
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,960
we have still worried that's about the

1023
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,210
process of in disabilities are changed

1024
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,890
it's not quite clear how the

1025
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:06,130
communication is yeah that's going to

1026
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:08,259
help of enemy have specific numbers and

1027
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:11,470
you used to be known you test then it

1028
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:20,470
goes through our line and RFC bomb so

1029
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:24,939
all the numbers changing so yeah for the

1030
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:29,919
changes that's why we said that there

1031
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:32,860
could be pre a location so I think that

1032
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:36,450
use cases could be handled but if you

1033
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:36,450
want to can discuss this so fine and

1034
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:53,770
standing by me asking for his ship those

1035
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:56,050
to be fixed okay Mike Richardson I think

1036
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:58,630
that the discussion I had with Michelle

1037
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:03,369
cotton yesterday and Benoit on the

1038
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:06,580
weekend suggests that all of them yang

1039
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:09,730
models that we depend upon may needs in

1040
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,960
values attached to them so that's

1041
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:14,380
something that's going to have to happen

1042
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:17,109
the SID files that we create we believe

1043
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:20,050
that we need to pass them - Ayanna if

1044
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:22,990
you manage we don't know how to do that

1045
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,910
we passed game files Diana by putting

1046
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:27,729
them in our document and then the

1047
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:31,660
extractor is bizarre that's what we do

1048
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:34,540
should we do that with city files we

1049
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:38,920
don't know okay the second point is that

1050
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:42,940
there is a worried Benoit has that when

1051
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:45,340
we run came - - said etc over the

1052
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:48,880
archive of all of the other modules that

1053
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:49,950
have already been approved we may

1054
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,370
discover

1055
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:55,520
issue

1056
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:57,970
conflicts something else and that it may

1057
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:02,630
be that we need to do that at some point

1058
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:05,629
probably between last working group last

1059
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:08,450
call and iesg to convince the young

1060
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:09,950
people that everything is good so I

1061
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:13,129
don't think we have a process for that

1062
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:16,640
and I also know that we don't have our

1063
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:18,530
code up streamed into gang again so that

1064
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,750
it will be can trivially do this and

1065
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:24,350
again I contribute check it out right

1066
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:26,450
now so that's a mechanical thing that we

1067
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:31,100
need to just be aware of or need to work

1068
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:33,020
out but with the exception I think we

1069
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:35,630
have to have text to explain to i anna

1070
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:37,040
in i ana considerations and some

1071
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:39,350
agreement about what's going to happen

1072
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,210
there that's why a lot working group

1073
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:42,710
last call comment let's put it over here

1074
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:44,600
group black hole and that's how that

1075
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:49,780
happened but we're gonna have to have a

1076
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,779
discussion with vienna about this okay
