1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,809
that's frickin go ahead and get started

2
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:28,100
okay I got this okay so we're gonna go

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,660
ahead and get started so this I'd like

4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,210
to welcome everybody to the writing

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,550
security considerations tutorial I am

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,210
Karen O'Donoghue from the edge you team

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,040
and we provide the tutorials the

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,079
newcomers overview and a number of the

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,930
other things related to general training

10
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,940
in the IETF if you have any suggestions

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,610
or comments about things that you think

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:54,410
we need to do there is a mailing list

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:55,780
edu - te am a Jew team and we would

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,099
welcome any suggestions that you have

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,590
also at the end of this there's going to

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,899
be a link to a survey we do actually

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,460
look at the survey results and so I'd

18
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,780
really appreciate any feedback you have

19
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,309
there and if you have any suggestions

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,929
for future tutorials you can also put

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:15,259
those in there as well so with that I'm

22
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:18,829
going to introduce that our two speakers

23
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:26,479
for today Yoav and and linda and good

24
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:30,079
luck with your tutorial hi yeah okay my

25
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,380
name is jeff near Linda we're both on

26
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,749
second year which is the body that

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:40,039
reviews all draft scintillant for

28
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:42,679
publication for security issues and one

29
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,299
of the big things that we do is we

30
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:47,479
review the security considerations

31
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,209
section in every draft and we often see

32
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,770
a lot of things we don't like there so

33
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:54,079
you've come up with this tutorial team

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,319
hopefully make the things a little

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,318
better

36
00:01:56,529 --> 00:02:01,939
okay so motivation why do we actually

37
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:05,238
what do we even write security

38
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,859
consideration sections so the first

39
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,660
thing is that security is relevant to

40
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,380
all protocols not just those that come

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,880
out of the security area

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,190
it's obviously why we need protocols

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,250
like IP TCP and the stuff that comes out

44
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:22,250
of the security area like TLS or IPSec

45
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,130
to be secure because they're used by

46
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,350
everyone there into the cryptography so

47
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:30,530
there are important stuff but other

48
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,299
protocols also need to be secure I mean

49
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,350
you could have the best security with

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,500
TLS and still if you layer HTTP on top

51
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,560
of that if you can still give up all the

52
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,050
security yeah yeah the TLS

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,090
notwithstanding so tears will not solve

54
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,750
all your problems specifically it's not

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,000
going to solve the issues of credentials

56
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,650
so there's a lot of stuff about

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,460
implementation and deployment issues

58
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,570
that are not covered well in many

59
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:04,220
documents that we get Oh as always feel

60
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,609
free to run to the mic and ask questions

61
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:12,230
if if you want don't have to wait to to

62
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,030
the end so now the security of a system

63
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,760
depends not just on using good crypto

64
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,250
which TLS and IPSec will provide you but

65
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,769
also in dispensing identities and

66
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,020
credentials and verifying them so

67
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,670
suppose you have the protocol and you

68
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,650
decided to use certificates to

69
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,190
authenticate all the nodes within the

70
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,440
system great but who issues the

71
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,030
certificates how does the CA that is

72
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,770
going to sign the certificate to verify

73
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,200
that whoever asked for the certificate

74
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,200
whether since the certificate signing

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,470
request is actually who they claimed to

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,780
be

77
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,510
how are the private keys secure now this

78
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,160
part is not really usually ITF domain

79
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,320
but it's also important for the system

80
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,260
and when one node connects to another

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,030
how does the other node first validate

82
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,170
the certificate and then what how does

83
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,840
it validate that the name in the

84
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:07,279
certificate and how does that map to

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,440
authorization and more motivation well

86
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,720
sector review is part of the document

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,430
publications process whether you like it

88
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,640
or not you're going to get a sector

89
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,280
review so and the security area

90
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,810
directors always read the sector review

91
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,809
and if you don't

92
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:25,840
respond to the secretary of you just

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,759
ignore it

94
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,179
well you're going to get blocks or

95
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,909
discusses so don't ignore the secretary

96
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,250
views secretary viewers will read your

97
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:38,590
entire document usually there have been

98
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,710
six hundred page documents that we

99
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,780
haven't really read every page of but we

100
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,169
definitely do read these security

101
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,270
consideration section so please make it

102
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:51,698
the way it should be so it's not just a

103
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,150
good idea it's the law and by law I mean

104
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,610
it's enshrined in an RFC so RFC twenty

105
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:01,419
two twenty three still valid still not

106
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,780
obsoleted has section nine that's it in

107
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:06,190
in its entirety all RFC's must contain a

108
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,419
section near the end of the document

109
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,580
that discusses the security

110
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:11,229
considerations of the protocol or

111
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:17,919
procedures that are the main topic of

112
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:21,340
the RFC so you have to have it piece of

113
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,840
advice is write them early don't leave

114
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,739
writing them to the end of the process

115
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,849
because sometimes when you write the

116
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,669
security consideration section you say

117
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:32,110
oh my well this is drew well we have to

118
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,620
go back and revise and you don't want to

119
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,969
do that when you've already decided that

120
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,130
the document is ready and you're ready

121
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:42,099
to send it to the is G just have to

122
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,779
write this these sections that are

123
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,729
missing the Ayana considerations and

124
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:48,639
these security considers now don't do it

125
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,680
that late another thing if you think

126
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,169
that there going to be some contentious

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,569
issues ask for a sec to review early

128
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,628
it's a few clicks on the website on the

129
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:01,000
data tracker especially if you are

130
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:06,759
working group chair please ask for an

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,740
early review and they can help okay how

132
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,710
do we get here

133
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,030
bit of history so once upon a time and

134
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,409
you always hear that Oh at this

135
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,659
beginning of the internet they didn't

136
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,980
consider security and it's sort of

137
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,690
correct and or at least they assumed

138
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,360
that the security is either there or not

139
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,370
needed and a lot of RFC did not have

140
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,320
security considerations at all in them

141
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:30,010
and a lot of people didn't think about

142
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,099
security when designing protocols so RFC

143
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,960
22 23 to mentioned earlier required

144
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,400
security consideration checksum and this

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,349
goes back to 1997 so then people didn't

146
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,849
really know what to write and they made

147
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:52,300
somewhere really wrong things in there

148
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:54,040
so in 2003 we had RFC 3550 - that's just

149
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,860
guidance on writing security

150
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,340
consideration section and this is quite

151
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,730
a big RFC it's a little outdated here

152
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,590
but by now but erm it's still mostly

153
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,410
relevant not entirely and we try to

154
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,820
update it a few years ago and

155
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,760
unfortunately we fail we can get their

156
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,190
mass of people to review and comment and

157
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:20,200
offer text so that effort just died

158
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:21,880
unfortunately so at the moment this is

159
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,320
what you haven't the internet threat

160
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:30,700
model is taken from RFC 3550 - and you

161
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,969
are encouraged to read that document ok

162
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:38,440
so they even a threat model as described

163
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:40,480
in RFC 3550 - includes that it's about

164
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,140
connections going all over the internet

165
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:47,230
and you assume that the attacker may be

166
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,169
may be in any place on them and on the

167
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:54,780
path so the attacker can modify any

168
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:59,080
packet drop any packet spoof any packet

169
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,059
so never assume that the path is secure

170
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,050
if you want security you have to do it

171
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:07,120
between the two points and you should

172
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,610
also consider things that have evolved

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,350
since then the difference between off

174
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:15,100
path and on path attackers it's

175
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,500
described in RFC 74 30 and also consider

176
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,260
that the sufficiently powerful taifa

177
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,150
Tucker can become on path by pretty much

178
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,949
convincing the Internet to

179
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,448
get your packets to go through that

180
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,190
truly something controlled by the

181
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:31,419
attacker and lots of ways of doing that

182
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,360
also considered privacy considerations

183
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:39,210
which became more important in recent

184
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,289
years see RFC 69 73 about that and

185
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,440
pervasive monitoring that we've started

186
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:48,819
worrying about relatively late

187
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,250
that's an RC 7258 in trust trust is

188
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,490
important thing to consider because one

189
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,430
of the best ways of getting an angry

190
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,600
comment on a sector review is saying

191
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,540
node a is trusted

192
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,330
what do you mean trusted who trusts it

193
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:09,040
trusted to do what so it's always a

194
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:13,360
trust B to do C never just be as trusted

195
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,670
it's never good enough even CAS CAS are

196
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,580
not trusted they're trusted by specific

197
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:21,640
people to do specific things I mean if

198
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:25,240
you look at even at what PKI and that's

199
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,310
a lot of CAS there there's the famously

200
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,860
there's the South African post office

201
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,430
when did I ever trust this South African

202
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,430
post office I never did well Apple and

203
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,670
and Google and Microsoft decided for me

204
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,589
that these are trusted things so on

205
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:46,709
really trusting Microsoft and Apple and

206
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:50,350
Google to decide well who is trusted

207
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:53,439
okay well trusted at least for browsing

208
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:58,600
the web okay so questions you should ask

209
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,300
and all this is material from 3552 what

210
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,709
you know how much Dean do you need

211
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,290
confidentiality do you need data

212
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,180
integrity do you need per entity

213
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,699
authentication usually do otherwise

214
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:13,900
you're just sending stuff to anyone on

215
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,700
the internet so are the messages really

216
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,949
expected from peers rather from

217
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,320
attackers and are the message really

218
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,839
sent from the expected peers and not to

219
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,550
attackers right the security

220
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,800
consideration section needs to explain

221
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,750
which attacks are in scope and which are

222
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,990
out of scope and why are they out of

223
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,750
scope

224
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,370
and the texts that are in scope and are

225
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,440
those that the protocol is susceptible

226
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:41,899
to and that the protocol protects

227
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:44,630
against okay attacks that you need to

228
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:47,810
consider there's targets even in Walden

229
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,500
systems in your data center such as

230
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,630
router and switches that are in cages or

231
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,100
well in your data center behind the

232
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,680
firewall are susceptible to internet

233
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,570
threats because usually can get traffic

234
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,829
from the Internet to those nodes and

235
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,700
especially that they have ports that are

236
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:10,520
facing external more vulnerable targets

237
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:13,760
you should think of passive attacks like

238
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,760
sniffing and other cryptographic attacks

239
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,839
and they're common issues that of shared

240
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,689
keys there's kind of a design pattern or

241
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:27,529
an anti pattern that you have a group of

242
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:32,740
a group of hosts that all have the same

243
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:35,149
key certificates very often mismanaged

244
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,029
downwind attacks do now service attacks

245
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:46,399
firewalls all this and much more in RFC

246
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:49,040
3550 - please read it okay attacks to be

247
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,800
considered active attacks active attacks

248
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,719
are obviously require more resources but

249
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,880
we have quite a few people who can do

250
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,310
quite a few entities who can do active

251
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,829
attacks there's proof in attacks

252
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:11,750
replay attacks message insertions and

253
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:13,459
met in the middle attacks okay so what

254
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,680
has to go into the security

255
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:18,439
consideration section and the first

256
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,670
thing is that everything that tests to

257
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,279
that goes into the security

258
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,069
considerations section has to be about

259
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,959
this new stuff that you that is in your

260
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,329
document if your document is running

261
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,550
over IP you don't have to cover

262
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,660
everything that goes into IP if your

263
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,209
document your protocol runs over TCP

264
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,480
then you don't have to cover that either

265
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:43,119
yeah unless you're in the

266
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,000
transport layer and then you make

267
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,579
changes to TCP and then yeah it makes

268
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,910
sense to write what has changed in TCP

269
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:55,510
but if all I'm doing is sending some

270
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,949
kind of content over Jason I don't have

271
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,050
to describe Jason I don't have to

272
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:01,029
describe HTTP I don't have to describe

273
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,189
IP all that is in other documents

274
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:06,490
I don't even have to reference them just

275
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,930
what is new and there's always something

276
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,430
new otherwise you wouldn't be writing a

277
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:14,529
draft why would you so anything about

278
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,750
the threat environment environment

279
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,480
should go in the security considerations

280
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,430
section TCP current that is anywhere in

281
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,470
the internet maybe behind not maybe not

282
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,680
and it's connecting to a server that is

283
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,449
in the cloud or in some data center

284
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,370
that's the internet effect model you

285
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:32,050
don't have to do describe it all over

286
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,199
again because that's that's been

287
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:37,510
described many times already so if your

288
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:42,189
environment is different yeah please go

289
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,630
and describe it example yeah this

290
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,089
protocol variation inherits all the

291
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,389
security properties of regular ESP

292
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:51,839
that's the kind of hyper sec and

293
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:55,959
capsulated security as described in RFC

294
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,459
4303 okay this line is taken from a

295
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,959
draft that didn't make it to RFC in the

296
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,479
end not because of security

297
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,310
considerations it's from draft shoe

298
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,730
tik-tok security for synchronization

299
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:10,660
it's about protecting I Triple E 1588

300
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,910
now in case you don't know I believe

301
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,339
1588 also known as the precise time

302
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,260
protocol requires consistent latency

303
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:20,170
down to sub microsecond or sub

304
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,540
nanosecond jitter so when I first heard

305
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,370
that I said well any router is going to

306
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,610
give you more jitter than that and it

307
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,889
told me well yeah but our protocol it

308
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,380
doesn't go through through routers it

309
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:36,449
only goes to special switches that are

310
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,439
have constant latency and said okay this

311
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:41,769
knowing the document does it say that

312
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,000
and this is not the internet if you go

313
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:44,889
through a router you're not on writing

314
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,230
on the internet so if your environment

315
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,579
is that's different yeah you should say

316
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,589
that in the security considerations

317
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,750
everything related to a router is not

318
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,170
relevant here because we don't use

319
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,170
routers

320
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,849
okay in scope and out of scope threats

321
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,460
it's fine for a document to leave some

322
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,260
security aspects out of scope but you

323
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,190
have to say this so an example

324
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,510
protecting the endpoint against flooding

325
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,060
attacks is out of scope for this

326
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,730
document because we're running over TCP

327
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,609
right and TCP is already covered

328
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,210
elsewhere it should be mitigated with

329
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,230
normal network management procedures now

330
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,400
usually if you're running over TCP you

331
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,620
don't even have to say that because

332
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,280
that's true for any TCP so when do we

333
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,320
have to say this well as an example the

334
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,589
like the Internet's key exchange

335
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,480
protocol runs over UDP so a few years

336
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,800
ago somebody made a document for Ike

337
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,410
over TCP that makes so ICO for UDP has

338
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,729
its own anti flooding thing it's or its

339
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:49,290
own anti denied of no service RFC all

340
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,390
that goes out the window once you run

341
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,719
over TCP because then everything changes

342
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,949
so if I'm making an IKE over TCP

343
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,440
document yes I should call out that

344
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,140
everything we don't usually do with UDP

345
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05,100
out the window this should be handled

346
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:07,590
like any other TCP service so so if we

347
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,770
changed this for Ike yeah then we should

348
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:16,350
call it out otherwise no if you're just

349
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:17,579
making something over TCP okay security

350
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,950
or anything that has to do with

351
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,640
authentication goes into security

352
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,440
considerations so how is the

353
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,620
authenticating patient protected and

354
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,810
yeah we use TLS is a good answer our

355
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,230
credentials generated how are the

356
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:37,290
credential dispersed to the node how our

357
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,360
credentials and verify is protected and

358
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:42,810
this is hardly ever obvious I mean you

359
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,370
think of authentication works well in

360
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,040
the web well authentication on the web

361
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,730
is one way it's only the service the

362
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,170
clients usually don't and it's such a

363
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,900
hard problem that there's a whole

364
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:59,010
different standards organization called

365
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:01,910
the C a browser form that just has the

366
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:05,819
browsers and the cia's the name kind of

367
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:08,399
suggests that meat

368
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:13,649
several times a year sometimes virtually

369
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,570
sometimes physically to discuss how not

370
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,440
to issue certificates to the wrong

371
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:24,179
people and it's hard problem they still

372
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,770
have to meet often so what I'm saying is

373
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,690
that authentication is a hard problem

374
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,960
and if you're saying okay use

375
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,880
certificates or we'll use passwords you

376
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:39,480
should elaborate because it's really

377
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:42,810
hard to deploy residual risk if there's

378
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,820
still some risk after you have after

379
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,879
you've mitigated it with several

380
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,210
mechanisms call this out a good example

381
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,900
from RFC 52 46 that's tell us one point

382
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,640
to this well there's a paragraph before

383
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,610
that that describes how they mitigate

384
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,650
some timing and risk of but this leaves

385
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,479
a small timing channel since Mac

386
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,120
performance depends to some extent on

387
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,500
the size of the data fragment but it is

388
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,110
not believed to be large enough to be

389
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,170
exploitable because the large block size

390
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,419
for this Tmax and the small size of the

391
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,860
timing signal that's excellent text for

392
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,330
the security considerations too bad it's

393
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,010
not in the security consideration

394
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,189
section but at least they got it in

395
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,190
there

396
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,280
okay risks from foreseen and Mississippi

397
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,669
of misapplication or Mis deployment I

398
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,530
mean read your draft if you think ok

399
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,620
people are going to implement this or

400
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:42,389
deploy this in an insecure manner tell

401
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:45,810
them don't wait until they do some bad

402
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:48,240
stuff a good example from this document

403
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:52,320
the shaykhs document this is document

404
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,060
that describes how to use the sha-3 hash

405
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,639
functions often called shakes with PKI

406
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,139
so this is an excellent document that

407
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,540
provides us both with a good example

408
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,020
this one and a bad example that we'll

409
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,990
see later

410
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,780
so when using ECDSA with shakes the

411
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,540
ECDSA curve order should be chosen in

412
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,610
line with the shake output length NIST

413
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,649
has defined the appropriate use of hash

414
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:22,129
functions in SB 878 points

415
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,510
force SP 800 - 107 these documents can

416
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,170
be used as guides to choose the

417
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,330
appropriate key size in this case we

418
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:34,070
recommend that you use ID ECDSA with

419
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:38,540
Shaikh 128 with a curve of order 256

420
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:41,689
bits and ABCD si with J 256 these are

421
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,090
both algorithms that are defined in the

422
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:49,520
document is recommended for curves with

423
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:51,439
groups order 384 bits or more now these

424
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,629
curves are never mentioned in the rest

425
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,640
of document they don't say which curve

426
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,220
to use but this is good advice for

427
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,310
implementers so they don't mix

428
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:06,440
high-security shake with a high with a

429
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:09,050
low-security curve so this is good stuff

430
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,550
this is good advice and this really

431
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:14,180
should go in the security considerations

432
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:16,030
section so great for them now if you can

433
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,640
anticipate people doing something bad

434
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,170
tell them don't let them fail I mean

435
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,790
it's not enough to say this in the

436
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,870
working group because the people are

437
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,960
going to implement this are not

438
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,310
necessarily in the working group so

439
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,920
somebody gets enough seen when they tell

440
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,960
them implement this they had they're not

441
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,730
privy to all the discussion that went on

442
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,370
in the mailing list and in the room okay

443
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,750
and what's involved this is very

444
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,719
important for its engines call out

445
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:48,470
information that is sent out one time I

446
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,160
got this document to review that we had

447
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,260
an extension for protocol that I could

448
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,660
included a message with the IP address

449
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,520
of the server

450
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:02,810
this extension sent in the distant to

451
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,970
the IP address the name of the person

452
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,770
managing his email address and his phone

453
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,700
number

454
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,460
sending that over the Internet is not

455
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,160
the same as sending an IP address and it

456
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:17,480
could be okay because they'll usually

457
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,520
use not to their home email address not

458
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,820
their home phone number hopefully but

459
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,740
some helpdesk a phone number and so

460
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,010
that's it might be fine to do this but

461
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,820
call it out you're not

462
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:33,010
just because the previous protocol was

463
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,659
considered good enough doesn't mean that

464
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,070
the new information is also good enough

465
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,580
to send over the Internet

466
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,020
so if the xeo extension is sending

467
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,840
information that was not in the base

468
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,310
protocol call this out and say that it's

469
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,320
okay it might be okay I'm not saying

470
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,800
that sending any new information is bad

471
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,790
just to call it out and we'll see some

472
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,230
good in a good example in the pitfalls

473
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,420
so what does not go in this security

474
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,070
considerations obviously my

475
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,770
chocolate-chip cookies recipe doesn't go

476
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,189
in there there so this you could have a

477
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,650
lot of slides here but what we have here

478
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,290
is slide about things that we often see

479
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,090
in the security considerations

480
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:18,340
considerations a section that shouldn't

481
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:22,570
be there and most the most common one is

482
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,639
RFC 2119 language now I'm not making a

483
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,379
blanket rule that never never put a must

484
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,020
in the security considerations but

485
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,420
usually it's wrong in if something is

486
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,180
necessary to make a compliant

487
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,300
implementation of your protocol it goes

488
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,910
in other places in the document so

489
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,710
here's the wrong thing is the unique

490
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:46,750
string value mentioned in section 4 must

491
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:50,320
be 256 bits highly high-quality random

492
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:52,810
bits and the RSA key in Section 4.1 must

493
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,730
be at least three thousand 72 bits in

494
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:59,230
length and must be chosen using one of

495
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:03,670
the approved methods in SP 800 - 56 B ok

496
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:06,090
so what's wrong with that I mean I make

497
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:10,920
a compliant implementation I need to use

498
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:14,439
3072 bit RSA keys and they need to use

499
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,700
256 bit unique strings this is not

500
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,550
optional this is not something that

501
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,220
should consider so the right thing is to

502
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,110
put those requirements in Section 4 and

503
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,450
4.1 and then in the security

504
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,490
considerations checks and well say ok

505
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,110
this requirement in Section 4 is because

506
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,480
we're trying to avoid birthday attacks

507
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,699
and the requirements in Section 4.1 is

508
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,110
the current state-of-the-art assuming an

509
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,620
attacker is not a good poster in

510
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,540
large-scale quantum computer

511
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,969
phears then we don't really have a a

512
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,580
symmetric keys a symmetric algorithm at

513
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:49,140
the point at this point so yeah we're

514
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:50,970
screwed anyway so RFC 2119 language

515
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,720
usually does not go in the security

516
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:57,840
considerations section motivation we see

517
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,870
that a lot remember that I Triple E a

518
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,790
1588 craft so here's the rest of the

519
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,559
security considerations this document

520
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:08,399
described modifications or extensions

521
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,860
for the West protocol that's wrapped ESP

522
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,620
for the additional application the

523
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,909
approach described does not require

524
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,820
requires DSP the endpoints to be

525
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,309
modified to support the new protocol it

526
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,379
allows ESP receiver or intermediate node

527
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:24,270
not only to distinguish encrypted and

528
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,460
encrypted traffic but to also identify

529
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,160
whether the encrypted packets are the

530
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,860
common packets or the time packets by a

531
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:35,460
simple implementation for the transport

532
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,780
node okay this is motivation and

533
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,309
motivation goes in the introduction

534
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:43,110
doesn't go into security considerations

535
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:46,200
I mean we care a lot why you wrote this

536
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:50,580
document but this is not part of the

537
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,950
security considerations and random

538
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,500
musing remember the shaykhs thing okay

539
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,540
here's the bad part the shakes are

540
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,280
deterministic functions like any other

541
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,870
deterministic function executing

542
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,120
multiple files with the same input will

543
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,729
produce the same output therefore users

544
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,199
should not expect unrelated outputs with

545
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,330
the same or different output lengths

546
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:15,900
from running a shake function with the

547
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:17,850
same input multiple times okay and if

548
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,770
you're if you're at the level that

549
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,149
you're reading RFC I should hope you

550
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:27,530
know what the deterministic function is

551
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:29,760
and it anyway we have people coming

552
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,500
writing a document and oh we have to

553
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,870
write this security consideration

554
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:38,030
section and I have no idea what we need

555
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:40,530
to write so random musings and this

556
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,040
paragraph was deleted in it in its

557
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,610
entirety

558
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,610
we don't mean it

559
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:51,620
okay pitfalls learn from the mistakes of

560
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,150
others so the thing we see a lot is

561
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,909
security considerations by reference

562
00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:00,140
meaning this is the people say well

563
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,660
others have already covered everything

564
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,820
important here so we don't need to and

565
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,320
you see this the mapping extension

566
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,210
described in this document did not

567
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:13,010
provide any security services beyond

568
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:16,520
those described in by EPP RFC's and 5730

569
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:19,100
they EVP domain name mapping in 57:31

570
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,750
and protocol layers used by EPP the

571
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,730
security considerations described in

572
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,920
this in these other specifications

573
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:28,970
applied to this specification as well

574
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,860
okay uhm EPP is a provision extensible

575
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,210
provisioning protocol obviously

576
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:38,889
extensible because here we are extending

577
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:41,390
it and the extension means is about

578
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:44,780
sending financial information I mean

579
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:48,020
this customer has already paid so many

580
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,149
dollars and we've already provided so

581
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,970
much service so R is so their balance is

582
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:56,000
so many dollars and this was not in the

583
00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:01,430
base protocol in 57:31 and it's in the

584
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,190
extension so something has definitely

585
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,590
changed I mean the base protocol did not

586
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,290
have financial information the extension

587
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,709
does so you can't just say everything

588
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:16,280
that everything is already covered by

589
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:18,980
the previous specifications so yeah

590
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,930
please say I mean it could be okay it

591
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,320
could be okay to send to send the

592
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,210
balance over this protocol because it is

593
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,639
protected and it is going only to the

594
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:32,270
customer so tell you the customer their

595
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,620
own balance is fine I guess but you

596
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,210
should call it out this is new

597
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,429
information that it was not in the base

598
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,310
protocol it could be sensitive in

599
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:43,070
certain secret situations so you should

600
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:46,570
describe say that it's fine to send it

601
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:49,820
because of all those reasons but say it

602
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,280
another thing don't do both in one level

603
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,899
of indirection if I see well the

604
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,789
considerations for this is are the same

605
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,239
as in RFC that

606
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:01,158
go to RFC a and yeah the security

607
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:05,629
considerations there just say go to this

608
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,639
older RFC and at some point this is too

609
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:10,009
much so if you have more than one level

610
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:12,428
of indirection either go even either

611
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:15,710
reference the original document or just

612
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:18,159
write your considerations by yourself

613
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,690
even if you copy and pastes much of it

614
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,910
it at least makes you consider

615
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:26,499
everything okay another example

616
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,059
[Music]

617
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:31,009
procedures protocols extensions defined

618
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:33,109
in this document do not affect the bgp

619
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:36,739
security model see their security

620
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:39,799
considerations section of RFC 4742 71

621
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:45,139
that's BGP and a discussion of bgp

622
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:48,379
security in 42 72 and 69 52 for analysis

623
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:51,080
of security issues for BGP quick so

624
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:53,840
we're talking about an extension to BGP

625
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,590
that sends te that's traffic engineering

626
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,889
information over BGP but this is not all

627
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,689
that there isn't in the section the

628
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:04,609
other paragraph says the T of is

629
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,389
introduced in this document are used for

630
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:12,830
to propagate AGP defined information

631
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:14,149
same as in our c 78 10 and 7471 this TLB

632
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,059
represents the state and resource

633
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:18,889
availability of the IGP link their GP

634
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,479
instances originating these deities are

635
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:22,158
assumed to have all the required

636
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:25,249
security and authentication mechanisms

637
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,989
as described in those two documents in

638
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:28,159
order to prevent any security issue when

639
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:33,549
propagating tlvs

640
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:36,859
into bgp LS okay 78 10 and 7471

641
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:40,399
described sending these the same traffic

642
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:44,799
engineering information in ISAs and OSPF

643
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:48,559
respectively so these are two different

644
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,539
routing protocols and so the they

645
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,158
already had defined the traffic

646
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,690
engineering extension and now we're

647
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,789
taking the same traffic engineering

648
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:59,679
engineering extension and sending it

649
00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:02,419
over BGP so the of the security

650
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,149
considerations are the sum of BGP issues

651
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:09,210
and the traffic engineering in

652
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:12,179
ISAs and all OSPF issues is that a valid

653
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,860
claiming to make well I said it isn't

654
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:18,360
because it's not the same BGP is not the

655
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,429
same as ISAs and OSPF why because I

656
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,350
Esiason those bf run on corporate

657
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,900
networks usually I'm sure somebody can

658
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,939
say oh but I'm running BGP in between my

659
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,910
phone and my laptop but usually no

660
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,550
usually i Esiason OSPF run and corporate

661
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,920
networks and every node that is

662
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,970
participates in these protocols is owned

663
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,580
by the same entity

664
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,720
and while BGP runs on the internet it's

665
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,550
your router to somebody else's router so

666
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,830
it's not obvious to me that sending

667
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,620
traffic engineering information is okay

668
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,850
in BGP just because it's okay in OSPF

669
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,959
these are very different things so again

670
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,020
it could be fine

671
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,360
just say it say that these are traffic

672
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,450
engineering and we're not and sending

673
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,600
him over BGP to somebody else's router

674
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:09,600
does not make doesn't does not risk the

675
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,129
any attack that were aware of that's

676
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,830
fine you say that's but you have to say

677
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:20,040
this otherwise yeah you get to discuss

678
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:23,010
okay another thing we see a lot and the

679
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,170
first one here was actually the thing

680
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:29,010
that drove people to wrote to write 30

681
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:31,050
35 52 is we don't have to do security

682
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:34,220
because security is in some other layer

683
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:36,840
this comes up in as in just use IPSec

684
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,260
but that was very common in the past

685
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:44,760
just use TLS that's more common lately

686
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:47,390
or just use HTTP or IPSec with the I -

687
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,220
an SF extension that we're doing now and

688
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:52,710
soon to be published and just use TLS

689
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:58,350
with acne that's been published for half

690
00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:01,410
here ok so each of these requires a lot

691
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,810
of instruction to deploy can just a okay

692
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,070
use IPSec and everything is solved if

693
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,070
you want to tell people to use IPSec

694
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:11,850
great just tell them how if you want to

695
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,770
use TLS that's also great I mean the

696
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:16,490
word PKI it looks trivial to use but

697
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:20,070
that's only because some companies like

698
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:22,580
Google and Apple and Microsoft meet

699
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,490
often and do a lot of heavy lifting

700
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,840
to get it stored to work for you so if

701
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,880
people if you tell people to use a

702
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,570
security layer great but tell them how

703
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,000
and this is especially relevant for

704
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:37,159
authentication and credentials who gets

705
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,230
credentials how do you provide the

706
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,880
credentials how do you offend against

707
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,270
somebody coming to you to get the

708
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,660
credential and how do you validate the

709
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,820
certificate and another thing is

710
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,700
authorization who is authorized to do

711
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,050
what the common thing we see in

712
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,520
everybody who has a certificate is

713
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,570
trusted because otherwise they wouldn't

714
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,190
have a certificate we wouldn't have

715
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:00,679
given him a certificate if they weren't

716
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:04,430
trusted so again trusted by whom to do

717
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,290
what so we have this kind of flat

718
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,510
authorization model that anybody who has

719
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,250
a certificate is authorized to do

720
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:14,390
everything and authorized to impersonate

721
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:19,550
anyone else and no that's not a good

722
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:22,070
security model so we see and we see that

723
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:24,260
look so if you want to trust any

724
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,929
certificate holder in the corporate LDAP

725
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,480
environment and while doing this

726
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:32,870
protocol for internal networks and

727
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,890
everybody has a certificate from the

728
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,389
local Microsoft Active Directory well

729
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,850
every user every employee of that

730
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:45,020
organization has a certificate from that

731
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:48,409
l-dub every every machine has one and

732
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:51,290
that old printer next to the bathroom it

733
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,270
also has a certificate and if this is a

734
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,840
security model then that printer can do

735
00:33:53,270 --> 00:34:05,240
anything within your system that's

736
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:08,120
usually not a good idea okay there are

737
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:12,010
more specific pitfalls for young models

738
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:15,679
and there's a link there you are eyes

739
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:18,370
using them to locate resources there's a

740
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,610
section 7 in RFC 3986

741
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:27,880
time and replay is always the danger of

742
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:31,880
an attacker on path delaying packets or

743
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:34,880
recording Pakistan retransmitting them

744
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,500
broken constraints well attackers read

745
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,960
the RFC's but they're not bound by them

746
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:45,710
if you if we have this to bite field and

747
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,960
we have and the RFC says the number in

748
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,740
this to bite field must be lower than

749
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,270
500 this the attacker is not bound by

750
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:56,779
that they can send a much large number

751
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:58,580
they can send a string as long as they

752
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,750
want within the Jason I mean nobody

753
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:08,470
cares even if even be I've seen limits

754
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:12,260
the name to just 40 characters there's

755
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:16,040
some documents not usually in the ITF

756
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,480
saying it's this is okay for physical

757
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,520
security because we're using Bluetooth

758
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,690
and Bluetooth is only we only works for

759
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,240
ten ten meter distance but you can see

760
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:29,050
demonstrations of people with parabolic

761
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,700
dish and they're doing bluetooth with

762
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:36,770
from a distance of kilometer or two

763
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:38,779
kilometers just use more more power than

764
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,950
the Bluetooth document says that you're

765
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:44,900
allowed to another thing we like is

766
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,790
cryptographic agility I mean if you

767
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,170
write a document today and say well you

768
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:52,220
say es GCM because that's the that's the

769
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,890
algorithm that everybody likes

770
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,450
but then if four years down the line we

771
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,850
decide that we don't like it yes GCM

772
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,080
anymore for whatever reason are you

773
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,640
going to come back and write a new

774
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,850
document absolutely in the old one and

775
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,740
then are you going to go and replace all

776
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:10,730
the implementations that are deployed

777
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,379
already probably not so building

778
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:17,720
cryptographic agility into your probe

779
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:20,180
into your document if you are doing the

780
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,810
cryptography yourself first if you're

781
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,759
relying on TLS 1.3 then good just one

782
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,940
point three is going to do that for you

783
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,390
but in that case you want to have your

784
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:36,410
implementations able to update the TLS

785
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:38,150
version when necessary this is a link

786
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:41,149
actually if you download the slides and

787
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,360
there's much more there that's a link

788
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,920
maintained by the security IDs and it's

789
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,130
about

790
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,640
the stuff they often encounter that

791
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:53,950
makes them issue discusses so read that

792
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:59,279
and you may avoid having discusses on

793
00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:02,589
your documents so questions and before

794
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,570
you can go to questions please fill out

795
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:09,450
the survey because this is the first

796
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:09,450
time we're doing this presentation and

797
00:37:14,250 --> 00:38:23,290
so it would never catch this this

798
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,650
missing because I don't I didn't I

799
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:39,150
wouldn't know that all the libraries out

800
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:42,460
there support signatures okay yeah okay

801
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:45,970
so yeah but this is a good thing to call

802
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,970
out yes of course if some time if some

803
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:52,689
day all the all the libraries are better

804
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:54,459
than wait then you have no longer

805
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,140
relevant paragraph in the security

806
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,430
considerations that's not a bad thing

807
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,379
and calling it out

808
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:06,140
may lead your implementers to use a

809
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:08,680
library that that is better in advice

810
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:32,720
for implementers is always in scope for

811
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:36,620
any section in RFC well the big thing is

812
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:39,259
that your working group chair knows some

813
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,569
people know some security people very

814
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:46,460
least has access to the security ad and

815
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:48,980
can get someone to review the draft join

816
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:52,940
to join the mailing list look at this

817
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:55,450
we often get this request well this

818
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:58,790
working group there wants some input on

819
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:00,830
so-and-so draft who wants to join the

820
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,930
mailing list and look at this and this

821
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:05,569
is a common thing and it's done so

822
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,490
that's the first layer after that you

823
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:11,000
can ask for a secretary for an early

824
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:16,040
sector review and that usually gets you

825
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,200
an answer within a month or two and the

826
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,270
third thing yeah you'll get it in the

827
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,509
secretary view but that's kind of late

828
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:27,410
you want to do it in early secretary

829
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:30,050
review or get some assigned expert wait

830
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:34,299
and we'll do we'll do an early review

831
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:34,300
for no acknowledgement section

832
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:51,640
implementation and deployment

833
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,640
considerations yet with the attacks all

834
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,380
communication security based so could

835
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:11,960
you clarify that seeming gap to me

836
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,780
there's a Miss on operational security

837
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,490
or an cyber defense security

838
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,290
considerations and just perhaps should

839
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,868
this be called communication security

840
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:24,740
considerations or all those things in

841
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:30,290
scope but you just where are in scope

842
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:32,750
and my examples come from stuff the

843
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:36,380
thing you know documents that I've

844
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:40,070
reviewed and yeah well this is true for

845
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:43,390
for IAF documents in general and in the

846
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:46,339
security area perhaps a little more than

847
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:50,960
it's even more common that we kind of

848
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:53,900
ignore operational considerations and it

849
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,660
happens all too often and yeah but if

850
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:59,810
you have things that are important for

851
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:10,490
operation and deployment yeah they

852
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:12,320
really should go there I don't know how

853
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,000
many people it has to go through if

854
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,730
there's some requirement on the

855
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:23,119
diversity of technology or industry

856
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:25,280
background sure part of the publication

857
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,570
process after you click after they work

858
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,310
group chair clicks the submit to is G

859
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:35,030
button is that it goes to all the

860
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:36,680
directorates and we have this list of

861
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:38,390
people who are on the security

862
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,149
Directorate of the same goes for

863
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:46,270
transport and routing and applications

864
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:51,230
and we have I think 50 members or

865
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:54,589
somesuch and each document gets assigned

866
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:58,369
kind of round robin two and a reviewer

867
00:42:54,589 --> 00:43:01,580
and they write a review and it goes in a

868
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:05,180
mail to the is g2 the ITF mailing list

869
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:07,460
and to the document authors maybe also

870
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:10,310
to their group to the working group I'm

871
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:13,339
not sure about that but anyway this goes

872
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:17,359
to the document offers and that's a

873
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:20,650
review the area directors of obviously

874
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:24,259
know about it every document has this

875
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:28,070
every sorry secretary of view has this

876
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:31,790
boilerplate we have reviewed this as

877
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:34,730
part of the sector efforts to review all

878
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:38,089
documents the input the content of this

879
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:41,390
review are meant primarily as input for

880
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:44,570
the security area directors and others

881
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:58,960
should treat this as any other review in

882
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:58,960
90f last call is there

883
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:12,500
not automatically but there is this

884
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:14,450
process that use that we when we get the

885
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,369
list of documents that are going to be

886
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:20,180
assigned somebody can say oh I know

887
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:22,030
about this one and so I'd rather do my

888
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,259
review on this one rather than whatever

889
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,869
random document you're going to assign

890
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,730
me and another thing that could happen

891
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:32,390
is that I get assigned something and I

892
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:34,369
can't read yeah the terminology there

893
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,319
and saying I don't know anything about

894
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:37,760
this can somebody this is somebody as we

895
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,770
have our own meal and listen can

896
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,670
somebody else review this so owe you one

897
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:47,240
well it's not perfectly and then there's

898
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:50,330
there's a whole script that makes that

899
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,029
makes a for that make sure that we don't

900
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,930
do too many reviews so can somebody help

901
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,060
me with this and then if somebody

902
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,830
volunteers they can take the review off

903
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:21,740
of my hands and I'll get another one

904
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:24,560
next next round yes to 46 to s1 to 1.2

905
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:27,040
had a side channel was about a timing

906
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,040
side channel

907
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:46,569
well that was one of the reasons why we

908
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,309
wanted to revise it a few years ago yeah

909
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:52,579
there's a lot of things that we didn't

910
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:55,520
think about in 2003 and that we do think

911
00:45:52,579 --> 00:46:01,130
about today well privacy considerations

912
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,569
and pervasive monitoring that we we

913
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,859
didn't think there would be any reason

914
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:09,950
to you consider passive attacks because

915
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:12,170
we the single attacker can do can always

916
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,970
mount an active attack so why even

917
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:17,059
consider passive attacks and there's

918
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:19,399
some of that in the 3552 we just didn't

919
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:23,119
consider at the time that somebody would

920
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,980
be would have enough resources to do a

921
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,770
passive attack on the entire internet

922
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:58,750
and now it seems that they can almost do

923
00:46:27,770 --> 00:47:02,809
that where the ITF will we deal with

924
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:05,180
communications security mostly and so if

925
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:11,170
something requires choosing the the

926
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:15,500
exactly the exact right core within

927
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:16,430
within the host it's not really

928
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,410
something that has to do with

929
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:21,770
communication security same as that we

930
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,240
don't really discuss how to protect the

931
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,160
private key within the host so it

932
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,500
doesn't leak out mmm

933
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,690
these are

934
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:33,349
we don't do everything that has to do

935
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:35,119
with anything in computers so it's a

936
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:51,950
judgment call whether it is relevant for

937
00:47:35,119 --> 00:48:02,119
a particular and neither is shoulder

938
00:47:51,950 --> 00:48:07,960
surfing okay anything else no thank you

939
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:07,960
and please reply to the survey Thanks

940
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:33,140
can you go to the ether pad and put in

941
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:34,970
your name make it simpler and if

942
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:38,830
somebody wants to ask whether this falls

943
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,830
out under note will I have no idea
