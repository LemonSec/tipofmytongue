1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:10,020
all right it is five tends to only have

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,950
an hour slot let's get started welcome

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,980
David décor

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,910
I'm Jennifer mrs. Rachel

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,949
we have Magnus being jabber scribe so if

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,460
your remote either join the medical

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,910
queue if you want to speak to us using

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,550
the protocols we invented or have Magnus

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,109
relate if you want to do it be a

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,420
protocol some other ITF working group

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:38,220
admitted James James crusing is don't

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,290
take her back there he's doing in the

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,860
ether pads so if you want to look you

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,120
know also join and correct any typos he

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,360
has or anything like what I'm sure he'd

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,220
appreciate it

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,660
blue sheets are going around make sure

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:57,360
you sign them and we have a medical

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,679
remote participants so when you say

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,350
anything make sure to use the microphone

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,460
so that they can hear you and we can

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,110
have you on the recording so we can

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:10,710
figure out what you said later Nowell

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,740
Nowell applies make sure you understand

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,749
this if you're gonna say anything or

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,749
stay quiet if you don't understand it

27
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:25,850
somehow we got a bit of Chinese over

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:29,130
that but I don't think that's a big deal

29
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,798
okay so so now you can so under so you

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,689
can understand that well in Chinese also

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,289
alright so today I'm starting with this

32
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,969
agenda bash talking about various of our

33
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:42,179
working group documents that are not in

34
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:44,969
that are not the amount of specific

35
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:47,609
agenda items then we'll have 20 minutes

36
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,908
for Colin to talk about our MCAT CC

37
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:52,619
feedback draft and then we'll be handing

38
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,630
over to Ronnie to talk about the status

39
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,149
of the payload working group which is

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,439
our close sibling working group and then

41
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,740
we'll finish with anything else anybody

42
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,469
wants to talk about anybody have any

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,630
comments on that agenda it's a fairly

44
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,108
standard agenda we just copy and pasted

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,109
from session to session

46
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:20,510
what's up a OCB okay so he gives me this

47
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,790
okay telling that something cuz I feel

48
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,590
like it feels okay cool

49
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,950
working group documents a number of

50
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,090
things are still in cluster 238 which

51
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,410
allegedly will be clear real soon now

52
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,040
I'm sure that we very exciting

53
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:39,560
especially if you're the RFC editor and

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:47,149
frame art and lrr so awaiting on frame

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:48,560
working so first item is multiplex

56
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,530
guidelines which I think Magnus said he

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:03:00,739
has enough to talk about so you want to

58
00:02:51,530 --> 00:03:04,640
talk instead that's so - yes we finally

59
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:07,340
updated the update the comments not

60
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,630
quite done now you submitted the drafts

61
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,140
and people could review what we talked

62
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:15,200
so far they're still I would wish that

63
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,559
somebody looks and I think includes some

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,420
of my co-authors to look at these

65
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,790
questions of mailing lists and then was

66
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:30,619
about to say okay if they have anything

67
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:32,510
was safe about those so hey questions

68
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,989
does a co-worker who has a close with

69
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:39,048
the draft referral services it looks at

70
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,209
the questions in the mailing list animal

71
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,850
toy what changed in the draft and I

72
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,290
didn't really have anything that the

73
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:56,888
draft seem like a reasonable response to

74
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:56,888
the questions I live it to serve

75
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:14,250
all right so then frame marking you talk

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,800
you know how long this has been around

77
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,720
it's a Navy TX draft which was a working

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,270
group that hasn't existed in several

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,890
years now that MOCA meeting said they

80
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:30,630
know so we thought we were going to go

81
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:33,719
do a pub wreck on it after the last IETF

82
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,060
and then a bunch of more comments were

83
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,880
submitted on the draft which I asked the

84
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,880
authors to respond to which they did not

85
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,950
so I spoke to the author yesterday and

86
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,990
he swore to me that he would respond to

87
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,570
it

88
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:56,310
I'm not but I will probably need to nag

89
00:04:51,570 --> 00:05:00,030
him a few more times but hopefully we'll

90
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:05,280
be able to clear those up relatively

91
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,260
quickly if smoke smell comes in we will

92
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,179
try to get him to commit to that at a

93
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:18,000
microphone but maybe he's smarter than

94
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:20,610
that and not bothering the event and

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,780
then people if CC feedback is the main

96
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,780
agenda item today that's it okay ah

97
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,990
there he is moe perfect timing you

98
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,190
thought maybe or you're going you you

99
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:44,390
thought you could wait until after we

100
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,390
were switching so yes so frame marking

101
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:55,290
and it still had some comments that I

102
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,930
think needs minutes all of them a lot of

103
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,640
the comments I think we can clarify and

104
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:04,920
explain but there's going to be a few

105
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,599
that the draft clarify texture again

106
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,440
when do you think you could have that

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,500
clarified by the end of this week okay

108
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,660
okay so at that point do we think it's

109
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,620
ready for

110
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:22,460
pop rock or do we need to the authors do

111
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:25,190
have much feedback to the sites okay I

112
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,780
mean basically I consider that to be

113
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,590
part of working with blast calls so I

114
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,809
think I don't think there's anything

115
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,890
that would require a second work last

116
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,870
call or anything as far as I know

117
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:40,039
there's been no major technical changes

118
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,420
right it's kind of supposed to just

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,470
clarifying text okay

120
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,740
the only thing would have been a major

121
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,810
technical changes uh so one of those

122
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,970
comments this is around getting guidance

123
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,950
about how to use these things I thought

124
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,260
we decided as a hooker earlier that this

125
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,150
will provide guidance it wouldn't be

126
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,909
normative and how a message you should

127
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,460
operate - gives the tools and it's up to

128
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,140
implementers to decide because there's

129
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,900
so many different implementation options

130
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:11,919
press use well I think it's the first to

131
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:19,940
get guidance about to do certain things

132
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:21,770
all right the question has arisen as to

133
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:29,150
which scalability votes this is

134
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:30,349
compatible with yes the when you say

135
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,390
scale blending modes I think you mean

136
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:36,920
the restriction that it only works for

137
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,840
nested several layers right like yeah in

138
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,730
particular I know what I'm thinking

139
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,700
about is like if I look at all the weird

140
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,530
scalability both the maybe one surely

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,560
there's some set of those it would not

142
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,270
work with and well as I'm sure you're

143
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,830
aware Bernard anyone doesn't plan to

144
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,570
bring to peel a draft to this working

145
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:57,919
group and does nothing to use the free

146
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:02,300
marketing draft at all marquee use

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:06,610
custom it the weird thing is that the

148
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,610
Weber IPC cover facial spray marquee

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,960
unless it's ripped out so anyway in that

150
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,550
in that in in trying to figure out that

151
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,979
question how you would implement free

152
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,700
marketing with everyone that question

153
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:27,639
has come up yes I agree it's an issue

154
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,110
but I don't think it's an issue that

155
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,979
that this draft can solve I think it's a

156
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:36,669
larger issue that the media would have

157
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:40,709
to bring that into work at diets you

158
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,708
have to be able to do something about it

159
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,680
don't go away

160
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,910
I heard you heard it I heard that this

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:09:01,769
is not going to be in a book because

162
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:01,769
Carla asked me about it's complicated

163
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:10,360
there's no no one has been working

164
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,209
towards a public draft in the ITF on

165
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:22,390
anyone yet my knowledge she was working

166
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:30,609
on it so don't say you guys some some

167
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:33,000
guys decided not that's that's an open

168
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,800
question too about whether how would you

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,480
register Omega and I know registration

170
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,519
disaster yeah what I'll stay though is

171
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,300
the same question that arise for benign

172
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:49,570
and then because they are now supported

173
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,729
in vp9 so even if we keep baby one out

174
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,800
of scope there's still a question about

175
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,940
the implications of negotiating it for

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,849
vp9 I mean most periods already

177
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:04,060
supported non temporally nested temporal

178
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,040
layers so I think they're just the the

179
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,839
thing in what frame marking says is if

180
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,149
you're encoding in a way that's not

181
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,589
compatible with this spec dump what

182
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:16,810
frame markings on it so the real

183
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:19,149
restriction is that in order to be able

184
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,599
to understand what's coming in the

185
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:25,269
stream and SS you would need a lot more

186
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,670
a lot more elaborate information than

187
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:30,910
the frame marking provides maybe even

188
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,910
more that could reasonably be signaled

189
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,160
if the scale data structures are

190
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,750
unconstrained it would it would you

191
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,839
basically have to have a full dependency

192
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,320
tree

193
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,870
all of the prior frame until debris the

194
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,720
last night which is unreasonable to say

195
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:52,810
so without constraining scalability

196
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,120
format without having some fixed

197
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:59,630
scalability layer information it becomes

198
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,370
very difficult to have so I mean I feel

199
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,470
like we just remarking just needs to say

200
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,050
is this is not capable of expressing

201
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,970
every scalability mode that the codecs

202
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,540
support

203
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,710
therefore if you're if you're encoding a

204
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,360
mode that this doesn't support you must

205
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,640
not put trademarking on it then maybe

206
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:22,700
that's so you might already say that but

207
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,260
we burn our doors is that okay is that

208
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,740
is that too much of a constraint for

209
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,529
real implementations well no I I'm not

210
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:34,850
asking that question

211
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:36,620
because I'm just asking if you can make

212
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,360
enough of a statement in the document so

213
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,480
it at least it's clear what modes would

214
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,430
be supported or not we can figure out

215
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,070
what the implications of that are there

216
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,839
probably lots of situations where the

217
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,370
supported modes will be sufficient for a

218
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,410
particular application and then they can

219
00:11:49,370 --> 00:12:04,220
turn on frame marking and you know use

220
00:11:51,410 --> 00:12:05,839
it to the hours contact yeah all right

221
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:15,230
so I think that's it for frame marking

222
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:20,480
and let's get to CCC feedback did you

223
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:22,810
have the no no they didn't do that all

224
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,810
right so

225
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:42,929
Tuesday yes Tuesday afternoon three

226
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:46,978
there you can yeah I think so but we

227
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:51,119
didn't hold on see who are you that

228
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:53,459
there we are will that work what we can

229
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:54,689
work is amazing all right I'm glad to

230
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,978
see we have a working good chair who

231
00:12:54,689 --> 00:13:00,238
knows how to work the Chromebooks

232
00:12:55,979 --> 00:13:02,279
because I certainly don't ok so hi I'm

233
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:06,059
Connor can't talk about the RTP

234
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:08,970
congestion control - feedback draft this

235
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:12,419
is a draft that is joint work with ahead

236
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,729
and Varun and Micah Romero some of these

237
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,259
slides and I think most of the changes

238
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:20,309
this time are all my fault though so

239
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:23,579
blame me for all the mistakes okay so

240
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:27,089
this was discussed last meeting there

241
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:28,949
was a bunch of people Jonathan and I

242
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,079
forget who else three or four of us were

243
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,729
playing at the hackathon in Prague give

244
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,189
a bunch of really nice feedback on this

245
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,350
draft we had some discussion of the last

246
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:40,858
meeting about what to do about that

247
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:44,160
and I've submitted the zero for Russian

248
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:45,329
attitude to reflect that experience you

249
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,629
will be pleased to know there are no

250
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:49,498
changes whatsoever to the packet formats

251
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:54,689
we've done it's made a bunch of

252
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:55,850
clarifications to the text ok so what

253
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:59,969
have we changed

254
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:03,989
we have added an example of how to use

255
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:06,299
the rtcp feedback attribute on the basis

256
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:09,149
that both myself end up is one of the

257
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,319
implements has got it wrong when when I

258
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,269
was writing the draft and when it was

259
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,858
being implemented hopefully what is on

260
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,489
the slide is now correct and if you're

261
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:19,289
on a Greece that's right way of doing it

262
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:20,819
but there's no us on example in there so

263
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:23,309
hopefully people keep agreeing that this

264
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:25,169
is the right way of doing it

265
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:28,259
we've added a clarification that if

266
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:30,809
you've negotiated if you see or

267
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,749
retransmission then you should send a

268
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,290
congestion control feedback for the fake

269
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,899
packets

270
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,219
for the retransmission packets since

271
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,959
this it's all things which are being

272
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,790
being transmitted and contributing to

273
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:46,290
congestion so you should send feedback

274
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:49,529
on itself we clarified that when you're

275
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,160
using the STP bundle extension the

276
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:55,199
congestion control feedback signaling

277
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:00,089
matches the rest of the ACK feedback for

278
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,959
a TCP F the rtcp AFB attribute which is

279
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:08,310
s which is identical per payload type

280
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:11,399
according to the draft STP but MUX

281
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:15,000
attributes it's fine entirely clear what

282
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:17,190
identical payload type means night-time

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,449
it clear to me what identical payload

284
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,190
type means when you have a wild-card

285
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:22,380
payload type but that's something we

286
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,810
should clarify I guess in STP MUX

287
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,149
attributes and they did send email to

288
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,930
their music list about that but no one

289
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:34,800
replied on that but they were a music

290
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,209
worried about that and we're putting we

291
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,130
have a long discussion of the last

292
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,800
meeting about what should happen if

293
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,149
these the off the SDP offer includes

294
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,430
several different ways of providing

295
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,779
congestion control feedback and the

296
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,579
drafter now says the receiver should

297
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,350
pick its preferred mechanism and use

298
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,579
that consistently and so if you get a

299
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:57,329
rien vite you should where possible

300
00:15:52,579 --> 00:16:00,180
reply with the same mechanism in terms

301
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,790
of the actual a TCP congestion control

302
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,870
feedback again we didn't change the

303
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:10,709
feedback at all we put in some

304
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:13,019
clarifications in particular we we put

305
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,790
in some text that says if you send

306
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,279
feedback which indicates that some

307
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,769
packets are lost that is not an explicit

308
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,689
request that you retransmit that the

309
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,519
sender retransmit those lost packets

310
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,139
it's just an indication that those

311
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,350
packets were lost on this is affecting

312
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:31,500
the the state of the congestion so this

313
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,389
doesn't act as an explicit neck if you

314
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,540
want if you want so next you should send

315
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:38,189
max in the same way equally it doesn't

316
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,529
prohibit the sender from retransmitting

317
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:42,209
those lost packets if it says negotiated

318
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:45,089
a retransmission packet from that but it

319
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,709
doesn't explicitly require it so as

320
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,940
usual a sender what if you have

321
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,010
retransmission enabled

322
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,850
couldn't choose to retransmit any or all

323
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:57,330
of the packets it feels like and we put

324
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,420
in a clarification that if you configure

325
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,280
your are TCP bandwidth fraction Wiggly

326
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,200
you may end up having to generate some

327
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,300
very large congestion can draw a

328
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,280
feedback packets in which case you may

329
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,740
have to split it across multiple our TCP

330
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,450
/ rtcp packets because it won't fit in

331
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:17,640
the MTU my advice that is don't do that

332
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,140
configure your a TCP bandwidth fraction

333
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,060
so you put in enough rack in enough

334
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,740
feedback band which the seminary costs

335
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,780
more often and it won't be an issue yeah

336
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,100
I think the section this came up with in

337
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,960
the hackathon because we you know one

338
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,419
side wasn't sending feedback at all so

339
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,890
that the other side was ramping up so

340
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,780
still basically one side was

341
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,000
successfully ramping up to several

342
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,040
megabits the other side was still stuck

343
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,470
at whatever it's the minimum its minimum

344
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,420
starting rate was so it basically was

345
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,830
making its artistic came back bandwidth

346
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,360
its practice media bandwidth which was

347
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,300
still stuck at 50 kilobits or something

348
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,310
so yeah yeah yes so if you do something

349
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,780
dumb with the amount of feedback you're

350
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,159
allowed to send then you will have to

351
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,260
generate large packets and it will go

352
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,030
wrong don't do that we added a section

353
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,710
on congestion response when the

354
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,610
congestion control feedback packets are

355
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,130
lost now what this says the important

356
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,620
bit is it says that like all our TCP pay

357
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,630
packets the congestion control feedback

358
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,399
packets are unreliable and might be lost

359
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,930
therefore if you're designing a

360
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,540
congestion control algorithm you must

361
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:24,540
specify how that algorithm response to

362
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,970
loss of feedback packets and we then

363
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,040
added some advice which says well if you

364
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,360
just lose one feedback packet you should

365
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,670
probably assume that things haven't

366
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,139
changed significantly and carry on at

367
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,570
about the same rate you are you are

368
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,580
sending before if you keep losing

369
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,409
feedback packets you go for a long time

370
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,389
when you're not getting congestion

371
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,280
control feedback this is probably an

372
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,320
indication that that either the forward

373
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,180
or the reverse path has failed and you

374
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,330
should be fairly aggressively ramping

375
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,890
down your sending rate and the circuit

376
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,090
breaker has some guidance there which

377
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,889
suggests you should stop sending after

378
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,629
I forget how many but after some number

379
00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:01,330
of error reporting intervals without

380
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:02,408
getting any feedback the main thing

381
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,149
though is that the congestion control

382
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,039
algorithm should specify what it should

383
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:11,979
do and that should be to to ramp down

384
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:14,549
fairly aggressively so that's it I have

385
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,860
new technical open issues with the draft

386
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:20,799
of non technical issues which is still

387
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,918
to do are to add a comparison with the

388
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,860
Google draft and explain the design

389
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,529
rationale and various trade off various

390
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,869
design trade-offs of the two approaches

391
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:34,240
and so I have some discussion on how you

392
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:36,519
convert between the per SSRC sequence

393
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,980
numbers which this uses and unified

394
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,320
sequence numbers which the whole my

395
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,519
draft users just just as part of the

396
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,320
discussion that was the different

397
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:48,730
trade-offs there so I hope that we will

398
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,539
have that already for working group last

399
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,769
call long before the Singapore meeting

400
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:56,580
so we've been here before but hopefully

401
00:19:53,769 --> 00:20:03,669
we're really getting there this time

402
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:06,039
money so just a question or Anya I think

403
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,259
it's a question is this a different

404
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,499
behavior than if I suddenly stopped

405
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:15,940
receiving our DCP messages if I don't

406
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:20,700
receive any congestion control so if you

407
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,700
stop receiving our TCP recent surveys

408
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,700
you know most of the issue that the

409
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:31,720
congestion control people like it's

410
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,049
almost okay yes but that means that is

411
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:38,049
it different behavior from the receiver

412
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:41,529
of the RCP feedback that feedback then

413
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:46,269
if he doesn't receive other rtcp

414
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:49,059
messages I mean this this draft is about

415
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:52,419
congestion control so that's why do you

416
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:57,460
doing here not taking something it was

417
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:59,799
the normal behavior in these days so RFC

418
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:05,379
3550 doesn't say anything about what

419
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:06,980
happens if rtcp packets stop I think

420
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:10,850
that was really the circuit

421
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,800
a draft has some generic guidance this

422
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,330
draft is specifically about congestion

423
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,629
control so it gives some specific

424
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,800
guidance relating to congestion control

425
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,990
but you know I mean I think it's

426
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,970
generally good practice that if you know

427
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,620
if you're sending packets and the

428
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,150
feedback stops it's probably a sign that

429
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,949
something is broken and you should you

430
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,390
should stop sending very in the very

431
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,120
weird circumstance and if you stop

432
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,390
getting any CC FPS but get all other

433
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:39,639
rtcp probably somebody's watching you

434
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,640
attack on you usually weird metal books

435
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:54,320
okay anything else so so you expect to

436
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:58,040
have that draft out sometimes over the

437
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,899
summer yeah before your run yeah before

438
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:12,440
the students get back is my plan and

439
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:15,440
Ronnie how do you wanna handle this and

440
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,990
yeah anybody not get a blue sheet Justin

441
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,610
you came in late in oh yeah sorry I

442
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,360
don't mean to pick on you well came in

443
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:25,760
late to one another Stellar's - there's

444
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,000
two going around so there's one the

445
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,230
other ones up here so Justin that's the

446
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,050
only one that's convenient does anybody

447
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:45,290
right now I think Colin was raising his

448
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:47,300
hand for blue sheet and okay as as in

449
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,000
the last meeting we are just trying to

450
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:53,530
provide to take this opportunity and

451
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,330
provide just the information the status

452
00:22:53,530 --> 00:23:01,160
the status of the payload working group

453
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,860
the presentation was done by me and by

454
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:08,540
Ali my culture who's not here at the

455
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:12,909
meeting next slide so since the last

456
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:16,980
meeting we have RFC 86 27 which is the

457
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:20,460
flexible faq published which was

458
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,040
needed by the RTC web and we are happy

459
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:28,350
to have it already did that thank you

460
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:34,340
more there's draft does the t's this vc

461
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:37,709
is tailored to publication on february

462
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:40,050
and the ad change will Mar so we are

463
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,960
hoping that we will start were looking

464
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:46,620
at did this one because there's no other

465
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,550
thing next night so the world of

466
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,870
documents there's the Tetra the tetra

467
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,120
payload that was ready

468
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:56,340
this one was strange because it was

469
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,520
registered the the payload would

470
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:02,820
register by group from Etsy in the

471
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,629
middle of our development cycle the auto

472
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:09,870
claims on May 19 that they made this

473
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:12,360
year that they want to proceed but they

474
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,310
never did any update on the document so

475
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:20,219
I need to ask it again because it's

476
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:22,020
expiring the JPEG xx XS there were

477
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,580
comments on the list and the author will

478
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,629
submit the new revision bed with the

479
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:32,790
conclusion that was last last messages

480
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:34,920
were from last month's the 50 ml this

481
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,700
one the media subtype was registered by

482
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:42,690
w3c and this document specified the RTP

483
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:45,660
payload 48 ml we had a working class

484
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,690
call which ended of July 18 but there

485
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:51,840
were no reviews in the past before that

486
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,930
well he w3c reviewed the document before

487
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,970
the one who press call and and they were

488
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,860
ok with the textile acident again at

489
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,290
least to send a message saying that

490
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,810
that's ok for them to to continue if

491
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:06,990
anyone would like to review if it would

492
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:12,679
be helpful the only one the only one

493
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,680
document that still open vp9

494
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:20,100
some speaking as an author that I meant

495
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,950
to so I mentally do a refresh of the

496
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,990
document after the last one but I didn't

497
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,390
so but I did talk to Justin earlier this

498
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,010
week and basically he asked me to turn

499
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,040
the various two dudes in the document

500
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,830
into actually open issues

501
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,830
the github repo which I have done and he

502
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:37,360
says he'll find he'll convince the other

503
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,280
co-authors who I believe worked for him

504
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,110
to do something like that

505
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,510
the one as I was doing that I realize

506
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:47,530
there was one actual technical open

507
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:49,810
issue which is that the way we have SLI

508
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:53,170
defined doesn't actually work with a

509
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:55,570
special scalability it may be that

510
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,340
nobody cares about SLI I believe that

511
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,350
it's not it widely believed was

512
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,649
implemented in WebRTC stacks for

513
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:06,070
instance so the answer might be to say

514
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:08,500
not supported I don't know if anybody

515
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,780
has any if nobody cares about SLI that's

516
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,120
probably the easiest thing to do because

517
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,010
it's all obviously it's a lot easier to

518
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,389
add it later if somebody says although I

519
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:20,410
needed after all than to try to fix a

520
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,530
broken definition

521
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:36,640
does anybody have any opinions anybody

522
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:45,790
ever use SLI throw it out yeah okay yeah

523
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:48,460
it sounds okay so on throwing out SLI

524
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,110
and you know I think I believe they've

525
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,670
it up there's another minor change to

526
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,389
the draft which one of my co-authors

527
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:58,240
check into github but which I saw like a

528
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:02,100
nerve that this week the other ones it

529
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:07,390
depends on how quickly justin can look

530
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:09,969
the other Walters Justin you ready

531
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:12,130
Google I think if you folks on vacation

532
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,240
right now we're co-authors but I think

533
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:18,460
that right time frame would be before

534
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,540
106 okay I think before 106 yes we all

535
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,400
want get the saga bytes

536
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,170
yeah all right and given that it's been

537
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,000
shipping in chrome for like three years

538
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:29,230
now we probably ought to have a special

539
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,080
for it okay is there an official so we

540
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,550
could have repo for a VP for

541
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,230
organization no this would be payload

542
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,210
but I don't think we don't have one yet

543
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,190
now so I can stay in there as an author

544
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,200
because everyone is doing their own

545
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,970
stuff I mean it's like every document

546
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,360
comes from a different group of people I

547
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,950
mean it's not like

548
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,240
there's some regular people who were

549
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,220
here in pain oh do you know you come

550
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,700
into the payment then you go away from

551
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:56,000
from that okay that just to say that

552
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,940
there are no any there no no individual

553
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,980
graph that waiting to become four new

554
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,289
payloads so this is the all the work

555
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,289
that we currently have at the moment

556
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,779
any questions comments

557
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,409
okay if not when we managed to finish in

558
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:15,169
half an hour

559
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:19,419
so go us accepted I think by believe

560
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,419
that car Colin had some other business

561
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:38,779
I'm sure many of this group was

562
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:42,320
originally chaired by Steve Kozma and

563
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:44,899
the group was founded if I have check my

564
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,860
words correctly over between second IETF

565
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:52,899
sense of faith in 1891 and Steve steps

566
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:57,979
down in 1857 back in 2003

567
00:28:52,899 --> 00:29:01,039
Magnus delivers yes you would be pleased

568
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,139
to hear that it has not any fewer who

569
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,179

00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,940
multimedia informative contributions of

575
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:18,340
