hop-by-hop option and then we have two

29
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:31,720

prep 64 and router advertisements so we

36
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,659
for today's agenda we made this may end

37
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:01,400
up going quicker so we may move some of

38
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,138
the other talks up but we'll see how it

39
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,790
goes

40
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:11,780
and then we have ron's oh no we have a

41
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:15,650

42
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,709
to historic and though he bronze sr v6 +

43
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,978
draft and we've asked him to basically

44
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,560
just not get into the details but talk

45
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:27,800
about overview and motivation and then

46
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:33,199
we have a whole bunch of short talks

47
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:36,080
that were new work and you know most of

48
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,710
them are spring related that we're going

49
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:46,039
to try to get to both today and Thursday

50
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:48,979
if we have time we'll movies so right

51
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:52,699
and for the document status since the

52
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:54,830
last IDF in Prague no published are sees

53
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,889
nothing in the RFC editor

54
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,770
cue yet but we managed to get DSR hbase

55
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:05,060
document to the IES G which is on the

56
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:09,710
session coming up just after this and we

57
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,500
have after much deliberation in there

58
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:18,049
are parking near each advertisement ipv6

59
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,060
only flag your a common chain yeah just

60
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,039
want to say is it this is really

61
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,599
disappointing because now I'm totally

62
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,990
confused how we are going to

63
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,759
incrementally deploy v6 on the networks

64
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,789
so I suggest people might who were

65
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,039
against it might think about the

66
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:36,500
possible deployment model because now

67
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,210
when we decided that we don't do not

68
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,039
want to have explicit signal in the

69
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,599
network we might end up with some

70
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,409
implicit signal and which is probably

71
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:48,349
not a good idea right and as I said on

72
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:52,940
the mailing list I found this call to be

73
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:53,420
difficult to make you know oh well our

74
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,250
age

75
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,440
I was going to say that you know come

76
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,560
and talk to me and the ad the ad is at

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,550
the microphone so Suresh please yeah a

78
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,590
solution

79
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,640
so like Ola and I talked quite a bit

80
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,109
about this like so there's no consensus

81
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,340
to advance this doesn't mean it's a bad

82
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,630
Eddy or anything right so it's just that

83
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,679
this like set of compromises to be made

84
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,150
because it's like quite a bit of

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,160
operator feedback saying this is like

86
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,229
actively harmful to them right and

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,490
there's like this poster points a

88
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,110
negative points it's just that we

89
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,420
couldn't find consensus to advance but

90
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,190
if like maybe a year from now things

91
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,840
changes like you know we could bring

92
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,090
this back and talk about it right or

93
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,789
something materially changes that'll

94
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,400
change people's minds on this like III

95
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,560
know you're disappointed Jen but like

96
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,310
it's the only read of the consensus like

97
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,380
Ola and I could do on this and of course

98
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,830
you can appeal this decision right and

99
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,020
there's a process of that but you know

100
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,729
yes it was certainly hard and I'm not

101
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,549
I'm not happy with the outcome either

102
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:58,640
but that was you know where it seemed

103
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,090
like the community wanted to go okay

104
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,729
thank you thanks for it document status

105
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,739
- we have three working group documents

106
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,230
we have the ICMP errors it's on the

107
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,190
agenda for today we have the privacy

108
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:15,410
extension after date that's in review I

109
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,080
think we have two reviews and we heard

110
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,210
from one so I'll follow up that this

111
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,229
week and post an update on the mailing

112
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,479
list and then we have the discovering

113
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,520
statics - or not 64 prefixes in ruther

114
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:34,790
advertisements which is either on by the

115
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:37,580
end of today or for Thursday we have two

116
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,340
ongoing reviews from other working

117
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,250
groups the IP way one I think we're

118
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,969
pretty much done with that's going on in

119
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:49,040
IP wave there's been quite a lot of back

120
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,740
and forth on that one with regards to

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,210
prefix lengths and so on and from 6lo

122
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,270
which we just received the our v6

123
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:59,630
backbone reader document for a review

124
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:04,010
team winters have graciously accepted

125
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:06,140
with a little bit of nudging I accepted

126
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,010
to review that if there's anyone else

127
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,930
who

128
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,760
like to review that document please

129
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,240
raise your hand or or let the chairs

130
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:17,240
know it's recently urgently so we'd like

131
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:23,240
to have a review it in in you know a

132
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:27,110
week or two for that one okay so the

133
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,350
next topic is any comments on the SRH

134
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,169
based document there are no slides on

135
00:08:30,350 --> 00:09:04,400
that badarian will bring up the the

136
00:08:33,169 --> 00:09:06,920
email from our beloved ad okay good

137
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,050
morning afternoon evening it's evening I

138
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:14,060
wasn't ok here we go

139
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:16,640
all right so last IETF we completed our

140
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,339
last call we've gone to review now

141
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:24,500
suresh last week at the end of the week

142
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:28,790
had come up with with his review

143
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:32,270
comments and we've gone over those I'm

144
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,860
still getting them completed so what

145
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:37,760
we're gonna do is just talk about the

146
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:41,030
issues that Suresh rose rate risen had

147
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,550
had brought forward like that's right

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:47,630
word and how we're gonna resolve those

149
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,750
and at the end of that if anyone has

150
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,730
comments you're welcome to come on all

151
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,290
right the first one and I'm gonna read

152
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,610
from down here so TL views are present

153
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,500
when the header extinction links exceeds

154
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,750
the last entry element in the segment's

155
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,580
list and suresh points out this doesn't

156
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,080
doesn't sound right

157
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,330
i think we can fix this with a bit of

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,780
math describing exactly how an

159
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,070
implementation would be able to identify

160
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,410
when TLV czar presents

161
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,490
so i'll add that in and that'll go to

162
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,750
the list section 2.1 what's the purpose

163
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,510
of being able to include an HTML

164
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:26,450
TLV with the key idea set to zero since

165
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,670
there'll be no H Mac that's been in the

166
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,220
draft for quite some time and I'm gonna

167
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,199
leave that as to be determined because I

168
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:38,690
have to go back and see what the

169
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,670
original intent was around that section

170
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,440
- one two - where the SRH

171
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,959
implementations can support multiple

172
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:50,300
hash functions but must implement sha

173
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,460
- in the sha-256 variant the belief was

174
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,069
that that must level requirement was was

175
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,620
a little too much and there's an easy

176
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,690
fix here to just qualify that text to

177
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,740
say that well implementations that do

178
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:11,590
support the hvac must support this chef

179
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:14,930
256 pasted some old text in here for

180
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:18,410
section 5.3 where there's an ask for

181
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,469
more descriptive more descriptive text

182
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,000
around the MTU considerations and I

183
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,580
think what really needs to go in here is

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,710
just simply stating that the SR source

185
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:34,370
node encapsulate s' in a pack of this

186
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:38,750
traversing an SR domain and because of

187
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:41,950
that encapsulation the edges of the SR

188
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,000
domain need to consider MTU and that

189
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:50,810
text will be sent out to the list

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,390
something along those lines now these

191
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,459
are our our minor comments here most of

192
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:59,060
these suresh has provided text for so

193
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:02,270
these are go relatively quickly there's

194
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,219
a comment here saying that RFC 82,000

195
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,839
doesn't actually talk about mutability

196
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,260
and and we did talk about this within

197
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,500
the working group quite a bit I think

198
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,630
the fix here is going to be mentioning

199
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,660
that well RFC d200 doesn't explicitly

200
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:22,040
state anything about mutability that it

201
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:24,800
does allude to it in section 4.4 and I

202
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,750
think that'll be our resolution - to

203
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,579
this particular question I know we had a

204
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,250
lot of comment around this text and a

205
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,830
lot of work on it in the working group

206
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,440
go ahead stressed yet a decision so like

207
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,600
my suggested way of going forward with

208
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,269
this was saying that based on the

209
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,720
constraints specified in Section 404 of

210
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:47,600
8200 like no insertion da da da right

211
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,980
these fields are immutable so that that

212
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,380
means that people are not looking for

213
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,630
the mutability takes us right hundred

214
00:12:51,380 --> 00:13:03,920
and that's that should be a good thing

215
00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:11,810
right okay

216
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:13,430
these offer tubes cancel this here in

217
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,050
section two one

218
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,120
I think we should also mention that

219
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,130
padding tlvs are used for alignment of

220
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,500
tlvs themselves something along lines of

221
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,439
the new text that was provided this

222
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,240
looks this looks okay to me and that's

223
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,260
obviously the intention of like padding

224
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,600
TLV uses two is to align the tlvs so

225
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:36,649
that should be good to go section two

226
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,140
one two one was this one text in the

227
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,230
beginning is real okay this is this is

228
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:46,880
in reference to text in the HVAC HVAC

229
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:50,930
field and i don't have the final text

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,430
for this yet but some some new text some

231
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,649
I shouldn't say text because i'm

232
00:13:52,430 --> 00:14:01,060
overusing that word now a new sentence

233
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:03,350
describing that no describing this

234
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,349
alternate composition without using the

235
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:12,410
word text is what we'll use to to fix

236
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:15,890
this particular issue section five point

237
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:19,550
for the zero a segment doesn't seem very

238
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:22,819
obvious some new text is is suggested

239
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:26,599
here so we'll just take that new that

240
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:30,370
new text as is and then on the editorial

241
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,300
section he's got some suggestions around

242
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,220
segment routing could be applied to the

243
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,000
v6 data plane using a new type of

244
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,529
routing extension header he's got to fix

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,529
up there and that text looks fine

246
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:49,470
and another fix up in the in the last

247
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,720
comment here as well just some

248
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,910
reordering there and I don't say

249
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,810
anything wrong with that either looks

250
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,850
pretty straightforward so once once I

251
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,910
get the alterations done we'll send them

252
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,950
out to the list and then released a new

253
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,310
version of the draft

254
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:10,020
thanks ration so likes it send your

255
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,760
fixes to the list and publish a new

256
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,550
version and I'll send it off to Ikea

257
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,500
last call and then just follow the

258
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,349
process afterwards like you know look at

259
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,660
the directorate's and isg and hopefully

260
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,720
we'll get this done quickly yes it's

261
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:38,280
definitely cool nice night

262
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:40,430
right thanks so tom herpich i think you

263
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,430
are

264
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,729
[Music]

265
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,010
[Music]

266
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:50,089
see the chair savvy enthusiasm is

267
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:50,089
limited to powering things back a finale

268
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:11,929
if if me deco is listening could you

269
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:11,929
send the a/v people please

270
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:55,879
I'm sure there's a v6 or beige pocket no

271
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:57,559
quite events figures that we use the and

272
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,620
I want and when you plug it back in

273
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:04,178
again it doesn't get her way nice free

274
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,178
so we try to win between the mi

275
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:31,960
okay so I haven't disappear as well oh

276
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:55,940
it's not that

277
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:58,940
no it's like a network problem you just

278
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:02,009
stop poking the no crease lines

279
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,009
[Music]

280
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,719
[Music]

281
00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:04,269
yeah who just go with this one so you

282
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:27,580
transfer this it should work over here

283
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:28,509
as well okay thank you okay so there

284
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,059
must be a good joke in there somewhere

285
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:33,759
but kind of late in the day so I won't

286
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,970
even try so I'm going to talk a little

287
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,580
bit hopefully this will be brief about

288
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:43,570
icmpv6 errors for discarding packets

289
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,889
this is a working group draft a little

290
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:49,990
just a little bit of overview so the

291
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:52,689
idea is that we want some ICMP errors

292
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:56,470
that host in middle boxes can send when

293
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:58,570
they drop packets for exceeding limits

294
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,320
particularly in processing extension

295
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:04,240
headers so this defines for new

296
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,189
parameter problem codes it extends

297
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
applicability of one parameter problem

298
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:14,080
code and one new destination unreachable

299
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:19,870
code the parameter problem codes one the

300
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:22,990
general parameter problem is used for

301
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:26,678
middle boxes now as opposed to just host

302
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:28,269
so if middle box drops a packet for next

303
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,399
header unknown that's like probably

304
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,629
wrong for next set are known then the

305
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:35,649
middle box connects they send that

306
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:37,330
message four five six and seven of the

307
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:40,508
new proposed codes for parameter

308
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:42,549
problems deal with extension headers so

309
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:45,490
extension header too big this can either

310
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:47,408
be a number I think that's one's number

311
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,600
of bytes extension header chain too long

312
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:51,580
so the sum total of the

313
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,860
and headers exceed some processing limit

314
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:57,010
too many options in an extension header

315
00:22:53,860 --> 00:23:00,699
this is simply a limit of the number of

316
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,830
options and options too big this is

317
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,549
actually a later edition so a particular

318
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,639
option exceeds some limit so that last

319
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:17,260
one we also apply to the number of

320
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:19,059
consecutive pads exceeding seven so we

321
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,090
have some other two other changes as I

322
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:23,830
mentioned we extend the applicability of

323
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,059
perimeter problem code one under

324
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,260
recognized header type to allow

325
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:31,480
immediate notes to send and we added new

326
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:34,539
destination unreachable code parameter

327
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:40,080
num number eight which is headers too

328
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:42,879
long for applicability of to apply to

329
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,158
the situation where the sum total of

330
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,230
headers not just extension headers may

331
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,990
exceed the processing limit of a device

332
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,450
so this might be useful for instance and

333
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,159
a device it has a parsing header limit

334
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,690
and if that's exceeded it ends up

335
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,409
dropping the packets would be nice to

336
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:01,570
know that happen so there's three

337
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:05,740
versions of the draft assertion of a

338
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:07,418
question so for the unrecognized next

339
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,409
header type right like are we somehow

340
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:13,169
changing the assumption that

341
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:15,190
intermediate nodes don't look passing

342
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:16,780
unrecognized next headers because they'd

343
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,270
only require to look at a few that's

344
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,039
Tiffin and IRC all right correct and any

345
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,559
new extension header types that come

346
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,360
after this like the intermediates notes

347
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,730
have no business looking at it at least

348
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,229
from like the specification point of

349
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,080
view right yeah

350
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,400
and and I think I don't know like it's

351
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,470
just a point I want to bring it like you

352
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,330
know consider this before you put this

353
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,950
intermediate notes dollar to send it

354
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,199
because we are changing something not

355
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,960
just a new ICMP error occur but like how

356
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,020
we expect the packets to be treated does

357
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,450
that make sense so I think you're saying

358
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,549
that this is outside of the bounds of

359
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,730
the normal packet processing that these

360
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:57,760
errors are being sent true but the

361
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,929
problem is devices do this and if

362
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,580
they're dropping packets you'd be better

363
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,990
to get the information than not get the

364
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,790
information so somehow we're not

365
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,680
advocating this behavior

366
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,600
but we're acknowledging it exists would

367
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,610
be nice to be informed that they're

368
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,040
doing that okay that's fine I'm just

369
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,780
saying like like and put some scattered

370
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,460
blahblah something around it which

371
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,230
softens it's like saying it's not

372
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,660
something you're sanctioning but we know

373
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,400
it happens okay yes but but just to be

374
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,340
clear here this is purely in the case

375
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,140
where that device has parsed so far into

376
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,429
the packet already that it discovers a

377
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,150
problem right there is no expectation

378
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:33,790
here of a Rooter that doesn't do this to

379
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:37,150
to pass this how far in so we can send

380
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:38,800
this message background yes so I mean I

381
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:42,310
think this is explicitly for routers

382
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,659
with those limits that and then the

383
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,840
question will be okay they kick it into

384
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,940
a slow past is that require a CMP so

385
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,520
there are probably some sub issues but

386
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:56,610
the error is there for that particular

387
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:59,350
case so we have three drafts version one

388
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:02,469
I guess for a truss version one was a

389
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:05,100
working group draft in version 2 and

390
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,050
version 2 and 3 are since last IETF

391
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,540
version two we added the last option

392
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:14,470
option to big or last air code I should

393
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:16,590
say parameter problem code seven and in

394
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,550
version 3 this was mostly just

395
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:25,540
clarifications in the security section

396
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:28,389
and some edits since last IETF there is

397
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:31,720
an implementation against the Linux code

398
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:36,310
so while back in the Linux stack we did

399
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:39,640
add limits per our C 80 504 for

400
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,050
extension headers so we will drop for

401
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,910
instance at the number of hop by hop

402
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:46,300
options exceeds a limit that limit

403
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:49,210
happens to be eight by default so

404
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,159
there's four of these errors are

405
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:55,090
actually used in the implementation so

406
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,100
far the first two are basically sis

407
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,760
cuddles and those have to do with as I

408
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,860
said the RFC 85 of four limits option

409
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,990
the third case they're extension header

410
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,479
too big so this is flight in two cases

411
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,720
one is a normal extension header

412
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,390
exceeding a byte limit but it's also

413
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,500
convenient if padding exceeds the number

414
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:20,170
of pads so our C 85004 for instance

415
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,330
recommends that or suggests there could

416
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,270
be a limit of seven consecutive padding

417
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,710
bytes if that's exceeded the Linux a cat

418
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,790
lease will drop the packet so now we

419
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:34,840
send the extension header to a big

420
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:36,700
message so when I posted this up stream

421
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,030
it got some good feedback from the

422
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,760
net-net dev maintainer he commented that

423
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,470
there were other cases in this

424
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,300
particular block of code we were parsing

425
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,120
extension headers where we were dropping

426
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,760
packets and not sending ICMP errors so

427
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,800
we filled that out in particular one of

428
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,710
the things that Linux does it it does

429
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,960
check patent data bytes to make sure

430
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,800
there's zero so if they're not zero we

431
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,570
now send just a normal header field

432
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,850
parameter problem

433
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,740
the feedback was basically pretty

434
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,500
straightforward really can't take this

435
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,690
into upstream Linux without the former

436
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:18,220
Layana assignments so a little bit of a

437
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:20,760
chicken and egg problem there so like

438
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,740
one thing we can do if the chairs like

439
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,150
do a consensus call on the list asking

440
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,730
for an early allocation we can actually

441
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:30,700
go and get an allocation right now right

442
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:32,260
and then it it expires in some amount of

443
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,030
time like I know nine months or like a

444
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,460
year or something so you can get the

445
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,560
code points lock them down and put them

446
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,630
in the implementations and the traffic

447
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,370
can progress in parallel so that's like

448
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,320
a mechanism I'm offering to you like

449
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,879
chairs just at the request knee okay so

450
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,879
just request the assignment without

451
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,260
allocation to the chairs they do a call

452
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,820
and then okay to see any foresee any

453
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,980
issues asking for I think we're asking

454
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,360
for new codes five new codes actually

455
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,360
okay great

456
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,460
question I have is this ready for

457
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:17,100
working group last call or what else do

458
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:20,140
we need don't all run to microphones so

459
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,820
how many people would be willing to

460
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:28,260
review this as a part of a working group

461
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:29,500
last call one two three four five six

462
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,030
fantastic

463
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,180
I didn't need my fret

464
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:38,230
shall plan after seven and excellently I

465
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:41,500
do remember you so come back to you yes

466
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,000
I think I think we're ready to to last

467
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,640
call this and we'll send that

468
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,980
announcement out as soon as we can okay

469
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:56,230
thank you okay the next one is bobbing

470
00:29:50,980 --> 00:30:07,300
Gauri I think are you both going in the

471
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:10,020
pink box so so it's only a pink sex this

472
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,020
time no bars

473
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:21,160
so I'm Cory I'm Bob so just as a summary

474
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,570
as you all know path MTU discovery

475
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:29,350
doesn't work too well on the Internet

476
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:31,600
we came up with this idea that it might

477
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,399
be more reliable for the destination to

478
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,909
send the feedback back to the source

479
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,620
there's a better trust relationship but

480
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,080
we understand this may not work in all

481
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:44,770
places and this sort of what we're

482
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:48,129
trying to find out changes in the

483
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:52,000
current draft we change the option

484
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:55,450
format to include the return value and a

485
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,790
recurring flag and we I think we talked

486
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,520
about we tried this have in the previous

487
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:04,330
hackathon but we made some we've moved

488
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:10,450
over the flag to the the least low order

489
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:12,520
bit in the last two bytes and we're no

490
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,340
longer because we have a return value

491
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,920
we're no longer using the ICMP packet do

492
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:21,389
big messages were just you send this in

493
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,220
another hop-by-hop option back to the

494
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,740
source or you know you send your own you

495
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,650
can include this and so there were a lot

496
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:32,500
of text changes relating to this we also

497
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:35,920
added acknowledgment section that there

498
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:40,300
was a similar mechanism proposed in 1988

499
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,700
for ipv4 that was didn't go too far

500
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,980
because they abandoned it with the

501
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,669
current you know ipv4

502
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:51,070
MTU discovery had they only known that

503
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:55,330
we wouldn't be doing this today

504
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:58,090
and a bunch of editorial changes so and

505
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,949
here's the here's the new formats I'm

506
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,740
sure you've all read the draft but you

507
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:05,140
can see the return flag at the end and

508
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:08,950
we named the fields instead of value one

509
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:15,190
and value two so this is what's in the

510
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:16,780
current draft so we we've implemented it

511
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,210
and we have something in why sharklet

512
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,530
works but we need to work out if it

513
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,530
actually works the internet which seems

514
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:25,570
like the more important question and so

515
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,309
we need to do people to do experiments

516
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,100
we planted your experiments the first

517
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:34,570
one is do hop-by-hop options really work

518
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:36,100
we really hope so what size of empath

519
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,379
interior's have actually supported and

520
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,840
where are the MTU bottlenecks and we

521
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,130
don't know the answer to this so that's

522
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,540
why we building the tool but we need to

523
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,669
have do a bit of mapping for this and

524
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,159
what happens in practice when we try and

525
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:51,460
do this when we have the crazy real

526
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,440
internet and well we're going to do this

527
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,390
work and we would love other people to

528
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:01,570
join us so it's a plea for other people

529
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:04,270
to say this is fun oh and so we did do

530
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:08,470
we hit a smaller hackathon project Olli

531
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:10,660
worked on his VPP radical notation and I

532
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,270
learned how to actually instead of doing

533
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,820
a Lua plug-in I learned with a lot of

534
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:19,870
help how to actually modify Wireshark

535
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:23,110
you know change the packet - ipv6 dot C

536
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:26,320
file and with some other help we finally

537
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:30,070
have it working as you can maybe read

538
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,020
this but it now shows the option and and

539
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,610
more importantly with the thing we

540
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,980
couldn't do with the Lua plug-in it

541
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,559
actually shows correctly what's after

542
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,580
this header which the previous one

543
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,860
didn't do so at least that's working and

544
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:51,100
unfortunately I know a little bit about

545
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:52,689
Wireshark now so we want to continue the

546
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,178
experiments we're looking for other

547
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,570
people to help with this occurred that

548
00:33:55,179 --> 00:34:02,559
someone is going to have some boxes that

549
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:05,158
can deploy and we would like to working

550
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,139
group to adopt this it's currently

551
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:11,050
labeled as experimental but I think we

552
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:13,690
can still do that and and if there's

553
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:16,929
interest we would we would like to ask

554
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:19,480
the ad for so we can do an early I Ana

555
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,069
allocation and the the reason for this

556
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,179
is we want to do internet wide

557
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:24,730
experimentation

558
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:27,250
you know the experimental values are

559
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,589
just fine for doing it on the table in

560
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,659
hackathon but to run it over the

561
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:33,489
internet I think we really need code

562
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:37,060
points that won't conflict with other

563
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:45,609
experiments so we would like to do both

564
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:50,369
of these things so questions comments hi

565
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:53,889
my name is Tim Shepherd this sometimes

566
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,740
the IMP eat into you bottleneck is in a

567
00:34:53,889 --> 00:35:02,079
box that does not look at the IP header

568
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:03,549
and in which case the box that is

569
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,000
looking at the IP header and the

570
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,609
extension headers might not even know

571
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,450
about an MTU bottleneck between it and

572
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:15,910
its next hop IP layer thing and so that

573
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,950
I mean so just as long as you all

574
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:22,420
understand the limitation of this this

575
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,890
easy answer to this yes but and okay so

576
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,050
there's two places we could you use this

577
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:28,390
one was in an area where you're actually

578
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,920
configuring equipment and you intend it

579
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,319
all to work and you just got different

580
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,200
time to use then it probably will work

581
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:37,270
in the big bad internet maybe you to

582
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,270
couple it with something magic like DPL

583
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:42,250
PMT UD or PM tud or something to

584
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:46,150
discover all these other facets it still

585
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:48,609
helps yeah I just add to that I mean

586
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:51,040
we're not expecting this to be the magic

587
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:53,319
bullet that makes this perfect we think

588
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,290
this is we're trying to figure out if

589
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:58,240
this is a useful tool that will help you

590
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,490
know the transport will need to fall

591
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,828
back to whatever information it can

592
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,839
obtain whether it's stuff that figures

593
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:07,510
out or whether it gets feedback like

594
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:10,450
this or you know nodes that don't

595
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:12,380
support this may still do you know send

596
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,538
ICMP packet to big messages

597
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:19,490
all of that feedback needs to be dealt

598
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:21,710
with tell Herbert so I really love the

599
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,029
kind of hidden bullet point there that

600
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,619
we were going to do some experiments to

601
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:27,769
see if extension headers work over the

602
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:29,779
intranet again be fantastic if we could

603
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:34,879
have fresher data than RFC I think it's

604
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:36,680
78 72 and not only that if you do this

605
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,259
experiment and I certainly would

606
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,549
volunteer to help can we make this kind

607
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:45,019
of ongoing to measure the progression of

608
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:47,809
the deployment of extension headers is

609
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:49,970
hopefully the situation's improving but

610
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:52,819
right now without data obvious they were

611
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:55,160
in the dark on it yeah that's probably

612
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:57,200
all yes but it'd be really good to have

613
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,788
some useful headers and here's an

614
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,788
example of potentially useful header

615
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:07,038
generous next yes Cheers

616
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:09,259
Jenning call someone who actually

617
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,589
promised to get you dating I'm working

618
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,390
on it

619
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,680
I'm in the middle of the experiment so

620
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,950
you won't get some additional

621
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,799
measurements on extension headers and so

622
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:20,180
I like this again how useful it is we'll

623
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:22,460
see after we do some measurements right

624
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,740
it's really early to say if you if you

625
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,349
actually can do it internet scale yeah

626
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,169
but I support this idea and I think here

627
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:33,470
we need to run internet wide like

628
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,910
actually get in I don't know Robert here

629
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,470
could you get there when we get the

630
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,649
option can we get right partners to

631
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:42,709
support this it would it might help with

632
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,099
the measurement but we definitely can

633
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,099
try something

634
00:37:47,890 --> 00:38:00,140
Julia Glee yeah so I I like the idea of

635
00:37:57,259 --> 00:38:02,089
experimentation I would like to see if

636
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,859
in fact there are some places on the

637
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:08,450
internet that you can pass hop-by-hop

638
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:11,058
options through I know in the case of my

639
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,189
network that because those actually have

640
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:15,589
to be sent up to the control plane I

641
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:19,130
will never see them because I can't

642
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:24,049
process them so I know how that

643
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:26,780
experiment is going to go but um

644
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,520
you know maybe it's possible to build a

645
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,880
router architecture that can actually do

646
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,480
that these days I'm not sure someone's

647
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,330
gonna write a p4 specifically to process

648
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,110
a hop-by-hop option and use half a

649
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:43,970
billion transistors to help make ICMP

650
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,240
forward better but maybe they will I

651
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:50,000
don't know well I mean the the part of

652
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,069
the motivation usually jolts a part of

653
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,680
the motivation for this is environments

654
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,660
where you can have links with larger MT

655
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,450
is to actually be able to use them and

656
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:03,009
we're hoping that that might be enough

657
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:08,540
incentive well I can use the link MTU of

658
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:11,119
16 K right now but I don't really think

659
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:15,259
I can forward packets up to my control

660
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:23,080
plane and 400 gigabit rates for possibly

661
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:26,240
obvious reasons will of this measurement

662
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:29,270
using a combination of Google's online

663
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,669
ads to get a massive number of insights

664
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:34,790
all forwarding back to a small number of

665
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,609
servers and this is a TCP conversation

666
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:42,830
so the server's basically send out

667
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:44,500
mangled packets and look for the ACK we

668
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:49,029
did this a few hundred million times

669
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:51,320
remember last year the a crate was bad

670
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,510
we're getting a failure rate of these

671
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,869
kind of packets between 30 and 36

672
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:59,060
percent so it's it's the it's pretty

673
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:02,030
gloomy out there there's an awful lot of

674
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,820
dropping of extension headers I've no

675
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,880
idea why we are looking at doing this on

676
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:12,290
an ongoing basis for both UDP for the

677
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,180
DNS and TCP and we'll put up a page or

678
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,430
something and sort of publish it more

679
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,460
regularly but you know the base level

680
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:21,129
data is for whatever reason deployed v6

681
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,480
equipment out there on transit links

682
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:32,570
seems to be very extension header

683
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:34,310
hostile detailer so let's a assume for

684
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,900
the sake of argument right now that you

685
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,670
have a path that

686
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,589
does not drop packets with how high up

687
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,990
options thanks both rewrite my

688
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:45,599
understanding of what your draft talks

689
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:48,328
about is that if you don't understand it

690
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,660
you just pass it on right and so this

691
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:53,130
actually does not discover the path MTU

692
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,899
this discovers an upper bound on it

693
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,249
right because the hidden node may have

694
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,400
something lower right so it gives you an

695
00:40:56,249 --> 00:41:02,220
upper bound on the path MTU

696
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,230
correct it only works and yeah it

697
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:07,709
provides you an immediate hint of a big

698
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:10,259
empty it it provides the a hint at the

699
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,599
path MTU in the same sense as your local

700
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:14,970
view of your current link into you does

701
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,849
right which is it's an upper bound right

702
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,470
now you observe at the beginning that

703
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:21,230
PMT UD has problems across the internet

704
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:25,140
and yeah you can get this information

705
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:27,749
what are you gonna use it for we have a

706
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,690
routine in detail PMT UT which takes IP

707
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:34,680
p t be processing this isn't even easy

708
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:39,059
at once what's a hint for use in PL m tu

709
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,299
d yes PL annotation way it's a hint for

710
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:41,910
this

711
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:43,380
so it's an optimization for that right I

712
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,450
just want to caution you can't actually

713
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,859
rely on this and use it as a path into

714
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,779
you because it's not it's just a number

715
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:52,430
about yeah sure because it's Ethernet

716
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:52,430
switches on the way either in the middle

717
00:41:53,690 --> 00:42:01,230
Erik line the question the RFC was this

718
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:03,960
two four six four I think

719
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:08,460
ipv6 over Ethernet basically says if

720
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:12,150
it's 1500 which is greater than 1500 it

721
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:14,749
should be ignored and logged there's an

722
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,849
exception for manual whatever of course

723
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:23,308
we want to like update that as well at

724
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:24,960
some point oh yeah I think I Triple E

725
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:27,509
also sort of says something like that

726
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,450
tubes and somehow people managed to do

727
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:33,059
it I mean I don't know what happens if i

728
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,700
if i say 9k in an MTU and tooth like

729
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:38,910
this it properly get ignored or does it

730
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,379
probably get honored in you're not in an

731
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,788
RA not necessarily I mean you have

732
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,230
manually you can figure that that that

733
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:49,359
works based on the driver I guess but

734
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:52,920
yeah okay so I think I want to do a howl

735
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,749
see if there's interest in adopting this

736
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,720
so can the people who are in favor of

737
00:42:55,749 --> 00:43:05,950
making this a working document please

738
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:08,200
come now and those who are violently

739
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:13,720
against please harm us loud as you can

740
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:15,759
now and those who rather want to go to

741
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:21,419
the social and didn't pay attention can

742
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:24,940
him now mm-hmm that was the loudest yeah

743
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,559
okay I heard you know there's there's so

744
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:30,039
many interests for this I you know will

745
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,609
confirm that on on the mailing list okay

746
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:35,069
excellent

747
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:39,519
I think Pascal you are up next

748
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:44,700
you have you have ten minutes on the

749
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:46,868
agenda for these are a bit extra and

750
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,149
because I don't think we will have time

751
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:51,039
for the extra course to try to stop it

752
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,170
now so you have the rest of the so you

753
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,269
have 17 minutes well that is a to like

754
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:58,480
you talks that ask our wanna introduce

755
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:01,598
that comes from mostly from six low

756
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,720
right well these districts actually

757
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,529
triggered by work at I like your wife

758
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:12,129
working with the IPF guy guys as int

759
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:16,089
dear reviewer and IOT trul I realized

760
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:17,890
that we we kind of needed a common

761
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:20,349
framework to understanding to understand

762
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,210
how we could map ipv6 all radios so that

763
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:23,890
people coming in with a particular radio

764
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:27,130
could actually refer to that because

765
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:28,779
there was a lot of ingenuity in in the

766
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,789
way they approach the problem so I

767
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:32,980
thought I could write paper just

768
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:36,309
specific to IP why if I could just try

769
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,160
to see if if 6-0 can agree on on the

770
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,630
various models that we could apply to

771
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:46,269
25gb six of our wireless so I need to

772
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:48,099
put this draft okay so a lot of much

773
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:50,379
time I presented that at six know many

774
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:52,960
more slides so I just picked three

775
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,910
that's the chairs required and so it's

776
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,960
three different angles of the first bra

777
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:00,970
or the same prom this slide is all about

778
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,779
the expectation that people doing

779
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:07,009
wireless would have found on the night

780
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:09,589
six naval discovery method and well

781
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:13,609
there is quite a mismatch so the first

782
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:17,029
point which we hurts is that usually for

783
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:18,949
most radios the medium is not transitive

784
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:20,989
it is usually reflexive do not

785
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:23,059
necessarily like if I can talk to be

786
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:24,439
usually we can talk to I it's not

787
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:26,150
necessarily true right you have

788
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:27,828
difference of power you get interference

789
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,049
on one side you've got lots of effects

790
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:31,999
that make me may make it so it's not

791
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:34,339
reflexive but most of the time it is

792
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:36,919
what it is not is transitive like if you

793
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:39,589
have ABC in this picture you get the

794
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:41,749
broadcast domain of ABC I can talk to B

795
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:43,909
we can talk to C but I cannot talk to C

796
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:46,368
so if there is a dad message I'll look

797
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:48,439
up and it's just broadcasted by a on his

798
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:50,929
broadcast domain then C will not be able

799
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:52,308
to respond so that's that's the basic

800
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:54,439
thing which appears that most of the

801
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:57,409
radios around with the exception of

802
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:59,989
Wi-Fi because Wi-Fi provides a mat level

803
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:01,579
emulation of a broadcast domain by using

804
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:04,400
the broadcast domain of the AP as the

805
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:08,509
reference but even if you're there

806
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,789
ng again fails to be feeling all its

807
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:13,789
promises and in particular it hurts a

808
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:16,179
lot because of the the broadcast that it

809
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:18,769
generates we've we've done measures

810
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:21,169
recently there was the Cisco live like a

811
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:22,158
month ago and there was this big room

812
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:24,788
for the keynote

813
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:27,979
it was very well attended thank you and

814
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:31,009
we kind of measured the network for the

815
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:34,158
hour and a half of the keynote and found

816
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:35,529
that ipv6 and degenerated 300 messages

817
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,900
per second during the whole show

818
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:40,939
averaged 300 message per second

819
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,650
broadcast about the whole thing during

820
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:44,379
one hour and a half think about the

821
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,429
battery of your device during that time

822
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,219
okay and that could have been completely

823
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:51,439
avoided if we add the method that we

824
00:46:49,219 --> 00:46:53,259
have deployed at six low by the way and

825
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:56,269
then there are a number of other

826
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:58,630
mismatches that appear for instance

827
00:46:56,269 --> 00:47:01,640
there was a great effort at a to 2.11

828
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:03,169
called feels a totally divine AI which

829
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,328
is kind of the Tokyo Station

830
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:07,098
use case where you get 200 people or

831
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:08,689
going out of trying the station they

832
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:10,189
want instant connectivity and there was

833
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:12,199
a lot of effort at dogeleven

834
00:47:10,189 --> 00:47:13,788
to give them the almost instant

835
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,620
connectivity love them all at cetera

836
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:19,320
give them access and then you know

837
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,910
the Jen's draft you realize that within

838
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,860
a number of seconds a good number of

839
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:25,560
that still don't get ipv6 connectivity

840
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:29,550
hopefully do IP before but for at least

841
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,610
another game so this is just one example

842
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:35,850
but there's also all the sensitive does

843
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:39,510
attacks etc so ng is not history but it

844
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:41,910
is certainly archaic so that's that's

845
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:45,600
one angle applying just ND to most of

846
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:47,879
the radios around now this draft is not

847
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,470
specifically about end it's about more

848
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,450
like what kind of models we want to

849
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:53,279
apply was the link was some network can

850
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,689
have subnet do you want to be out is the

851
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,220
subnet bigger than the link is the link

852
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,230
bigger than the certain nodes it amount

853
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,359
links and that all those games so we try

854
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,040
to model that and provoke you know just

855
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,050
give a name to the different approaches

856
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,880
an interesting one is what is your link

857
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,320
right a previous six is the link is the

858
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,240
medium for communication between two

859
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,860
devices well that's fine what do you

860
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,319
mean by medium is layer two major

861
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,790
military of one medium if you look at

862
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,340
your layer one medium that's my

863
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:20,580
broadcast domain on my broadcast domain

864
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,590
I can talk but I mean who can I talk to

865
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:26,370
can i stablish of point-to-point link

866
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:28,110
right if I do that if I start my radio

867
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,180
in the morning and I do that on an ipv6

868
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,880
link local twice if I walk all day with

869
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:34,859
my radio on do I consider that the dad I

870
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,420
did in the morning is still valid two

871
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,720
hours later when I crossed off of the

872
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:42,180
world probably not so he realized that a

873
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,009
demand on which I can assert the

874
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,649
uniqueness of my link local choice is

875
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,490
probably appear that I'm talking to a

876
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,670
Deming Claire

877
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:52,290
meaning that a link is probably a pair

878
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,420
of devices communicating with one

879
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,220
another that when they start

880
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,080
assert that it should also dress is

881
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,970
unique from each other's perspective and

882
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,009
that's how 6lo modeled

883
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,390
actually the radio domain doesn't mean

884
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,130
that the subnet is that for instance

885
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,440
here I just have one of the possible

886
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:10,770
model which is hub and spoke well by the

887
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:15,720
router in the middle can use same prefix

888
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:17,580
to talk prefix be 64 can be used for a

889
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,160
and C 2 for matrices and they can all

890
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,290
talk together as long as B exposes the

891
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,330
prefix as not a link and realized by CAD

892
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:28,380
between a and C so the model that you

893
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:29,569
are used to in in BSS which is Wi-Fi

894
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,280
current of this

895
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:34,010
can completely apply in the X news

896
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,340
unfortunately or three if you don't have

897
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:40,040
a layer to BSS we can do it at layer 3

898
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,390
thank you exactly the same model and

899
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,360
that's what we did at 6000 we just

900
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:47,660
reproduced what is known to work well in

901
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:51,820
dot eleven yeah infrastructure mode and

902
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,819
we just replicated that at layer 3 Oh

903
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,480
last but not least angle of this

904
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,460
discussion is can we do everything that

905
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,230
we want already with the method we have

906
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,140
at layer 3 not exactly

907
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,670
there are even for IP wife even based on

908
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:07,160
everything we have at 6lo there are

909
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,710
still things which could be improved 6lo

910
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,339
mostly country considered devices that

911
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:15,830
don't remove a lot and well I did cut

912
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:18,950
that in our authors like 15 years ago

913
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:20,360
realized that if I had to tweak nd to

914
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:23,089
get a mobile router to work and the

915
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,560
reason is for instance Andy doesn't tell

916
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:26,660
you if you have to match the pre-flight

917
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,340
as you don't have to match the prefix

918
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,859
that the router gives away and the

919
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,720
source address that you use so if you're

920
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:35,060
moving with your radio on and you get a

921
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,830
rise as you go and you form address this

922
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,380
with all those prefixes that you hear as

923
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,779
you go and then you use any of the

924
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,130
dresses that you've formed to you with

925
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,860
any of the routers that you've heard

926
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:49,100
about there's a good chance that the

927
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,480
router that you use is gone or doesn't

928
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,910
know the prefix that you're using and

929
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,980
will filter it out so if you if your

930
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,960
mobile and and you don't even have a

931
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,340
link layer method to detect the routers

932
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,660
you have around which is the case of a

933
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,780
CB 4.11

934
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:05,210
then you probably want to have new

935
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,850
things that you do income including

936
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:09,980
matching the address with the router I

937
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,240
get this Pio from that router I'm using

938
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,700
this source address I'm using that

939
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,839
router it's unusual for Andy it's not

940
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,850
the right thing maybe in some

941
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,530
environments it's it's pretty much the

942
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:21,710
thing you have to do if you do IP Mobile

943
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,210
IP and and part of that game is also how

944
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:26,420
you manage your default router list

945
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:28,310
because maybe this router uses the array

946
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,750
interval and and speaks every 100

947
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,310
milliseconds with a new array that's

948
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,550
very good as a layer 3 because that's

949
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:36,110
how you do the 30 level we can but this

950
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,150
was a router speaks every minute but I

951
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:40,160
just heard about it so which one should

952
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:42,140
I use the one that speaks every minute

953
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,180
but I just heard all the one that tells

954
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,160
me is going to

955
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,169
beacon every 100 milliseconds that's a

956
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,049
sort of logic that you have to invent as

957
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,520
you go and I did my own like you know

958
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:53,440
alright as long ago when I did those

959
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,300
experiments but there is no standard for

960
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,710
doing this and probably the wrong saying

961
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:01,599
it appear to work if we want to enable

962
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:03,640
model things like the scores of our CV

963
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,220
then we'll have to reconsider those

964
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,569
things so the era interval that we have

965
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:10,720
in mobile IP is the beginning of that

966
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:13,960
story that emulates the beacon but then

967
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,339
how you manage your care of address and

968
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,530
match it with the router this is not

969
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:20,470
described anywhere so that's pretty much

970
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:22,510
what I had on this slide so if you want

971
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:25,180
more slides I present any 6lo just

972
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:28,210
download them from 6lo if you want more

973
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,618
time next time I can go all the subnet

974
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,940
models and discuss that otherwise

975
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:33,130
there's a draft

976
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,230
but the question to the room is is there

977
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:37,510
interest in six-man to document all

978
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:39,670
those possibilities and those stakes all

979
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,770
right the draft is published I can leave

980
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:44,200
it like that I can extend it tons of

981
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:49,660
things I could write in there is an

982
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:52,808
interest I mean in the past we have we

983
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:57,069
have worked on you know any dad issues

984
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:59,500
we had the efficient nd work which which

985
00:52:57,069 --> 00:53:02,020
did spam but I do wonder if if the world

986
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,650
has moved on this one is this one is

987
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:07,569
more it's not on a track it's more

988
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:09,280
informational like your things right you

989
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:11,140
know here is how you could play with

990
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,299
your radio here is how you could map ng

991
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,710
with with traditional ng you can do this

992
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:17,650
with 6lowpan

993
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:19,569
ng you can do that and here is what you

994
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:21,790
still cannot do kind of it's it's more

995
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:24,329
this level if you want to solve anything

996
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:27,549
I don't expect it to be this draft right

997
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:29,770
so I wanted to see if you know is - is

998
00:53:27,549 --> 00:53:33,940
there some interest in in restarting

999
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:37,960
work in this area or ends up in security

1000
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:39,880
I've read the draft for once I this

1001
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,760
draft is sort of like not even almost

1002
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:47,020
about restarting work I think it's

1003
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:48,460
there's a good summary of things that

1004
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,470
have been done in the past and then

1005
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,420
different link layers and and what the

1006
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,220
underlying semantics of the links are

1007
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,630
and what you can do with them

1008
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:59,220
it's

1009
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:02,160
it's heavily biased towards what was

1010
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,080
done already and it's sort of a little

1011
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,810
bit biased against like classic can be

1012
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,549
there's a few sort of like we recommend

1013
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,990
this and we recommend that which doesn't

1014
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,730
really belong in informational but I

1015
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:14,580
think as a document itself is actually

1016
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:16,170
useful too because it presents its

1017
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,850
relatively neutral and it presents like

1018
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,310
a lot of the trade-offs that were made

1019
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:23,400
but it I don't know that it's something

1020
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:25,020
that though we need to work on it's sort

1021
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,160
of like it's almost complete as is right

1022
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:31,230
I wonder if it just should be you know

1023
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:34,529
published as an IC or something it's a

1024
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:36,980
useful document for sure but I don't

1025
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:40,700
think that it's kicking off work if we

1026
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:43,290
it seems like mostly complete already I

1027
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,060
hope it's gonna help the work at MP yef

1028
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,710
because that was the initial goal but I

1029
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:50,759
thought publishing it that IP wife was

1030
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:52,230
too limited no point of doing that this

1031
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,910
is just introduced to work and will

1032
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:58,530
continue on so this one is not a

1033
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,690
six-month rush but they don't know where

1034
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:03,240
it should it should live actually we

1035
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:05,370
asked the question at six low on the the

1036
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,080
sense of the room and of the ad if I

1037
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,549
thought if I remember well was that it

1038
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,529
would be better at six at six men and

1039
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:12,120
six low so this is the logical

1040
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,650
continuation of the world that happened

1041
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,130
at six low the world that happen at six

1042
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:22,410
low was really looking at the world side

1043
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:24,120
trying to optimize the multicast but we

1044
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,980
realized that probably are some of those

1045
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:29,460
aspect that we could actually port it to

1046
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,260
a more general news age so what do we

1047
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,210
try to address here the first thing we

1048
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:37,560
try to address is the scalability of a

1049
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:39,630
ninety six subnet and if you rely on

1050
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,880
multi-level emulation of a broadcast

1051
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,860
domain of our large fabric well that

1052
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,150
that's fine on the limited Ethernet

1053
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,860
switch fabric if you have a lot of

1054
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:48,900
wireless edge it's already starts to

1055
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,730
work if you distribute your layer to

1056
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,700
fabric of a layer three multiple data

1057
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,110
centers that really hurts a lot what we

1058
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,270
do in those networks is we build

1059
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:59,340
overlays and we want to resolve the

1060
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,600
other hand of the tunnel we don't want

1061
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,550
to have to broadcast anything

1062
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,009
it happens that today with outcome

1063
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:07,110
fabric we still do have to do broadcast

1064
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:09,450
because our cases where we don't resolve

1065
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:12,680
the tree hurts

1066
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:16,140
so what we would like to do is do our

1067
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:18,660
solution through a mapping server most

1068
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:22,049
of them in pure unicast and avoid the

1069
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:25,319
the broadcast so today my cup initial

1070
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:27,690
solution based on Lisp to do that so we

1071
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:29,400
have this map server my preserver and

1072
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,530
you can create with Lisp and if you do

1073
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,420
that then you can save a lookup you can

1074
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:35,609
save the broadcast on your fabric but

1075
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:38,549
what we don't have is a generic way of

1076
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:41,460
doing that through the most logical way

1077
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:43,109
which is neighbor discovery so the idea

1078
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:47,280
behind this draft is pretty much to say

1079
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:49,440
a we already have this in six low the

1080
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,940
software registrar where we list all the

1081
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,530
addresses in the in the network that

1082
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:56,210
were registered that's how we do that

1083
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:59,000
over multiple routers in a big fabric

1084
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:02,760
why don't we just look at this thing

1085
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,460
using the same ng methods so you could

1086
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,260
use to the draft purposes just then

1087
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,059
let's look up but you send it unique as

1088
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:12,900
to this guy it's the first thing you can

1089
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:14,790
do or if if it's actually not on your

1090
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,760
broadcast link like if you're on a

1091
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,380
wireless Wi-Fi and we do this backbone

1092
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,809
router game and the proxy which is

1093
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,579
actually recommended by Wi-Fi then you

1094
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:25,319
will have make a packet that goes

1095
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:27,030
multiple hops because you have to go to

1096
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:28,558
the router or it's different links you

1097
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,119
have a backbone link which is

1098
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,309
represented on the right here by this

1099
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,930
Ethernet backbone and you have the

1100
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:35,400
wireless link and there are two

1101
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,540
different links like it's an S and

1102
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,480
literally news

1103
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:42,450
multi-link subnet so if you live in a

1104
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,790
world like this then the database is not

1105
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:46,828
on your link it's on on the broadcast

1106
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:48,480
domain on the ethernet meaning that you

1107
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:50,430
need a packet which goes multiple hops

1108
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,980
which is what six laws provided anyway

1109
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:55,259
so what the drafters mostly is take the

1110
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,599
six low signaling which can go multiple

1111
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:59,819
hop which is called dag duplicate that

1112
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,160
was request if you get address confirm

1113
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:05,640
and this tended to do a lookup so now we

1114
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,700
have a new code same ICMP code right we

1115
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,490
don't serve as a p-type we don't go

1116
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:13,828
beyond the user new ICMP type but we

1117
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:17,160
have code and sub code in there and so

1118
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:19,319
we just take in that space and allow

1119
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,680
this multi-hop message to be a lookup as

1120
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:24,670
opposed to just that request

1121
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:27,980
that's pretty much what the message says

1122
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:30,410
ten minutes okay one one on this slide

1123
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,240
wouldn't next so this is just giving you

1124
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:33,589
an example so all the six low drafts

1125
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,499
basically which talk about the backbone

1126
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:38,029
are really meant to coexist it doesn't

1127
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:41,538
mean that you have to have either the

1128
00:58:38,029 --> 00:58:43,160
broadcast games the old ng or six low nd

1129
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:45,619
you can have both at the same time it's

1130
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:48,890
romantic coexist there is what would

1131
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:51,710
happen in the fields use case no a to

1132
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:54,348
deliver the I where all those hundreds

1133
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:56,269
of people jump out of the Train so any

1134
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:59,269
of those guys would basically send an

1135
00:58:56,269 --> 00:59:01,098
arrest to locate the router it's it's

1136
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:03,019
supposed to be a multicast but since the

1137
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:04,549
access point is a router and the access

1138
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:06,109
point is the one that that's a real

1139
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:07,640
broadcast it to just will not do that

1140
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,650
because it's a router so it will just

1141
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,299
intercept the errors and the rest will

1142
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:14,809
never be broadcasted on the otherwise

1143
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:18,890
network then it will answer unicast

1144
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:20,690
arise that's immediate and even so the

1145
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:23,150
now the 6ln cannot take off from the

1146
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:24,980
truss as many as it likes and it

1147
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:27,049
registers them to the 6lb arm which

1148
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,730
means that we pre populate the nd cache

1149
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:34,038
that's the important thing right will

1150
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:37,789
pre-populate the any cash so now if if

1151
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:39,769
there is this is a registration so you

1152
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:42,710
register the rotor the register writes

1153
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:44,808
it down on the central registry and now

1154
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:45,950
we can do optimistic that pretty much

1155
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:50,509
that's what's happening here

1156
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:53,839
so the the whole sent well also on the

1157
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:55,549
articles as a proxy centenares to the

1158
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,369
router without a sale ago because that's

1159
00:59:55,549 --> 01:00:01,660
what add the router looks wants to

1160
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:05,059
outside unicast so it sends an S and I

1161
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:07,519
and and that's how the router gets

1162
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:09,859
populated and now in optimistic mode the

1163
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,569
ipv6 packets can start right over so you

1164
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:13,880
don't have any deal I just a few

1165
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:16,308
exchanges and then you go you can start

1166
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,950
exchanging your data so that that's

1167
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:22,069
pretty much what we can do in ipv6 to

1168
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:25,509
finish what the Dutch Levin AI group

1169
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:29,480
does grow started at a to that sea level

1170
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:30,920
and that's pretty much my talk so we put

1171
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,349
the central registrar that we already

1172
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,630
have anyway we give an NG interface to

1173
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:38,210
it so that any host can register to it

1174
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:40,640
and the most most host register to it

1175
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:42,710
the last podcast you'll get doing okay

1176
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,410
that's pretty much what you have super

1177
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,450
Thank You Pascal and the blue sheets

1178
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:50,299
please and we're done for today but

1179
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:52,370
we'll reconvene on Thursday afternoon in

1180
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:58,820
the neighboring room I hope to see you

1181
