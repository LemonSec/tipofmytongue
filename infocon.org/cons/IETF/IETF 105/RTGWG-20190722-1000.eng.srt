00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,469
[Music]

3
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:01,800
we've got greatness for use whoever

4
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,140
brought blocking protocols to ETF asked

5
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,479
us

6
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,430
welcome to Montrell get the co and we

7
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,670
are about to start first route in

8
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:22,520
working group meeting we'll start with

9
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:25,259
the mr. TV so myself and crease and

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,670
engine his secretary unfortunately

11
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,869
couldn't make it she is following us

12
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,180
remotely not well everything said this

13
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:41,720
class this property of ATF please read

14
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:44,880
that well before disclosing anything our

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,550
specific to rowdy Martin group process

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,360
any time document change the status so

17
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,509
it goes from a government to working

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,280
group document or progressing to RFC

19
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,590
will require you to provide ITR

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,070
statement and disclosures and unless

21
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,720
every outer counter and contributor have

22
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,990
provided it documents not going to

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,990
progress

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:22,340
anyone on jabber anyone for jabber

25
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,340
okay

26
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:41,870
let's look at working group governments

27
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:46,800
we've got one year FCAT 541 an impact on

28
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:50,430
SPF triggers and delays to documents

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,840
submitted to is G read document has been

30
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,610
in limbo for almost two years so I

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,090
conducted our sirs and I think we are

32
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:04,620
trying to progress documents by moving

33
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:08,690
some parts of it into informal PA multi

34
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,690
Jamica columns ready city follow up

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:18,840
gruff anyway so the informal document

36
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,190
has been in this state for over a year

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,410
we are still waiting for Shepherd review

38
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,060
if current Shepherd cannot provide one

39
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,980
would be great if he would communicate

40
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,980
it to us and we'll look for someone else

41
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:42,870
the far decian jobs initiative us

42
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,489
published two arousing working group is

43
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,070
currently progressing through

44
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:53,700
independent stream so just so you know

45
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:57,660
the Q s model young model is a candidate

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:01,290
for W the forwarding reproduction and

47
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:05,250
going to be presented today there's

48
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:08,670
number of existing government's policy

49
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:12,180
model and the Reeb extent model have

50
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,030
asked for further progress so we'll

51
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:20,570
discussing on the list and this pretty

52
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,570
much it Linda

53
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:49,318
hello okay

54
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:53,849
good morning so today I'm going to give

55
00:04:49,319 --> 00:05:02,940
update on the led to cloud problem

56
00:04:53,849 --> 00:05:08,009
statement and gap analysis so the update

57
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:12,440
since 104 in last idea we got quite a

58
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:16,770
few comments some of the comments about

59
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,500
how does SD one place in the network to

60
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:23,330
the cloud data center so for the problem

61
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:27,020
statement we specifically add a section

62
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:31,320
how the SD when placing this domain

63
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:34,289
cloud data center itself it's really

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:38,419
they can interconnect themselves and

65
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:41,280
then the problem is for Enterprise

66
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:44,090
instantiating their workload into the

67
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,190
cloud data center because of the

68
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,609
geographic location the proximity to

69
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:54,060
their end users the most enterprises

70
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:57,750
tend to instantiate their workload to

71
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:01,020
the locations which is suitable to their

72
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,560
usage so the the workload becomes

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:08,159
ephemeral like they change when they can

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,750
be instantiating location one another

75
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:17,430
time can be instantiation - so the

76
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,009
location being changing in form many of

77
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,240
the service program enterprises their

78
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:27,090
current of APN provider may not have the

79
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,589
physical connection to the location they

80
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,900
desire so that's how the st1 place them

81
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:37,200
the important role in to dynamically

82
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:42,109
connecting the workload and especially

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,110
able to connect to multiple locations

84
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:49,830
and we also got comments about on the V

85
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:53,970
PC itself is it's called virtual private

86
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:57,359
cloud what it really is is really kind

87
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:00,990
of virtual network dedicated to one

88
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,210
tenant the like actually as one

89
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,750
enterprise they could have multiple

90
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:10,640
virtual private cloud multiple virtual

91
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,320
networks and almost virtual networks

92
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,990
they instantiate different compute

93
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,380
resource or storage resource so that's

94
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,390
how the virtual private cloud being

95
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,200
differentiated from the virtual network

96
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:28,890
itself it's including the compute and

97
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,760
also many times virtual functions as

98
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:37,590
well for the problem itself

99
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,930
we ended the clarification multiple

100
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:44,010
different ways a workload can be

101
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:51,560
connected and many cloud datacenters

102
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:54,630
today offers internet a gateway allow

103
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,830
users to connect to the workflow through

104
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:02,280
the internet another way is like a

105
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,859
virtual gateway or IPSec gateway so

106
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,520
though allow them to connect to their

107
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,830
work go through secure Channel then

108
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,830
another option could be the recollect

109
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,349
they could have physical infrastructures

110
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,260
or physical path they purchased from

111
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:23,460
provider provide network to connect to

112
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:26,159
the customer gateway so as from workload

113
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,729
perspective they could just being

114
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,060
connected by different methods so one of

115
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,520
the problems encountered by many

116
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,859
enterprises is to be able to figure out

117
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,549
how this workload actually is connected

118
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,700
if I'm connected through IP sac or if

119
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,319
I'm connected through the Gateway so the

120
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,480
they would like to see different

121
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
basically have some kind of visibility

122
00:08:50,940 --> 00:09:00,990
the workload perspective also that we

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,810
also added details on the for the

124
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,600
Gateway itself it will advertise all the

125
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,760
prefix for this particular client of

126
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,220
particular tenant but the actual

127
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,779
workload itself may be actually located

128
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:19,650
in different locations from cloudiness

129
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:22,200
and the perspective is Oh like lumped

130
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,500
together as all the reachable through

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,810
this particular gateway or through

132
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:34,470
multiple gateways so that's another

133
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:37,890
problem from routing perspective so for

134
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:41,250
the gap analysis we have lots of

135
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:44,699
discussions on the mailing list in

136
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:48,330
particularly is about the gap analysis

137
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,330
to the tunneling cab common cab this

138
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,940
particular job has been out in IDR for

139
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:58,080
many years there are some confusions

140
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:03,390
into it in particular what do you mean

141
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:06,150
by remote endpoint so the tunnel in cap

142
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:09,330
itself is really - for router to

143
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,829
advertise their encapsulation

144
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,520
capabilities right so in this example

145
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:18,610
you could have

146
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,610
[Music]

147
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:42,359
so for example prefix 10.1.1.1 fix or be

148
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:45,389
line number three

149
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:47,579
PennDOT one thought X have the

150
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:51,209
encapsulation of gie

151
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:55,618
and villain number three can be

152
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:59,039
encapsulated by the enemy to be

153
00:10:55,619 --> 00:11:01,979
excellent and then it advertised to all

154
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,999
the peers so when our three receiver

155
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:10,019
prefix to route to 10.1 they know that

156
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:13,319
oh I can't use this particular gie

157
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,909
encapsulation so the confusion part lots

158
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,858
of discussion on the mailing list and

159
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:20,069
just give us some up it's about the

160
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:22,649
remote end point the remote end point to

161
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:25,289
people who are familiar with who wrote

162
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:28,859
the draft is very clear to them but to

163
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:31,829
many people is kind of confusing is real

164
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:34,769
especially for our one perspective well

165
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:37,738
he sent out the update the remote end

166
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,769
point is actually himself and for the

167
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:43,769
receiver they see the remote endpoint

168
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:48,539
McCandless R one and another confusion

169
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:52,289
part was some esta a note themself a

170
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:56,159
third party can send on behalf of r1 so

171
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:58,999
like a controller they want to notify

172
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:03,179
all the relevant parties of

173
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:05,759
encapsulation capability to r1 they can

174
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:10,279
use the remote end point to indicate it

175
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:14,399
is actually our one is where the

176
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:19,009
encapsulation destination should be so

177
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:23,419
with that being cleared out and the gaps

178
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:29,489
need to the the one point management

179
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:33,619
because as you see that the EB piano or

180
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:37,019
any VPN is all about the client routes

181
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:39,929
distributions and for the one port is

182
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,500
connected to the provider network so

183
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:46,530
it's less of a concern

184
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:49,780
but for SD one is different for SD one

185
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,839
the one point could facing different

186
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,120
ISPs facing internet facing trusted

187
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,030
network or facing untrusted Network and

188
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,960
the one point if it's in the cloud it

189
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:04,780
could be a private address could facing

190
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:09,070
the net could facing different gateways

191
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:13,150
so all those web properties need to be

192
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:16,410
propagated to the remote peers and the

193
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:21,430
peers can be in different countries

194
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:23,230
different continents so and also the the

195
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,140
route reflect themselves on the

196
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,010
controller themselves can only be

197
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:32,860
reached through untrusted Network so

198
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:35,020
that part has to be making it clear but

199
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,830
very different than the tunneling cab

200
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:41,500
and that property on the web port

201
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,610
management that's not in the tunneling

202
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,080
cab

203
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:50,110
in the past many of the vendors

204
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:54,820
deploying sd1 have been using modified

205
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,480
and HRP to basically advertise to the

206
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,940
peers

207
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:03,190
what kind of one port address they have

208
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:06,940
what kind of like a net functional

209
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:09,610
support but for some of the large

210
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:14,640
deployment and HRP just doesn't scale

211
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:17,740
well and another thing is about

212
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,760
attachment so attachment can change and

213
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:25,690
some of the IPSec tunnels the one port

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,930
on change so that something has to be

215
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,930
addressed

216
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:38,829
we also clarify this security BPM CQ v

217
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:43,480
PM has done a good job to basically set

218
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:46,900
set up the IPSec tunnels between like a

219
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:50,920
node in shopping mall on node in cloud

220
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:55,120
data center where that is not directly

221
00:14:50,920 --> 00:15:01,420
connected or directly attached to the

222
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:04,720
provider McKeon's PE so that IPSec

223
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:09,240
tunnels can be established at different

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:14,500
Claire different granularities the

225
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:22,660
secure VPN can set up secure tunnel / /

226
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:25,960
PE / villain or / IPA opera tenant so

227
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:29,170
with that a draft a compare is really

228
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,890
for the st1 part some of the sd1

229
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:37,300
deployment allow they call so-called

230
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:41,069
internet dropout so meaning that your is

231
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,479
a connect to provide a VPN as a today's

232
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:48,790
enterprise you connect to the provider

233
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:53,650
VPN and and you want to expand your

234
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:56,260
capacity you create an Internet port so

235
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,380
through the internet port you can bypass

236
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:03,250
some of the traffic either secured or

237
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:06,550
not secured and the decision is really

238
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:10,060
the local decision from the CPS

239
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:16,060
perspective some traffic had to go to

240
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:19,239
the VPN sick is SLA and some traffic can

241
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,609
go through the the public Internet and

242
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,100
this can change depending on the network

243
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,210
performance and most of the sd1

244
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,370
deployment have this traffic monitoring

245
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:35,140
based on different applications and they

246
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:41,670
adjust the policies on the wrong time

247
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:45,760
another characteristics of the st1 is

248
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:48,729
location of proximity requirement some

249
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:54,580
of the deployment requires some traffic

250
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:58,000
have to traverse certain locations maybe

251
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:01,560
they have specific functions need to

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,089
perform maybe is the racket or e

253
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:09,579
requirement so that has to be required

254
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:15,458
and in some of the deployment you could

255
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:18,908
have cluster of sty Nationals and from

256
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:23,110
the policy perspective could be has to

257
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:26,350
go through a set of the sd1 edge notes

258
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:28,928
either one of them so there's some which

259
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,080
I call it ducks excuse me um could you

260
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:34,840
wrap up the discussion of the update to

261
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,610
the documents because I wanted to leave

262
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,908
a little time to discuss the documents

263
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:43,870
and how to progress them okay so this is

264
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:47,409
talking about the that the the additions

265
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:51,370
to the gap analysis I think this is my

266
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:52,390
last slide this one I don't have to talk

267
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,399
so that's it

268
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:59,460
actually that was my last slide of the

269
00:17:54,399 --> 00:18:03,610
gap additions to the update okay thanks

270
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:06,270
so I had I provided a lot of feedback

271
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:11,678
specifically on the problem statement

272
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:13,690
document and I think Jeff and I are of

273
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,230
the opinion that just focusing on that

274
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:23,260
document that it still it still needs a

275
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:24,940
lot of work in terms of you know clarity

276
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,950
it draws a lot of interesting

277
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,380
conclusions but the means by which it

278
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,899
arrives at that conclusion are kind of

279
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,809
unclear but I also had a question

280
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:37,658
looking at this on the the fact that you

281
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,850
have two documents here is there any

282
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:44,080
possibility to combine these two

283
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:46,840
documents yeah this absolutely possible

284
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,520
because I mean in general we in a

285
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,010
working group we see a certain amount of

286
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,389
work to publish a document but once it

287
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,770
leaves a working group once you do

288
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,750
working group last call and request

289
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:59,820
publication there's a huge amount of

290
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:03,370
work that goes on by the ad and the iesg

291
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,200
and so just the fact of having two

292
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,760
documents if they could really be one

293
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:14,429
document might help that that aspect

294
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:18,860
quite a bit no problem

295
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:25,790
yes Sally a Lisa justice Cisco

296
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:30,139
I like to basically with respect to this

297
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:34,720
draft some of the point that you making

298
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,720
it as gap and needs clarification

299
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:44,000
my concern is those points when somebody

300
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,980
reads the draft and the tunneling

301
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,340
capture app for example in its entirety

302
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:53,090
not just one portion of it just read the

303
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,730
whole draft they are clear I mean I

304
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,159
didn't find any ambiguity in there and

305
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,880
there are several places that they

306
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,940
provide the example one one thing like a

307
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,850
remote endpoint but at the remote end

308
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:11,480
point what it is I mean even if the

309
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,879
language is ambiguous the example that

310
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,100
it provides after somebody reads through

311
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:21,110
the example it makes it clear what it is

312
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:24,919
and even after that if the example is

313
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:27,409
not clear then I will say we need to let

314
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:32,270
the author know - you know clarify that

315
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:34,700
example I don't see why we need to get

316
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:37,580
that clarification done in another job

317
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,130
oh no no no actually this is just a

318
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:44,810
little bit update on the email

319
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,520
discussions that clarification is clear

320
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,940
it's not in this draft

321
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,680
okay just I'm just me myself because

322
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,960
going through lots of discussion I want

323
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,570
to update the group with some

324
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:01,070
clarification so the main thing is

325
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:04,490
really the that gap itself in a document

326
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,980
is just to talk about on the one point

327
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,260
because sd1 when port can facing

328
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,190
different ink networks so that's that

329
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:15,140
the can then even the you know if we

330
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,460
trying to say there is a gap Frank

331
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,700
though I'm not sure there is a gap

332
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,640
because you go through the tunneling cap

333
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,830
it provides tons of flexibility I mean

334
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,130
you can do the Vanport that you're

335
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,560
talking about tunneling cap allows for

336
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,690
sending the encapsulation over the van

337
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,000
port and the van port can be

338
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,400
public or you can deprive it and then it

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,170
allows for the recursive resolution of

340
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:45,770
the VPN addresses into the van port and

341
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:49,100
so that you don't have to send the

342
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:51,230
tunnel attribute with every VPN that's

343
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,659
one way of doing it another way that it

344
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,750
allows you to do that is using coloring

345
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,240
it says you can send the van port with

346
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:03,050
the tunnel and cab attribute calorie and

347
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,600
then every VPN address you send as long

348
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,790
as it has the same color it's going to

349
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,550
resolve into the same encapsulation

350
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:13,580
so on could you make this comment on the

351
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:19,370
list specifically regarding this

352
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:21,199
document with respect to in this working

353
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,719
group with respect to this document I

354
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,910
think you're arguing that this document

355
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,510
is not actually needed so let me ask

356
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:32,180
Linda the question the email thread that

357
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,680
you have which I responded to I don't

358
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,600
recall whether it was this working group

359
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,100
or another working group which working

360
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:43,370
group was it - if it was this working

361
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,939
girl music already responded so actually

362
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,860
um tunnel in cap itself it would be

363
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,470
great you can point it out we have lots

364
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,860
of discussion on the mailing list

365
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,600
however it didn't address about the one

366
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,679
port property when talking about a 1

367
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,379
port property

368
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,060
it's not about encapsulation it's not

369
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:08,870
about the the client route distribution

370
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:12,010
so the section you mentioned about

371
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:15,139
recursive and about all those sections

372
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:28,670
we have a comment from the ID our chair

373
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:33,950
I believe on this I think that you may

374
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:39,680
have context difference I think that

375
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:41,240
it's possible to - including it's

376
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,260
possible to do what you're just saying

377
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,490
right but the secure VPN draft which may

378
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,190
not be the right kind

379
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:52,670
export that was what I took does not

380
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,590
have it in it it's it's it's it's and I

381
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:57,380
think that's what you and Linda are at

382
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,090
opposite side done let's just saying

383
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,170
it's not specified someplace you're

384
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,809
saying it's possible

385
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:05,870
thumbs up to both we just need to put it

386
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:08,300
someplace and decide where it's gonna go

387
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,850
I don't know and I will turn to the best

388
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:15,159
chairs with where it goes so I'm closing

389
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:20,350
the lines and let's move on to Martin

390
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:23,780
Linda Martin speaking as routing ad

391
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,809
Linda I'm under the impression that the

392
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,399
objectives these two documents was to

393
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,580
figure our discussion on the missing

394
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,390
pieces two caps and so on right can you

395
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,820
see that again so we wanted to have a

396
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:41,440
discussion on what you feel is missing

397
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:44,840
to achieve what you want to do yes

398
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,000
looking at what's happening now looking

399
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:51,080
at the different lists I believe they

400
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,720
are extensive discussions on the

401
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:57,230
different building blocks that you want

402
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,679
there are discussions yes it's a

403
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,929
question to the group I'm wondering

404
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,920
whether now that the discussions are

405
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:13,820
happening - we need to publish these two

406
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:18,130
documents oh I don't know that yeah I

407
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:22,520
don't expect an answer from you okay

408
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:24,890
okay okay so the document is to document

409
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:29,660
the problem statements problems issues

410
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:33,230
and for myself I think is invaluable

411
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:35,840
as a history about getting the together

412
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:39,590
discussion on the problems and what is

413
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,080
missing and as Chris was saying that we

414
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,689
need more people to put into the

415
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,559
problems actually I was hoping to reach

416
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:51,410
out to some cloud providers to actually

417
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,290
go through the document and maybe adding

418
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,900
more to clarify them I think it will be

419
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,909
valuable for the community to have this

420
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,140
document whether you publish a not

421
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,670
publish but I think

422
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:06,710
to have that in terms of gap analysis

423
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:10,070
some of the gaps the gaps identified of

424
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:13,340
course the trust where the tunnel in-cab

425
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:16,100
or secure VPN can be enhanced to address

426
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,570
those gaps then if they do that's great

427
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,570
that's served the purpose of this

428
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:24,889
document right so but I think the

429
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:27,889
problems is is valuable I personally

430
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,780
thank you I think Ally I might be able

431
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:34,640
to provide some perspective on this as

432
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:37,190
well sure so I think that having a

433
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,830
problem statement document that looks at

434
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,860
the hybrid cloud connectivity is

435
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:47,000
extremely valuable and this document

436
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,820
does a lot of those pieces if the gap

437
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,060
analysis and it's very useful to have us

438
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,830
actually thinking and discussing SEO and

439
00:26:53,060 --> 00:27:00,020
some of these other constructs that are

440
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:03,139
very commonly used I'm not sure if a gap

441
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,240
analysis is the right endpoint for

442
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,920
something to publish it might be that it

443
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,570
transforms instead for being a gap

444
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:14,110
analysis that sparks discussion into a

445
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:16,669
recipe book yeah that would be useful

446
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:19,639
that's what I had in mind but the recipe

447
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:23,300
book would be would come afterwards yes

448
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:28,310
when you have all the ingredients Thank

449
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:30,740
You Ali dear Patel arcus speaking as an

450
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:33,169
co-author for tunneling katstra I just

451
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,790
wanted to let you know that refresh is

452
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,440
being made as we speak it's going to be

453
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,220
submitted version 13 stone it's

454
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,540
submitted today

455
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:44,660
I completely agree with Ali that from a

456
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,340
solution perspective everything is in

457
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,920
there but if you feel something's

458
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,449
missing

459
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,220
feel free to send a note to either idea

460
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,870
or routing working group if you are

461
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,850
discussing these documents in routing

462
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,219
working group actually a note for

463
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,020
working with chair to make sure that you

464
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,450
cross-reference or make sure that they

465
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,800
cross-reference idea in it because the

466
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,410
real work for the standardization

467
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,409
happens in idea thank you thank you

468
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:12,350
actually for the searching I don't know

469
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,270
if you have published or not oh good no

470
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,740
buts let's just let the

471
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,510
the people that the Mike had their say

472
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,240
and then we'll take the discussion on

473
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:22,850
the list this is this is an idea moment

474
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,040
that may hope the cheers we will be

475
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:28,909
discussing these straps in an idear

476
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,190
session on Wednesday from 1332 1530

477
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:39,820
during that time I will give an overview

478
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:42,380
of the secure VPN and Ali Ali and June

479
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:45,020
remotely will will be discussing it

480
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:49,820
maybe you want to move some of the

481
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:51,850
technical stuff over the IDR with ok

482
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,290
quickly one last comment I'm very quick

483
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:57,949
basically in terms of the gap analysis

484
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,170
as long as the gap is a real gap that is

485
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,350
perfectly fine to capturing the document

486
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,660
but if it is misunderstanding it is not

487
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:09,909
a place to put it in the document thank

488
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:13,240
you thank you thank you very much and

489
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:18,580
Stuart Bryant is up next to talk about

490
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,580
preferred path loop-free alternates

491
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,310
so if I accidentally say path preference

492
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,260
routing it's because I keep mixing the

493
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:37,879
two up it's really called preferred path

494
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:40,190
routing so let me start by giving a

495
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,060
quick overview some of you may have seen

496
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:46,820
this work token about in LSR but not

497
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:50,330
everyone so PPR provides a method of

498
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,750
injecting paths into a specific arts

499
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:56,270
into a link state IGP in the data plane

500
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:59,450
the packet is back to its intended path

501
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:00,920
by its PPR ID so it's an identifier on

502
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,510
the planter front of the packet that

503
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,220
says what the path is and then it's up

504
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:09,290
to the forwarders pp the PPR ID is a

505
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,050
single identifier that's put in the

506
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:14,930
packet so it's just the name of the path

507
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:18,500
and the format will be data plane

508
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:20,780
specific so this is a technology that

509
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,020
can support ipv6 addresses ipv4

510
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,940
addresses MPLS labels and also if you

511
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,190
want to MAC addresses if you want to

512
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,170
apply this technology for example to

513
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:34,540
trill or link state bridging or

514
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:38,150
something there was an interrupt for PBR

515
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:40,730
yesterday at the hackathon so how does

516
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,460
it work say I want to send a packet from

517
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:47,660
A to B to C to D that's not the shortest

518
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:50,420
path what I do in the control plane is

519
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,120
to inject a data structure that says

520
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,430
this is the people you are ID and here

521
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:01,070
is here here is the path I wanted to

522
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:03,560
follow ABCD in the data plane the only

523
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:06,560
thing that goes on the packet is the PBR

524
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,379
I did and that's true no matter how

525
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:15,800
complex the path so let's look at how we

526
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:17,870
apply this to fast reroute so first off

527
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:21,950
I'm going to consider a simple basic

528
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:25,489
link repair I've got the this sub

529
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:29,090
technology here a b c d is the prover is

530
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,550
the path i want to go and i need to deal

531
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:34,669
with an incidence of the breakage of the

532
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:38,480
length of bc so the first thing i do is

533
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:42,109
to assign a PPR ID to this repair

534
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,820
or call that C Prime and then I set up

535
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:46,519
the path that I want the packet to

536
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:50,389
follow if it bc failures the path is

537
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:54,710
going to be from B to e to F to G and

538
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:57,049
then on to C note that this could be any

539
00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:00,230
arbitrary path that I wish to construct

540
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:03,168
for any policy reason that I wish to

541
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:08,200
construct it so what they do is I in cap

542
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:12,470
the packet to C Prime and I push it from

543
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,809
B to E and started on its journey and it

544
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:18,590
will follow the repair required repair

545
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:20,389
path now could of course terminate this

546
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,779
repair path early I could drop the

547
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:27,350
packet off in queue space so we consider

548
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:28,909
the little little sub topology below I'm

549
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:33,889
going to release the packet at F Prime

550
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:38,210
the path graph Prime is from B to E and

551
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:39,738
then F the PLR is of course be still and

552
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm just going to encounter the packet

553
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:48,440
to F now there's all what you also have

554
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,418
to think in terms of a fast reroute

555
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,580
approach what you're going to do when

556
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:58,429
the packet arrives at the fast reroute

557
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,580
destination so if it's like an IP packet

558
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:03,259
an SR v6 packet or a Maki Mak packet

559
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,799
it's all pretty easy you just take away

560
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:10,369
the outer encapsulation on you go if

561
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:13,029
it's MPLS classic then we have the usual

562
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:18,350
next next hop label problem to deal with

563
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:24,049
but if we use a model similar to MPLS ax

564
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:26,928
SR where we have a well-known compact

565
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:29,149
label space that is associated with the

566
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:32,450
nodes life becomes a lot easier because

567
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:34,758
you can figure out what the correction

568
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:37,340
needs to be so we don't need to do the

569
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:41,119
targeted LDP stuff but if we can adopt

570
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,830
that sort of approach note I'm thinking

571
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,178
of just using that to steer the packet

572
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:49,699
they're not a full-blown sr solution

573
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:51,260
node repair so this is well known you

574
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,900
have to treat a node repair

575
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:57,379
as K minus-1 separate failures you have

576
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:00,350
to also repair to the note itself in

577
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,630
case it was a link failure each of the

578
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,689
repairs can follow again any required

579
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:09,080
policy that you want it to follow and

580
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:13,040
you can have multiple repairs if from a

581
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:15,440
particular node if that is what the set

582
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,449
of policy wants for example you might

583
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,840
have to send some packets shortest delay

584
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:24,649
and other packets Louis loss for highest

585
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:28,540
bandwidth so now let's think about

586
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:32,659
traffic engineering so in this little

587
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:37,190
sub topology I have a traffic engineered

588
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:38,570
path ABCD and that's where my primary

589
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:44,149
path is and I create a traffic

590
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:47,060
engineered backup path a efg today and

591
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,940
what I do is I construct some connectors

592
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,909
from the traffic engineer from from the

593
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,950
main traffic engineer path to the repair

594
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,050
traffic engineered path so I can join

595
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,700
that part that a number of stages and

596
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,540
the reason I do that is that it

597
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,460
minimizes the amount of paths I have to

598
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,609
inject into the network and minimizes

599
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:12,260
the calculation so in this particular

600
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:14,779
case if any of a b b c or c d fails then

601
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,770
i have a short path that takes me into a

602
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,030
traffic engineer backup path and i what

603
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:24,640
the sort of traffic i would want to put

604
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:29,540
on this is traffic with a critical SLA

605
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:32,589
that must use fr are for example altra

606
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:37,759
low latency or up to reliable traffic or

607
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:39,560
some IOT slice or high bandwidth traffic

608
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,440
that i don't want to go near the best

609
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:47,750
effort because it's going to damage my

610
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:50,780
normal traffic so we can make this a bit

611
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:53,920
easier so there's a draft that's also in

612
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:58,490
LSR that describes the construction of

613
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:02,119
PPR grants and what happens here is that

614
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:04,279
the the T Ovie's describe a graph as a

615
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,820
series of lists of

616
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,830
and the anode can't figure out where it

617
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,710
is in this graph and forward the packet

618
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:16,549
accordingly in the graph any note may be

619
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:18,590
a source but we have to note that a

620
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:22,700
graph that a node is a potential source

621
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:26,210
with the S bit mechanism and there isn't

622
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:28,299
in the PLF alien solution there is just

623
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,840
one destination which has the D bit set

624
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,400
and the D bit has that node has a PBR ID

625
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,830
associated with it so we're going to

626
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,940
build basically a series of trees and

627
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:43,490
we'll see the use of that in a moment

628
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:45,560
so let's look at our simple graph we've

629
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,359
seen this topology before the key

630
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,750
difference is that the repair is

631
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:54,259
constructed as a single graph so the

632
00:36:50,750 --> 00:37:00,020
graph with the PPR ID of D Prime

633
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:03,410
has got three sub-links in if you like

634
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:10,339
or three sub paths in it the one a the

635
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:14,868
one EF g d and then the one a the 1 B 2

636
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:17,270
F and the one C 2 G notice that all the

637
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:19,880
sources are marked with the s bit in the

638
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:24,530
PPR syntax and there is only one

639
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:26,869
destination which is d prime so we do

640
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:30,680
exactly what we did before if any of the

641
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:33,020
paths a b b c or c d fail we inject the

642
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:37,040
part of the packet into the PPR graph

643
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:39,410
and it will arrive at D Prime and this

644
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,359
is useful both in the traffic engineer

645
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,460
case and actually in the best effort

646
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,690
case because it it produces a more

647
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:52,119
compact representation of the of the

648
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:56,390
repair and that we'll see in a moment so

649
00:37:52,119 --> 00:38:00,050
Ilia may recognize this graph this is

650
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:02,629
from RFC 7812 and i'm going to look at

651
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:05,660
how we would construct a maximally

652
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,400
redundant tree using this technology so

653
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:13,670
if you recall a maximally redundant tree

654
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:14,690
is a method of getting a packet through

655
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,580
a repair

656
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,070
where you're going to do your best shot

657
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,330
at having two paths which are redundant

658
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,680
but if you can't find two fully

659
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:24,440
redundant ones you don't care that's the

660
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,120
best you can do so look at the two

661
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,760
connected graph here we carry out

662
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:32,089
construct the red tree out of a PPR

663
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:35,620
graph and we construct the blue tree and

664
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:40,010
you'll notice that for any failure the

665
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:45,310
graph constructs a path that one of the

666
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:45,310
two paths will get to the destination

667
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:51,470
but notice that with PPR we can

668
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:54,290
construct a graph using any algorithm we

669
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:57,770
want and we're not constrained to having

670
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:01,460
a uniform algorithm across the the

671
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:04,850
network which was one of the constraints

672
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:08,780
of the MRT approach and so we can

673
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:11,870
actually construct easily multiple paths

674
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,280
each according to policy and have

675
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:18,290
multiple repairs each with its own color

676
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,720
now there's a much richer set of

677
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:23,270
approaches particularly when we're

678
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,450
moving into the world where we need to

679
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:32,960
worry about loss minimization and delay

680
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:37,759
minimization and slices etc so let's

681
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,680
look at another figure from the MRT RFC

682
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,620
so this deals with the case where there

683
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:49,190
is a constraint that C and G and the

684
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:54,620
link between C and G are a single point

685
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:56,930
of failure and we can obviously what we

686
00:39:54,620 --> 00:40:01,400
can by demonstration here

687
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:05,120
construct the MRT pair subject to the

688
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:08,600
SPF constraint but nonetheless we can

689
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:12,069
construct it using whatever policy we

690
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,069
wish to apply to construct the graph

691
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,840
okay so the next thing is we need to

692
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,850
consider whether we're going to do this

693
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,650
centrally or D centrally or

694
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,540
decentralized and the answer is we can

695
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:27,920
do both and we can do whatever suits our

696
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:30,410
problem in the approach any node can

697
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,440
inject the PPR path so that can be

698
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:36,440
either the PLR itself creating its own

699
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,910
repair paths or it can be an SDN

700
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:45,050
controller on behalf of the network

701
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:46,970
constructing managed repairs multiple

702
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,670
nodes can inject the repair for

703
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:53,390
redundancy so I can multiply connect and

704
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:55,580
then the IGP flooding mechanism will

705
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,950
strip the duplicates and make sure that

706
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:00,319
any that providing one copy gets into

707
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,000
the network the repair gets to all the

708
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:06,860
no repair information gets the blue

709
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,950
nodes it needs to get to with this

710
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:13,190
approach we can use any algorithm for

711
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:15,230
any specific path that makes sense so

712
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,780
that's particularly attractive from it

713
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,910
in an SDN network where I may have some

714
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,230
really quite complex policies or a slice

715
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,879
network where I may have some quite

716
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,880
complex policies I wish wish to apply

717
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:31,280
PLA is of course independent of any

718
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:33,710
other repairing techniques so I can run

719
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,680
it ships in the night and use it but we

720
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,020
use it for specialist cases I can use it

721
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:43,419
in conjunction with classical LFA if I

722
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:45,980
want I can use it with any of the

723
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,990
approaches to do the thing that it's

724
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,130
really good at or I can just say well

725
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:53,180
why don't I just have one approach

726
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:57,770
because it will do it will find it has

727
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,990
the capability of finding a repair in

728
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:04,880
any joint in any network that's not in

729
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:09,680
our cut set as I mentioned earlier we

730
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,870
can apply it to multiple data planes the

731
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,279
usual ones NP s NP SS are IP

732
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:19,310
ipv4 ipv6 or Ethernet indeed I can apply

733
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,960
to any data plane in which the topology

734
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:24,470
is known by an entity capable of

735
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,060
calculating the repair paths and it

736
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,970
requires no additional data plane

737
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,670
services beyond the singles

738
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:34,279
capsulation and decapsulation of a

739
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:38,359
packet at the PLR and decapsulation at

740
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,550
the repair target so advantages supports

741
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:43,790
any data plane type the control plane is

742
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,410
just the IGP in use any repair can be

743
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:48,410
constructed with a single level of

744
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,569
packet encapsulation the repair can be

745
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:53,690
instructed to conform to any policy

746
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:55,670
whether this is post convergence the

747
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:59,840
post conversions path which is what TI

748
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:03,320
LFA is doing it can be a tea path or it

749
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,910
can be the policy of the traffic that is

750
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,950
being repaired which is something we

751
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,140
don't talk about very much because if

752
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:11,299
you put traffic into a network with a

753
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,160
certain policy you would really in my

754
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:17,840
view prefer to see the repair path

755
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,879
conform to that policy and it's the

756
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:26,680
consistency and loop checking is really

757
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:30,830
easy which removes a possible problem in

758
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:34,970
some of the techniques so still a lot

759
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:36,830
more to do and we are proposed to add

760
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,618
more to this work in the next

761
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:41,150
installment there is some IPR on this

762
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:43,430
which we will disclose at the earliest

763
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:53,859
opportunity so does anyone have any

764
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:56,450
questions ok thank you

765
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:59,270
we'll be closely watching progress of

766
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:02,390
main people are dressed in LS are in the

767
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:12,770
draft is relying on extensions behind

768
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:16,330
there so next up is laylee to talk about

769
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,330
protocol assisted protocol

770
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,529
[Music]

771
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,560
good morning everyone my name is Selena

772
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:35,169
comes from Hawaii and this morning's

773
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,890
presentation is the new protocol name

774
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:42,060
the PAP and this protocol is actually to

775
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:46,529
help the existing routing protocols to

776
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:51,310
that's more flexible and efficient

777
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:53,440
troubleshooting method ok so before I

778
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,580
introduce the detailed information about

779
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,830
the new protocol

780
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:59,770
I just want to let's talk about the

781
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:01,930
motivation why we needed to introduce a

782
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:05,680
new protocol for the troubleshooting of

783
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:07,120
the whole network actually in the in now

784
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,310
existing network a world

785
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,490
we already have many many measures to

786
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:15,580
troubleshooting one direction is for the

787
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:18,939
centralized troubleshooting such as we

788
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:21,610
can use Lib to connect some alarm

789
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,730
notification and so on to our

790
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:28,230
centralized the EMS or we can use

791
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:31,360
bianchi protocol to connect detailed BGP

792
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:33,880
routing protocol information to the

793
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,850
centralized Sdn controller and the EMS

794
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,850
our centralized controller connector all

795
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:41,890
this massive information it can analyze

796
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:44,350
the relationship hawke of this

797
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:49,120
information and to find the route fault

798
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:50,950
of the network so I can we can we can

799
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,430
see if you use the centralized the

800
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:56,799
troubleshooting we can see the the

801
00:45:53,430 --> 00:46:00,009
advantage is very clear is automatically

802
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,800
our operator just to sit here and to see

803
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:05,710
our EMS or as the in controller can can

804
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,750
know why we have some maybe the route

805
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,490
path selected wrong or maybe the

806
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,400
configuration is wrong or anything else

807
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:15,430
but it's automatically but the

808
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,310
disadvantages career also because we

809
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:21,390
won't you get this whole analyze result

810
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,570
we need massive information from the

811
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,240
equipment's

812
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:29,860
that means we can we need it connect to

813
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:32,620
all alarm all blocks all maybe protocol

814
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:35,470
informations from the ever equipment

815
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:39,040
that means we need extra

816
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:40,839
cost extra bandwidth cost extra

817
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,990
you know scipio cost of the equipment

818
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:49,119
and second very big the disadvantage is

819
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:52,240
actually the lack of the costume and

820
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,160
information this cross-domain not means

821
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,160
the a ass to me or anything else its

822
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,520
magnitude to man magnus even won't go to

823
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,649
the root fortune from the equipment we

824
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,290
need this equipments managed by our

825
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:08,109
centralized DMS or centralized eyes in

826
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:11,320
controller but we know the route from

827
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:15,369
which we've focus open for PGG actually

828
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:18,099
maybe the 14th note from our demand

829
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:22,270
maybe comes from other operators and so

830
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:24,040
on so if we just you centralized we

831
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:26,650
cannot get this information we cannot

832
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,200
get the route fault of this BGP is

833
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,690
passed the action so this is the

834
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,410
advantage and disadvantage with the

835
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:37,869
centralized troubleshooting method and

836
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:40,480
another direction is distribute to all

837
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:44,170
semi distribute troubleshooting methods

838
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,480
this method is not depends on the

839
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,720
centralized DMS or centralized as in

840
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,000
controller we just think if there have

841
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:56,230
some problems our engineer always

842
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,349
operate engineer will log in the node to

843
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:01,270
see ok what the meaning of the what a

844
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:03,760
matter with the routing table or

845
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:06,070
something else if this routing table

846
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,500
without any problems they will find

847
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,599
where the upstream did you pee speaker

848
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,150
or anything else to log into another

849
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,700
equipment to see also to see the alarm

850
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:18,130
the notification and the routing table

851
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:21,939
information and so on and one by one to

852
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:26,230
get the route fault so we can see this

853
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:29,710
distribution method is do not generally

854
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:31,390
act extra information extra messages to

855
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:34,240
the from the increment to the

856
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:38,020
centralized the EMS or or all controller

857
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:42,040
but we also need to very high experience

858
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:45,700
for the engineer to can find the trouble

859
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:49,180
one by one and to know how to get to

860
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:51,640
this upstream and Latin engineer

861
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:54,848
familiar with different route routing

862
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:57,970
protocols IDP BGP are apt and so on so

863
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:59,710
this and also the same challenge with

864
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,230
the centralized the troubleshooting

865
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:04,210
because he needed to log in this

866
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:07,030
increment that means the boundary of the

867
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,309
monument domain is also that is also a

868
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:12,579
challenger for the troubleshooting or

869
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:16,859
the route troubleshooting okay so for

870
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:19,780
for this - okay well for these

871
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:22,930
challenges we want to introduce a new

872
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:27,069
light protocol them the PAP protocol

873
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:29,640
assisted protocol this light protocol to

874
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:33,520
meet all these challenges to help our

875
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:37,029
operators to reduce the experience

876
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,339
requirement and to reduce the time a

877
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:42,819
troubleshooting time for the whole

878
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:45,279
network and this this new light protocol

879
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:47,800
I mean very light that means from this

880
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,470
protocol we will not be exchanging very

881
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,900
detailed information about the routing

882
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:56,470
protocol or about some alarm sense or

883
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:01,240
are we just too extreme you could change

884
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:03,520
the exactly why who in the problem who

885
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,919
make the problem just this information

886
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,259
exchanged by this protocol so the

887
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:13,930
information is very light the second

888
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:17,619
thing is we use this new route proto and

889
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:20,379
your PAP protocol to exchange between

890
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:22,750
the equipment's so we don't need

891
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:26,190
centralize the server to connect to the

892
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:28,750
informations so and they we don't need

893
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:31,480
massive information from the commander

894
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:34,150
to the centralized server but actually I

895
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:37,030
have said that it's a light protocol so

896
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:38,920
we need exchanger a little more

897
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:41,579
additional information but the data

898
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,079
information is not too much so the

899
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:46,690
bandwidth and the Scipio pressure of the

900
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,510
equipment is not too much not too much

901
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:52,930
extra cost and another thing is this

902
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:54,849
protocol is separated with the acidity

903
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,950
the porticoes that means the routing

904
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:59,109
protocol still there they didn't change

905
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:01,720
anything about the existing network

906
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:04,720
service protocol we just add

907
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,790
two separated brought over to just

908
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:12,310
change the troubleshooting so when we

909
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:16,000
troubleshooting women not impact also

910
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:18,430
it's not based on the engineer C

911
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,280
experience because it is automatically

912
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:24,910
totally automatically and this is the

913
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,310
merit of the new protocol so this is in

914
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:28,509
our draft in our draft where we gave a

915
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:31,660
to use cases

916
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:35,320
y is for beauty P another one is for SP

917
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:38,490
rsvp-te tonneau and actually we just

918
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:41,170
defined how to exchange the

919
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:46,240
troubleshooting information in BGP to

920
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:49,470
find the oxidation source and we defined

921
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,649
the use case to show how to help

922
00:51:49,470 --> 00:52:00,399
operators to get who is the whose link

923
00:51:53,650 --> 00:52:03,070
its failure in some RPG Talos and this

924
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,609
is some details about the PPS messages

925
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:10,060
encoding of the key messages and firstly

926
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:12,000
its new negotiation to to negotiate the

927
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:15,220
whether you can support or not and

928
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,260
request on the reply message to exchange

929
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:20,430
the troubleshooting information and the

930
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:24,430
notification the FAK is for the

931
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:27,009
additional of scenarios for some special

932
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:28,810
scenario to exchange the information so

933
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,300
the main process and the men's messages

934
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:35,799
is negotiation and request to reprise

935
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:37,839
messages and we think for because this

936
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,060
for troubleshooting it's not like a

937
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:43,480
routing protocol we needed soul very

938
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:47,589
high with reliability so we think the

939
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:52,300
UDP is enough we required the UDP port

940
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:56,140
in this draft messages and this is a

941
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:59,140
very brief operation to explain how this

942
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:01,359
PAP works but actually in last pages I

943
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:03,730
have explained first to you negotiate

944
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,380
whether you can speak whether you are up

945
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:08,290
here keep speaker and whether you can

946
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:10,510
receive answer this information and if

947
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:12,400
you're not if nobody know that we can

948
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:15,820
use our traditional troubleshooting

949
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:19,570
methods is no matter and for the data

950
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:22,630
personally I have chosen us to slice

951
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:25,990
because a requester who who's linked his

952
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:29,080
figure in this channel and then sent to

953
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:33,370
our PAP speaker if this PSP carry the

954
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,880
thought r3p know okay I am the I am the

955
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:36,130
fault

956
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,520
I have this fault and might increase

957
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:43,270
failure so I repeat he this module will

958
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:47,320
help your PAP and then help you answer

959
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:49,420
this request to the ingress equipment so

960
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,060
they see the requester on the reply

961
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:56,110
processor that means we just ask a

962
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:58,779
question and the PAP speaker will answer

963
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:59,850
the the fort note will answer this

964
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:03,930
question

965
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:08,700
so they see the basic operation

966
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:12,009
certainly we have some additional

967
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:14,669
operation scenarios so I don't want to

968
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:18,040
explain too much in this very brief

969
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:21,090
operation explain if you have

970
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:29,740
interesting into you can read our draft

971
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:34,360
ok so I'm very fast - because I okay yes

972
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:36,509
hi Greg nurse qzt I think that it would

973
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,670
be interesting and beneficial that

974
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:42,370
before addressing troubleshooting which

975
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:47,500
is a reaction to their failure detection

976
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:48,970
is that you discuss how the tailor's

977
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,210
being detected

978
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:55,870
because I understand that questioning

979
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:59,160
something from your peer neighbor or for

980
00:54:55,870 --> 00:55:05,200
upstream is driven by detecting abnormal

981
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:09,339
behavior so how this abnormal behavior

982
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:11,970
is detected and then what's done because

983
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:16,710
first we need to know that we have

984
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:20,560
either contact continuity problem or

985
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:22,990
quality degradation or some other

986
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,390
abnormal behavior that drives us to

987
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:27,950
conclude that there is situation in a

988
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:32,129
network that requires troubleshooting

989
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:35,069
okay so I think your question is how to

990
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:38,069
detect the forethought how to detect the

991
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:42,119
problem i I think the PAP is just a

992
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:45,299
protocol generic channel to each other

993
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:48,299
equipment to let them can exchange the

994
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:50,759
messages but how about this for the

995
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:53,339
detective is based on the traditional

996
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,160
existing protocol such as if beauty have

997
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:59,038
problems the PGP will know it and then

998
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,200
that means that the PGP hotel are PAP so

999
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,960
they say it's the ad the protocol that

1000
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,480
means PGP or how these PAP and then this

1001
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,329
key speaker will answer the question to

1002
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,000
the requester cagey speaker

1003
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:13,890
so this PAP pert over just eighty to

1004
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,200
connote they do not to do anything about

1005
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:18,960
the detective or anything about analyze

1006
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:22,200
the chance to give the channel to help

1007
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,640
different massive different protocols

1008
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,819
can exchange the troubleshooting

1009
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,609
information from our protocol it's like

1010
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:38,009
that so it's we don't touch anything

1011
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:40,259
about the detective yeah jeff has the

1012
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:41,690
primary observation I'm going to make is

1013
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,579
that you're trying to troubleshoot

1014
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:46,890
various protocols and the type of things

1015
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:50,400
that you'll be troubleshooting each of

1016
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:54,598
those protocols will vary based on those

1017
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:58,140
protocols what I'm going to suggest is

1018
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:59,579
rather than inventing a new mechanism to

1019
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:03,390
try to actually troubleshoot these

1020
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:06,089
things I would suggest instead that this

1021
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:08,069
type of information belongs in something

1022
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,410
like the ITF yang model for that

1023
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:13,170
protocol or an augmentation for it

1024
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:16,259
something that actually already contains

1025
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:19,859
state relating to that protocol itself

1026
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:23,369
and that existing ITF mechanisms like

1027
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:27,150
rest comp or maybe Vegeta am i carrying

1028
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:30,180
these types of things is a better fit so

1029
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:32,609
I agree this is a nice problem to work

1030
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:36,859
on I would suggest working on it and

1031
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:36,859
existing models that we have

1032
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:48,430
sorry bitch because it's a little long

1033
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:53,560
if you like it I will take my here

1034
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:56,740
touched into the mailing list okay yeah

1035
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:59,799
lo Anderson first question to you and

1036
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:04,839
Chris I haven't read the draft am I

1037
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:06,730
allowed to off press in any way sure

1038
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:11,170
okay thank you can you give back the

1039
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:14,339
slides to where it says path and then

1040
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:20,760
expanded within parentheses that one

1041
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:24,869
yeah now previous one that one back

1042
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:28,900
it says path and then parentheses

1043
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:37,510
protocol assisted protocol that's top

1044
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:41,079
top so first I'm not sure that it's a

1045
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:43,930
merit to actually add more network-wide

1046
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:47,200
data to each and every node that

1047
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:51,549
probably needs to be discussed but my

1048
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,799
question is rather on is that that

1049
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:57,970
you're doing that is that what actually

1050
00:58:53,800 --> 00:59:01,660
enables you to not rely on a centralized

1051
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:04,180
server so the fact that you actually

1052
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:08,069
spread out network white data in the

1053
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:10,930
network is that what actually enables

1054
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:17,290
that you're not relying on one

1055
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:20,049
centralized controller okay I can go

1056
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:26,890
back to the list on that one I have a

1057
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:30,760
but if it is so not relying on the

1058
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:33,578
centralized controller is that actually

1059
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:39,010
excluding and centralized controller or

1060
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:40,869
is it a behavior in a in a state where

1061
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:45,490
tantalizing until they've no longer

1062
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:48,790
working for your particular device it's

1063
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:50,618
two different scenarios once you say we

1064
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,430
take the centralized controller out we

1065
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:55,599
don't want it

1066
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:58,450
or we have a mechanist that when we have

1067
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:01,210
a situation in the network when the

1068
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:03,939
centralized control is not working in

1069
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:05,920
the entire network a portal network we

1070
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:09,069
don't really like need to rely on you

1071
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:17,380
can hang go to the situation where it

1072
01:00:09,069 --> 01:00:20,109
actually comes back mr. Romeo ha ha way

1073
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:23,170
so they say we can either I seem at

1074
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:25,119
least commitment or centralized solution

1075
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:27,309
yeah I think that there isn't maybe the

1076
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,960
difference in scenario yeah because the

1077
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:31,569
way you think there's a centralized

1078
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,819
solution I have the benefit okay you

1079
01:00:31,569 --> 01:00:36,609
know that's the our the tradition of the

1080
01:00:33,819 --> 01:00:38,230
myth in maintenance they always are you

1081
01:00:36,609 --> 01:00:40,328
the say all right that's what other you

1082
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:42,549
know that's when the feeder having some

1083
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:48,400
duluth herb butter this video happens

1084
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:50,470
other okay and then I think I like this

1085
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,750
I want to I want to look at it a bit

1086
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:56,379
more before me I have one further

1087
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:59,589
question in BGP if you have oscillation

1088
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:03,880
do you actually know that you are the

1089
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:05,920
source probably a question for BGP

1090
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,470
people but you had an example think

1091
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,140
someone responds I am the oscillation

1092
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:13,959
source and I don't think we actually

1093
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:17,589
know we are just behaving at the total

1094
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:20,140
process I think because you know we have

1095
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:26,380
a future of all the beauty we can easily

1096
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:32,368
find some oscillate it because let's

1097
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:35,049
just do one less question here from I

1098
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:45,809
doesn't want to tell you did you know

1099
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:49,150
that yeah yeah so my question was

1100
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:52,270
regarding this PAP where you have given

1101
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:54,660
an example of oscillation right to

1102
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:59,799
identify an oscillation source

1103
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:02,618
how about detecting of black holes etc I

1104
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:04,540
mean when you cannot even forward the

1105
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:07,290
request to our neighboring router

1106
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:11,310
that was one question and the second was

1107
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:14,680
in this case also you need a centralized

1108
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:19,600
entity to initiate and to get that

1109
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:22,868
report I'm so sorry could you repeat

1110
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:27,609
your question because okay so why don't

1111
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:32,380
we take this and other questions to the

1112
01:02:27,609 --> 01:02:34,900
list dan has one really quick comment to

1113
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:38,680
make and then everything else is going

1114
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:40,480
to the list Dan Bogdanovic you're mixing

1115
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,839
some service level data with the device

1116
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:50,260
level and those two things are from a

1117
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:52,720
modeling perspective are incompatible so

1118
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:54,670
coming from my site it would be really

1119
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,339
good if you would would have taken

1120
01:02:54,670 --> 01:03:00,550
single use case and fully work it out

1121
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:02,200
for example the BGP example you would

1122
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:05,490
exchange information but you didn't

1123
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,490
describe what you would do with it

1124
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:16,810
actually the details in our draft to be

1125
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:18,820
what the drafted doesn't describe it's

1126
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:21,190
absolutely not clear because there's no

1127
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:29,280
intent workflow of how you would use the

1128
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:33,220
product because we already have some

1129
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:36,010
drops about this protocol it can work so

1130
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:37,720
maybe the draft is not very teach too

1131
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:39,400
much details about that we can refresh

1132
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:45,330
it it would be great thank you okay

1133
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:48,609
thank you so next up is Donald Eastlake

1134
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:51,759
talking about control and user plane

1135
01:03:48,609 --> 01:03:54,819
separation for BMG and just to provide a

1136
01:03:51,760 --> 01:04:00,400
little bit of context for this

1137
01:03:54,820 --> 01:04:07,510
there was a bath at the last IETF the

1138
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:10,000
because both discussing how the IETF and

1139
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:13,180
the routing area should proceed in

1140
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,090
relation to this so this this is not a

1141
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:18,098
working group document but we have a

1142
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:22,720
pretty liberal policy and Archie

1143
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:26,289
WG about presentation so we're not say

1144
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:29,288
working on this but perhaps Martin would

1145
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:31,720
like to just provide an update on you

1146
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:37,299
know what the conclusion of the because

1147
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:39,879
off at the last IETF was thank you Jeff

1148
01:04:37,299 --> 01:04:49,479
so Martin speaking I was planning to say

1149
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:53,109
that at the end no Jeff yeah my playing

1150
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:59,019
- what he's suggesting and he's laughing

1151
01:04:53,109 --> 01:05:01,930
because I'm calling him Jeff yeah I like

1152
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:03,999
to remind the book that this

1153
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:06,629
presentation doesn't change anything

1154
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:08,859
about the statement I made after

1155
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:13,289
consultation with the IES tree on the

1156
01:05:08,859 --> 01:05:18,249
because list which basically says that

1157
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:20,589
until we hear back from BBF who's

1158
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:24,488
working on requirements and possibly

1159
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:28,930
solutions for in that space that there

1160
01:05:24,489 --> 01:05:31,690
should be no work to progress in the

1161
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:42,460
IETF stream and that decision still

1162
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:45,160
holds thank you David thank you this is

1163
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:47,920
Dave Schoeneck rope I'm speaking is IETF

1164
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,779
liaison manager to BBF I came after

1165
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,700
Donald's presentation I can give the

1166
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:55,059
group a brief update on the progress in

1167
01:05:51,700 --> 01:06:00,129
the program one that would be good

1168
01:05:55,059 --> 01:06:02,890
thanks ok so this is intended to be a

1169
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:05,799
quick simple presentation mr. an update

1170
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:08,710
on the status of the draft is draft name

1171
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:11,079
is given here i'm donald Eastlake from

1172
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:15,670
future way and these are the other

1173
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:17,259
authors of this draft so purposes I did

1174
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:19,119
give a gonna give a brief background

1175
01:06:17,259 --> 01:06:22,359
this in case of people who aren't aware

1176
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,489
of that and talked about very briefly on

1177
01:06:22,359 --> 01:06:27,098
the relevant architecture would yes cus

1178
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:29,499
protocol is about and messages it has

1179
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:31,000
and mostly talk about it up date on the

1180
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:34,419
status of that draft

1181
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,119
s cusps stands for simple control plane

1182
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:40,869
and user plane separation protocol and

1183
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:43,089
I'll explain what that means so the idea

1184
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:45,310
is you have a broadband network gateway

1185
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:47,290
which is providing connection between

1186
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:50,078
customer equipment and the internet

1187
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:51,640
usually so that's authentication and

1188
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,859
accounting and all kinds of stuff like

1189
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,750
that and this is very much focused on

1190
01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:58,509
the fixed network rather than mobile

1191
01:06:55,750 --> 01:07:00,730
network so I'm not talking about cell

1192
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:02,890
phones talking to cell towers but more

1193
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:06,700
like residences or businesses that have

1194
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:12,490
fixed network connections so this is a

1195
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:15,279
very very high-level generic but it's

1196
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:17,500
useful Yuval found to be able to

1197
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,599
separate in the control plane parts of

1198
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,900
this network gateway from the user plane

1199
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:25,210
and one of the common idea is that you

1200
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:28,900
can put the control plane in the cloud

1201
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:31,240
making it much more scalable and you can

1202
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:33,760
have the user plane which probably has

1203
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,709
the highest bandwidth with lots of bits

1204
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,060
flowing through they implement it in a

1205
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:39,790
more physical fashion but of course

1206
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:41,349
that's not actually a constraint there's

1207
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:43,119
no protocol reason why you can't have

1208
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,670
both of these be virtual wish that you

1209
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:49,119
had some customer equipment that had

1210
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:50,560
lower bandwidth or both be physical so

1211
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,540
this is you notice there's sort of these

1212
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,589
triple lines between the control and

1213
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:59,440
user plane here this is a kind of a more

1214
01:07:55,589 --> 01:08:01,810
detailed explosion here with the dotted

1215
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,900
line across the center being the control

1216
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:08,560
plane and user plane separation boundary

1217
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:10,750
and those triple liner because most

1218
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:14,740
people have looked at this see there

1219
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:17,439
being as three interfaces a management

1220
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:19,028
interface we're using that confiden

1221
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:22,198
service interface which is kind of

1222
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:25,719
encapsulation of some itraq particular

1223
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:28,269
control service initiation and control

1224
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:30,549
stuff doing from the customer equipment

1225
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,960
and then this control interface which is

1226
01:08:30,549 --> 01:08:38,380
what we're talking about

1227
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:40,259
might need a a new protocol so ask us

1228
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,640
was a lightweight extensible protocol

1229
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:44,529
design support this control interface

1230
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,810
for fixed networks

1231
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:48,850
focused on that runs over TCP it's

1232
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:51,489
currently in production use at over a

1233
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:52,980
hundred thousand customers and next year

1234
01:08:51,488 --> 01:08:55,629
expected to be more than a million

1235
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:58,209
customers actually using this protocol

1236
01:08:55,630 --> 01:09:00,549
and as has been mentioned there was a

1237
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:02,770
because barf at IETF 104

1238
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:04,479
so the IETF is currently awaiting

1239
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:07,000
further input from the broadband forum

1240
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:09,849
and a number of liaisons have been

1241
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,380
exchanged you look in the liaison

1242
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:14,770
database to see that out of order if you

1243
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,210
go back to the previous presentations

1244
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:17,850
that have made early right you have some

1245
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:20,649
of those have pointers to the liaisons

1246
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:23,589
so I guess we're anticipating the ova

1247
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:26,858
feature liaison from the broadband forum

1248
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:30,399
and not expect that there'll be any IETF

1249
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:32,620
work until happens so what is that the

1250
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:35,710
change the the new version is - oh six

1251
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:39,370
of this protocol it's a lot more

1252
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:41,920
detailed it's up from 7,200 27 pages

1253
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:45,278
that's a 81% increase in the number of

1254
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,620
pages it's more thorough and it's closer

1255
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,630
to the deployed implementations that

1256
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:53,229
these are actually in daily use by real

1257
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:54,400
customers there's been a reorganization

1258
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:56,980
of some of the material which I'll show

1259
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:00,000
briefly and the additional details

1260
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:02,349
include contents of the messages

1261
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,130
expressed in routing backus-naur form

1262
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:08,620
which is a an IETF a no exactly a

1263
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:11,710
standard but it's a Nydia specification

1264
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:14,110
for our BNF error fields in various

1265
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:15,550
messages have been detailed to greater

1266
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,349
extent what values can appear there

1267
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:19,840
there's a expanded Security's

1268
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:23,050
consideration section still not that

1269
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,670
perhaps super big but anyway in general

1270
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:27,219
it's a much better much more detailed

1271
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:29,590
draft so somebody who was interested in

1272
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:31,930
this protocol would recommend they look

1273
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:35,320
at this latest draft as though they'll

1274
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:37,660
learn a lot more here's how the core

1275
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,910
specification material was reorganized

1276
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:41,380
you can see some things that were

1277
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:44,349
previously one section have been split

1278
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:47,380
into multiple sections and some previous

1279
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:49,480
multiple sections of income line new

1280
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:54,310
organization it's a little more more

1281
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:55,509
logical and straightforward and just to

1282
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:57,020
give sort of a little flavor of the

1283
01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:00,110
protocol

1284
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:02,510
a couple slides here the s capiz is this

1285
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:03,950
a extensible message formatted as a

1286
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:07,580
message header and there's t all these

1287
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:09,800
not too surprising some T of these can

1288
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:12,850
have sub TVs in them it's possible to

1289
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,900
for vendors to construct their own

1290
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:20,510
message it's a vendor mess specified

1291
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:23,150
message and a vendor specified TLV this

1292
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:25,130
shows the the message header it's got a

1293
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:27,710
type and a message length and

1294
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:29,390
transaction ID and stuff it's pretty

1295
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:32,620
much of a request response kind of

1296
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:35,270
protocol the tle header format has a a

1297
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:37,099
shown as logically having this operation

1298
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:39,590
field at the top of the type area you

1299
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:42,860
can sort of considered that to be all

1300
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:45,650
the one in sort of type field or or not

1301
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,880
certain tlvs there's an operation that

1302
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:49,309
can be associated with the t Ovie's

1303
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:52,120
which is an operation being performed on

1304
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:57,800
data blocks that are specified by the

1305
01:11:52,120 --> 01:12:00,940
within that TLV so and here are the

1306
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:03,950
different categories of messages as

1307
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:05,929
they're divided in this latest version

1308
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:07,670
of the draft and the various different

1309
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:12,020
categories of tlvs

1310
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:13,900
so if you want more information than

1311
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:16,640
these three graphs you should read the

1312
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:20,030
127 pages that are in the draft you'll

1313
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:29,930
learn a lot more of that so that's all I

1314
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:34,599
had to say please and myself posted our

1315
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:38,030
draft which did an analysis using forces

1316
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:40,880
the mailing list went dead is I guess

1317
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:46,969
what he waited for the BBF interaction

1318
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:48,350
to say this is an ITF work or not I'm

1319
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:50,690
not sure I heard you exactly but yes I

1320
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:52,730
don't believe there's any intent to for

1321
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:54,799
the IETF to adopt any drafts or do

1322
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:57,110
anything here ago we've heard for the

1323
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,780
BBF okay so it's reasonable for us to

1324
01:12:57,110 --> 01:13:02,089
continue posting updates to the forces

1325
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:04,130
draft I think anybody who can post

1326
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,180
graphs that they want that they think or

1327
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,250
have interests and they think that

1328
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:10,300
people would like to read yeah all right

1329
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:10,300
we'll post an update then

1330
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:25,369
thank you thank you I think David was

1331
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:33,320
going one second yeah well it David

1332
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:35,210
provide an update on the BBF sure sure

1333
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:48,949
why not we yeah just these are

1334
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:51,530
independent not a perfect so again I'm

1335
01:13:48,949 --> 01:13:53,239
the ietf liaison manager to the

1336
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:56,449
broadband forum so I'm speaking with

1337
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:59,750
that hat on just to give you an idea of

1338
01:13:56,449 --> 01:14:04,190
the work that was started as a result of

1339
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:06,590
the B Kozlov the work in the BBF is

1340
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:11,030
progressing well the work there is known

1341
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:14,510
as WT 4:59 disaggregated bng and you

1342
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:18,280
should be able to find a line item on it

1343
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:21,020
in the BBF work-in-progress page

1344
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,639
basically what's there is the equivalent

1345
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:26,320
of a working group document it's well

1346
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:30,080
underway it contains the architecture

1347
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:32,150
the use cases protocol functional

1348
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,440
requirements and functional model

1349
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:36,619
requirements so it's fairly

1350
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:38,419
comprehensive document the scope of the

1351
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:41,570
work is the set of functions that are

1352
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:44,030
currently supported by BN G's today so

1353
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:46,759
not just completely fixed but also

1354
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:51,259
dealing with mobile and mobility

1355
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:54,590
integration the document does not get

1356
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:56,630
into protocol design we the BBF made

1357
01:14:54,590 --> 01:15:00,800
sure that that was something that was

1358
01:14:56,630 --> 01:15:04,130
designed as otoscope but rather it sets

1359
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:06,469
the stage for protocol selection either

1360
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:08,330
this protocol that Donald presented or

1361
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:11,300
others there are others out there and

1362
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:13,670
also and/or protocol design where gaps

1363
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:17,780
are found or a whole new protocols

1364
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:20,929
needed they've taken the output of the

1365
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:22,710
beacause ball very seriously the

1366
01:15:20,929 --> 01:15:24,750
discussions have been

1367
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:29,730
idly as they were during the because

1368
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:31,950
ball during the because Boff the BBF

1369
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:33,660
even despite all these lively

1370
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:35,460
discussions and the amount of discussion

1371
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,610
happening around this topic they're

1372
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,020
still looking to have a stable document

1373
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:42,330
especially with requirements after the

1374
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:45,390
third quarter meeting which is in early

1375
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:47,489
September and they also appreciate the

1376
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:50,270
IETF allowing them time to work through

1377
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:58,879
the requirements and all the discussion

1378
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:58,880
any questions okay okay thank you

1379
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:07,250
next up is Bingley you talking about

1380
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:07,250
instant congestion assessment Network

1381
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:18,200
good morning everyone my name is Anil

1382
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:21,630
today I'm going to introduce a new

1383
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:24,179
technology called instant congestion

1384
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:26,940
assessment network for data plane

1385
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:30,360
traffic engineering and please note that

1386
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:34,190
this is actually not a personal work on

1387
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:37,530
line it is a solid team work behind and

1388
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:44,580
including both solution design and

1389
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:46,679
prototype development now for the

1390
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:49,800
contents I briefly introduced the

1391
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:52,710
targeted challenges and it is mostly for

1392
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:55,230
our natural network now they now

1393
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:58,920
discussed the I can't architecture and

1394
01:16:55,230 --> 01:17:05,040
key technologies and then some use cases

1395
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:09,270
and scenarios for the challenge one is

1396
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:12,000
as we know in real network especially in

1397
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:15,330
metro network the traffic is always

1398
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,420
heavily unbalanced just as the figure

1399
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:22,590
shoes some things are highly overall did

1400
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:26,880
well some links may be very light loaded

1401
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:30,469
so the result is the whole network

1402
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:34,310
throughput is remain a very low level

1403
01:17:30,469 --> 01:17:38,120
huge risk of natural resources

1404
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:40,910
and current technologies such as ecmp

1405
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:44,300
cannot handle them very well because the

1406
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:47,870
SMB doesn't care about the real

1407
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:52,360
situation of congestion either on the

1408
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:56,540
local links or on the remote links and

1409
01:17:52,360 --> 01:18:00,230
for for the use EMP which involves in

1410
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:02,840
the centralised calculation of the

1411
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:07,339
multiple pass the controller will

1412
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:10,640
specify ratio of the multiple paths

1413
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:13,610
however in data plane because especially

1414
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:17,030
for the segment road in technology is

1415
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:20,719
get a plane there is no actual

1416
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:23,719
technology to guarantee and get a plane

1417
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:26,140
ratio aligned with the space that's

1418
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:31,790
specified ratio the main reason you that

1419
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:36,550
the router cannot sense the flow size

1420
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:40,160
and it can only dispatch the flow

1421
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:44,450
according to the flow nemours but not

1422
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:50,389
the exact of flow sites data first

1423
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:52,610
challenge the challenge to is that for

1424
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:56,060
some general considerations as we know

1425
01:18:52,610 --> 01:19:00,440
some natural network are actually

1426
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:04,370
evolving to more DC like architecture so

1427
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:09,139
within this context for example the

1428
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:12,590
cloud migration this factor will cause

1429
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:15,700
the traffic to be more difficult to plan

1430
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:19,100
or to predict now for some specific

1431
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:22,519
considerations if we look into the

1432
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:27,140
traffic in a very finer granularity for

1433
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:30,410
example in in milliseconds although the

1434
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:34,430
current traffic planning technology can

1435
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:37,760
make sure the traffic is okay in the in

1436
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:40,790
a longer interval but with a much lower

1437
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:44,360
interval it is still a very serious

1438
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:46,590
problem this is also why the Chinese one

1439
01:19:44,360 --> 01:20:00,009
existing

1440
01:19:46,590 --> 01:20:03,010
okay so - thank you so to address those

1441
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:06,940
challenges we proposed any solution I

1442
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:11,070
can solution so the essential idea is to

1443
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:15,129
allow very fast and the continuous

1444
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:19,570
measurement became inquest and egress

1445
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:22,840
rotors and before this we still rely on

1446
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:26,018
the controller to calculate multiple

1447
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:29,380
paths for each pair of ingress and

1448
01:20:26,019 --> 01:20:32,679
egress rotor this could be done in much

1449
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:38,679
slower interval for example minutes or

1450
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:42,489
even longer days after that all the job

1451
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:45,849
is handled to the rotor by themself the

1452
01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:50,138
ingress rotor will trigger the past

1453
01:20:45,849 --> 01:20:54,760
assessment this requires a egress router

1454
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:57,400
to collaborate this is the key

1455
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:01,449
technology one the pass quality

1456
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:04,839
assessment and this is done continuously

1457
01:21:01,449 --> 01:21:10,919
in a very fast manner millisecond level

1458
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:13,989
and then the ingress rotor will decide

1459
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,789
which flow need to be switched to

1460
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:19,780
another pass according to the

1461
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:24,340
measurement resort in order to do this

1462
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:29,409
the ingress rotor need to sense the flow

1463
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:32,110
size so that a top end flow will be

1464
01:21:29,409 --> 01:21:37,509
recognized this is something done

1465
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:41,380
totally within the rotor and note that

1466
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:44,980
the action solution only requires the

1467
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:47,920
ingress and egress rotor to be enabled

1468
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:51,690
with such mechanism the intermediate

1469
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,690
router doesn't need to do anything

1470
01:21:54,280 --> 01:22:02,929
and next my please thank you and with

1471
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:07,130
the same suit all core technologies but

1472
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:10,700
with four different purposes we can come

1473
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:14,770
up with three use cases the first one is

1474
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:22,400
of course the network load balance but

1475
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:26,120
it is a guaranteed balance for this one

1476
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:29,240
we already have a commercial wrote

1477
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:32,420
hardware water based prototype I briefly

1478
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:35,750
introduced indenter slides and the

1479
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:40,130
second one is for the SRA assurance for

1480
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:44,570
some very high priority services this

1481
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:48,260
resulting may be not very balanced to

1482
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:52,130
traffic but to make sure the most

1483
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:56,090
important flows can be guaranteed with

1484
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:58,760
the SLA the third one is the have a bit

1485
01:22:56,090 --> 01:23:03,230
higher building because the measurement

1486
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:07,040
itself intrinsically supports the BFG

1487
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:10,190
like functions and can even do more and

1488
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:13,940
the most advantageous is that there is

1489
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:20,540
no complex configuration for the account

1490
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:25,330
as the PFD requires and the I Cameron

1491
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:28,370
cannot come not only to the on all

1492
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:32,080
government but also the service

1493
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:35,240
degradation measurements this is also

1494
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:37,570
advantageous than the tradition ampere

1495
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,570
field

1496
01:23:39,929 --> 01:23:47,280
now for the department scenarios

1497
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:52,520
basically the ICANN is agnostic to the

1498
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:59,070
underlying forwarding technologies

1499
01:23:52,520 --> 01:24:04,949
either as our v6 or VX LAN MPLS can use

1500
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:07,340
this benefit from this technology next

1501
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:07,339
slide please

1502
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:19,949
this is the prototype I mentioned before

1503
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:24,630
for the network load balance use case we

1504
01:24:19,949 --> 01:24:30,799
developed it on the romaine stream water

1505
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:30,800
which is probably only 40 II and as

1506
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:41,880
sorry we got a pod ELISA

1507
01:24:38,429 --> 01:24:46,620
as you can see the topology there's the

1508
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:51,810
AIDS rotor and we used the traffic

1509
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:54,659
generator to push the traffic into the

1510
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:57,090
network and according to the physical

1511
01:24:54,659 --> 01:25:03,320
capacity the network should be handled

1512
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:07,140
up to 80 gigabyte per second traffic

1513
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:13,830
with the tradition SMP technology when

1514
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:18,090
the traffic is up to 48 or at most 50

1515
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:23,820
gigabytes there is packet drop happening

1516
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:28,050
but with the ICANN system enabling the

1517
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:32,639
throughput can be reached to 61 to 65 in

1518
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:36,500
abet which is 30% engine throughput

1519
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:36,500
your car could resort

1520
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:49,030
next please yeah that's the basic idea

1521
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:52,869
we also have some detailed description

1522
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:56,139
of the key technologies including the

1523
01:25:52,869 --> 01:26:01,598
measurement method and the method of how

1524
01:25:56,139 --> 01:26:04,059
to switch flows between path as the the

1525
01:26:01,599 --> 01:26:08,409
backup slides so you can read by

1526
01:26:04,059 --> 01:26:10,929
yourself and yes please comment emission

1527
01:26:08,409 --> 01:26:14,138
from juniper because in your example you

1528
01:26:10,929 --> 01:26:17,769
there's only one ingress router so

1529
01:26:14,139 --> 01:26:20,949
that's not a typical in case if you add

1530
01:26:17,769 --> 01:26:23,829
more ingress routers to the network and

1531
01:26:20,949 --> 01:26:26,888
then let's say assume that these ingress

1532
01:26:23,829 --> 01:26:31,030
router react to congestion at same time

1533
01:26:26,889 --> 01:26:33,909
right yeah yeah sure it does there will

1534
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:36,190
be a base condition and you know yeah

1535
01:26:33,909 --> 01:26:41,400
sure is now guarantee there you cannot

1536
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:41,400
remove the saturation on chance of a

1537
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:49,239
sorry did you ask two questions or just

1538
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:54,030
the one question just one question okay

1539
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:57,459
I mean the example you're giving to okay

1540
01:26:54,030 --> 01:27:02,199
there's definitely not only support one

1541
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:07,659
ingress rotary it is only a very brief

1542
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:12,250
representation but logically the system

1543
01:27:07,659 --> 01:27:15,879
works between a pair of ingress water

1544
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:18,130
and egress water but for deployment

1545
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:22,599
you can always be calling multiple pairs

1546
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:28,599
of ingress and egress that thus

1547
01:27:22,599 --> 01:27:31,960
naturally could be expanded its regular

1548
01:27:28,599 --> 01:27:38,619
acidity so you compare this method to B

1549
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:43,809
of D yes only for the the whole ICANN is

1550
01:27:38,619 --> 01:27:48,339
not it is not against the beauty but

1551
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:51,039
with some extension we we can achieve

1552
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:54,730
some function most of the functions

1553
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:57,670
we have be in special scenarios but for

1554
01:27:54,730 --> 01:28:02,638
the whole for the whole system for the

1555
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:08,679
whole idea it is not meaning to against

1556
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:12,159
okay I have couple questions so you

1557
01:28:08,679 --> 01:28:15,340
propose to have some active om in

1558
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:16,808
addition to BFD were you planning to

1559
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:26,650
replace behavior

1560
01:28:16,809 --> 01:28:30,219
I guess never actually if you want to

1561
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:33,098
employ I can for better traffic either

1562
01:28:30,219 --> 01:28:36,909
for more balance the traffic between

1563
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:40,449
multipass or to guarantee in a very high

1564
01:28:36,909 --> 01:28:45,879
priority services and you can get some

1565
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:51,219
extra benefit of the PF key functions so

1566
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:53,949
that that's the only bonus for you not

1567
01:28:51,219 --> 01:28:59,110
to replace the whole PFT for all the

1568
01:28:53,949 --> 01:29:02,888
scenarios did I answer your question no

1569
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:07,150
I still kind of puzzle if you are

1570
01:29:02,889 --> 01:29:16,230
planning to use B or D or you introduce

1571
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:19,030
a new act if I am mechanism what I would

1572
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:22,018
invite and will like your feedback so

1573
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:24,909
and the BFD will have a discussion on

1574
01:29:22,019 --> 01:29:30,059
extended BB proposal and the whole idea

1575
01:29:24,909 --> 01:29:34,989
of extending VFD functionality beyond

1576
01:29:30,059 --> 01:29:38,710
their continuity check that will be

1577
01:29:34,989 --> 01:29:42,839
interesting to see how maps to proposal

1578
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:50,530
I can another reference I would give is

1579
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:53,829
look at draft in SFC group on using

1580
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:55,960
alternate marking method which explains

1581
01:29:53,829 --> 01:29:59,739
how ultimate marking method can be used

1582
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:01,179
to measure residence time because as I

1583
01:29:59,739 --> 01:30:03,610
understand what you are measuring your

1584
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:04,659
measuring presidents time the time the

1585
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:07,360
packet

1586
01:30:04,659 --> 01:30:11,559
traverses the note from ingress

1587
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:16,089
interface to egress interface so I think

1588
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:19,060
that there already some work being and

1589
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:22,170
thoughts being given to residence time

1590
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:24,580
and actually we do have an RFC on

1591
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:29,280
residence time measurement in MPLS

1592
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:33,420
networks okay would you mind us in the

1593
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:38,650
Middle East how send email yet summarize

1594
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:40,659
comments thank you I understand up here

1595
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:42,638
you mentioned about microbursts I'm

1596
01:30:40,659 --> 01:30:44,589
curious to see the solution as being the

1597
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,659
main target of microburst so you see for

1598
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:51,719
longer-term trends of bandwidth

1599
01:30:46,659 --> 01:30:54,250
utilization the sorted by the

1600
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:56,199
presentation talked about reacting to

1601
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:58,389
microbrews traffic microburst and no

1602
01:30:56,199 --> 01:31:00,009
easy MT your flows when you get

1603
01:30:58,389 --> 01:31:02,500
microburst situations you can't handle

1604
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:03,940
it but part of the situation the

1605
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,980
solution involves a controller to

1606
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,449
calculate these paths now depending on

1607
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:09,159
the microbe Anderson the frequency is

1608
01:31:07,449 --> 01:31:11,379
microbrews you might be wasting a lot of

1609
01:31:09,159 --> 01:31:13,210
cycles you know trying to react to these

1610
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,770
microbursts and actually have these

1611
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:16,900
paths being deployed and by the time

1612
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:18,310
they're deployed a useless so I'd be

1613
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:20,530
curious to see in the solution how you

1614
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:24,750
would handle timing in terms of those

1615
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:29,949
Microverse yeah yeah yeah that's exactly

1616
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:33,370
the one of the most motivation of why we

1617
01:31:29,949 --> 01:31:35,739
start this work you're absolutely right

1618
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:38,199
for the controller it is almost

1619
01:31:35,739 --> 01:31:42,089
impossible to handle the macro curse

1620
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:45,699
intervals so we allow a very fast

1621
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:49,600
merriment directly on a data plane in

1622
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:52,928
our implementation the egress rotor will

1623
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:56,889
feed back some Merriman results every

1624
01:31:52,929 --> 01:32:00,460
three point three milliseconds and then

1625
01:31:56,889 --> 01:32:03,850
the ingress rotor will calculate and do

1626
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:04,719
the traffic adjustment every 10

1627
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:07,960
millisecond

1628
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:10,989
that's our current implementation and it

1629
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:17,650
can handle the necro post farewell but

1630
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:21,669
in still laboratory level we want to

1631
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:25,679
two more experiment in a real Network so

1632
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:28,240
we want to find partners especially from

1633
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,460
operators who are interested in this

1634
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:34,059
function

1635
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:38,410
thank you discover multi this works

1636
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:42,040
let's take your name name in Appalachia

1637
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:44,530
okay so including Lisa me from Cisco so

1638
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:48,010
there's this cover because a multicast

1639
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:52,530
are both currently way we're getting

1640
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:56,950
consider multicast so if it's multicast

1641
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:59,200
so you just mention that English dr.

1642
01:32:56,950 --> 01:33:01,870
initiate path assessment and multicast

1643
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:03,340
case usually it's from eager side when

1644
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:05,559
despair comes in picture that's what I

1645
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:11,460
can all we will try to pull the traffic

1646
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:15,550
oh yeah I agree in multicast is more

1647
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:18,400
sophisticated that currently we we

1648
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:19,240
didn't support it we can consider it

1649
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:25,120
later

1650
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:27,849
thank you David David Melman from

1651
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:32,590
Marbella how do you deal with the

1652
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:34,870
potential problem of out of flow packet

1653
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:38,800
order when you're doing the paths which

1654
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:43,750
based on the load you do flow let based

1655
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:50,440
a switching yeah good question would you

1656
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:57,240
help me to the next one maybe the last

1657
01:33:50,440 --> 01:34:00,660
one I guess next yes the pecking order

1658
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:04,210
issue and the oscillation issue

1659
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:08,290
basically is to based on the flow let

1660
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:11,830
and if there's no flow let the water

1661
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:15,280
will false or follow that that will

1662
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:19,750
break the flow into two parts the

1663
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:23,139
further part will go into a high

1664
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:25,540
priority cooing in the rotor to make

1665
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:30,169
sure it will be forwarded as fast as

1666
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:35,630
possible and the back end

1667
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:39,769
of the flow we'll get into slower a

1668
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:44,510
longer QE that to make sure the two

1669
01:34:39,769 --> 01:34:47,419
packet will transfer in time interval

1670
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:50,030
there won't be a other issue and to

1671
01:34:47,419 --> 01:34:52,849
avoid the oscillation we will remember

1672
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:55,880
which flow had been switched

1673
01:34:52,849 --> 01:34:58,579
then within some time maybe five minutes

1674
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:00,469
we won't touch the floor again to avoid

1675
01:34:58,579 --> 01:35:02,049
the same flow to be switched back

1676
01:35:00,469 --> 01:35:08,090
between

1677
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:12,409
thank you have a question so the draft

1678
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:14,329
itself is very very general has no

1679
01:35:12,409 --> 01:35:15,799
technical detail whatsoever so what's

1680
01:35:14,329 --> 01:35:18,079
your plan with it you set a framework

1681
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:20,389
and then to provide more drugs with more

1682
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:24,590
technical details what you're going to

1683
01:35:20,389 --> 01:35:28,989
do with it yeah the current draft is

1684
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:31,760
only a skeleton of the whole story and

1685
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:34,938
because these are the first hand we

1686
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:38,389
present the whole idea in our community

1687
01:35:34,939 --> 01:35:41,139
we want to get feedback especially from

1688
01:35:38,389 --> 01:35:44,449
operators do you think this is a

1689
01:35:41,139 --> 01:35:46,639
valuable work to do

1690
01:35:44,449 --> 01:35:49,989
do you think it is meaningful for your

1691
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:53,539
real network you want to improve your

1692
01:35:49,989 --> 01:35:55,909
your transmission quality especially in

1693
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:59,959
Action Network we want some more

1694
01:35:55,909 --> 01:36:02,058
feedback and if people agree ok this is

1695
01:35:59,959 --> 01:36:05,389
a good thing to do then for some

1696
01:36:02,059 --> 01:36:09,079
following up actions there's definitely

1697
01:36:05,389 --> 01:36:11,769
some work related to IPM some

1698
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:17,320
measurement and maybe also some

1699
01:36:11,769 --> 01:36:20,329
operational signaling between the rotors

1700
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:22,070
my point it dropped in scarring from

1701
01:36:20,329 --> 01:36:23,389
doesn't have enough details to solicit

1702
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:25,489
proper field it would be good if you

1703
01:36:23,389 --> 01:36:27,099
upgrade it with a bit more date and then

1704
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:33,678
ask people on the list

1705
01:36:27,099 --> 01:36:34,699
thank you thanks thanks next up we have

1706
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:39,110
Reza

1707
01:36:34,699 --> 01:36:42,308
requi talking about 5g transport slice

1708
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:42,308
connectivity interface

1709
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:55,430
good morning everyone my name is Rosa

1710
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:58,339
rockweed on behalf of my co-author or

1711
01:36:55,430 --> 01:37:01,670
myself I'm going to present this new

1712
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:03,980
draft regarding 5g transverse wise

1713
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:05,630
connectivity interface before going

1714
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:08,509
through this draft it's important to

1715
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:11,720
note that there has been a net project

1716
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:14,990
at BBF it has been accepted few weeks

1717
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:17,150
ago it's related to this area and I

1718
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:21,980
already talked to Dave's in a crop and

1719
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:24,589
others and it's under discussion how

1720
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:26,419
this fork and B bf4 can collaborate with

1721
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:28,550
each other how they complement each

1722
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:30,680
other and whether or not there is a

1723
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:32,810
synergy between them and how it's going

1724
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:35,150
to work so basically this is ongoing

1725
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:37,760
discussion I'm part of the BBF as well

1726
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:39,799
but it's important to note that the at

1727
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:44,060
the end these two should work together

1728
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:47,210
and basically provide a bigger picture

1729
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:49,490
how ITF and BBF can work together to

1730
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:51,800
define this interface the name is

1731
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:56,650
different at BBF but the concept is more

1732
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:59,450
or less the same this work is related to

1733
01:37:56,650 --> 01:38:02,570
5g Antoinette worker slicing this

1734
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:05,480
picture try to depict the whole idea of

1735
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:08,420
the five unit focus slicing and how they

1736
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:10,730
work at idea it basically relates to

1737
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:13,070
that the console net forget slicing in

1738
01:38:10,730 --> 01:38:15,139
this picture you will see from the left

1739
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:18,049
right the PowerPoint presentation is

1740
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:20,720
better it has the animation but anyway

1741
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:24,530
here I'm trying to explain from the left

1742
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:26,660
to right there are few tenants BMW fear

1743
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:29,860
public safety there are tenants or

1744
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:33,500
customers which basically want to have

1745
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:36,679
logical independent network from the

1746
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:39,320
left which is the UE all the way to the

1747
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:41,900
right which is the application we call

1748
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:45,769
each of these logical independent

1749
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:48,139
network the end-to-end net focus lies in

1750
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:52,190
this picture I have five net focus lies

1751
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:54,530
and each color you can think of the SLA

1752
01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:56,419
for that a specific end-to-end the

1753
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:58,940
network a slice we want

1754
01:38:56,420 --> 01:39:01,730
to have each of these into a networker

1755
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:04,700
slides we meet ran a slice personality

1756
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:06,709
on ran we meet chorus lies personality

1757
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:08,960
encore and at the end we need

1758
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:10,870
connectivity between their which is

1759
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,610
basically the discussion of this topic

1760
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:17,180
transfer the slide transfer slides are

1761
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:21,110
the logical connectivity between various

1762
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:23,180
components so each of these ran call

1763
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:24,920
transport needs a controller

1764
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:28,160
it needs a controller to basically

1765
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:30,050
control the connectivity that is needed

1766
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,940
and at the end for the end to a network

1767
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:34,520
of slides we need a refrigerator the

1768
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:36,769
topic of our discussion is specifically

1769
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:39,560
in this discussion is transverse lies

1770
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:42,830
and how it relates to whatever enter

1771
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:46,760
whatever IETF already has on how we can

1772
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:49,010
work together so this is basically to

1773
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:50,930
create one of those into a network a

1774
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:54,170
slice click one of them in the previous

1775
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:56,900
picture and here I try to basically show

1776
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:59,810
the logical steps these are not by any

1777
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:02,120
means a specific read your steps as I

1778
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:04,910
put it in the yellow node but it's the

1779
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:07,430
kind of logical steps from the customer

1780
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:10,010
portal all the way to the network from

1781
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:14,360
customer portal sends a request to end

1782
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:17,540
to a network as like a company the why I

1783
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:20,660
want to create a type of service with a

1784
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:23,780
specific SLA and it goes to orchestrate

1785
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:26,389
or orchestrate or creates a profile and

1786
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:29,990
then it goes through some decomposition

1787
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:31,730
as the name suggests Dave you have a

1788
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:34,940
question yeah question for clarification

1789
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:36,889
on your slide it says transport slice

1790
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:39,259
connectivity interface are you seeing

1791
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:43,100
that as a singular interface to control

1792
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:45,830
all transport network function or is

1793
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:48,710
that a set of interfaces the latter one

1794
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:52,040
it could be a set of functions that as

1795
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:55,390
you will see as I go through it it this

1796
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:59,570
interface addresses three the functions

1797
01:40:55,390 --> 01:41:00,670
automation aka creation monitoring and

1798
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:03,110
assurance

1799
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:04,970
analytics and optimization whether or

1800
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:08,240
not we need one interface to address

1801
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:10,070
these three or we need three or more

1802
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,619
basically this under discussion

1803
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:15,440
in my opinion I think it's a multiple

1804
01:41:12,619 --> 01:41:17,389
interfaces ok the address so I wouldn't

1805
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:20,119
be wrong to interpret that as a typo and

1806
01:41:17,389 --> 01:41:22,840
it should say interfaces interfaces it

1807
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:27,650
should be definitely yeah thanks

1808
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:32,750
so a step two goes to the decomposition

1809
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:37,070
and after that a step three four and

1810
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:40,610
five six basically try to create various

1811
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:42,909
slices on the rancor and transfer the

1812
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:45,980
important aspect in this picture is

1813
01:41:42,909 --> 01:41:49,190
interface four and five which comes to

1814
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:51,610
ram controller and core controller

1815
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:55,329
respectively are defined in various

1816
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:58,579
technical specification on 3gpp and

1817
01:41:55,329 --> 01:42:00,469
interfaces is basically the discussion

1818
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:04,429
of this meeting that we want to have

1819
01:42:00,469 --> 01:42:06,679
similar interface for transport which

1820
01:42:04,429 --> 01:42:09,679
basically aligned with 3gpp interface

1821
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:13,010
four and five how we can define

1822
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:15,139
interface six and how this relates to

1823
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:18,440
our ITF fork that we already have

1824
01:42:15,139 --> 01:42:20,840
various various data models and work

1825
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:23,299
that has been done at ITF how this

1826
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:25,610
interface relates that basically this is

1827
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:29,179
the topic of this discussion I put it in

1828
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:32,630
red here to just clarify that we talked

1829
01:42:29,179 --> 01:42:35,300
about transport SMS creation but that

1830
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:37,550
one should be addressed every time that

1831
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:40,670
we talk about transfers like we have to

1832
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:42,619
think of an end-to-end Network a slice

1833
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:44,420
that I want to create in the network as

1834
01:42:42,619 --> 01:42:47,920
a result of that I need to create

1835
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:50,630
transport ran and code yet then go ahead

1836
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:54,170
why do you create two separate transport

1837
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:56,210
slices and you know you have like a 5 g

1838
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:57,710
TS each and then it goes to the third

1839
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:59,960
party controllers it creates another

1840
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:02,560
transport transfer a slice is a set of

1841
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:06,949
connections for example in this specific

1842
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:10,310
topic the right one is addressing

1843
01:43:06,949 --> 01:43:13,909
connectivity between ran and call the

1844
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:15,770
left one is addressing the connectivity

1845
01:43:13,909 --> 01:43:18,320
in ran because this is a cloud run

1846
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:21,110
between for example vu and see you so

1847
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:23,610
basically your endpoints of connectivity

1848
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:26,940
are different in the first one is

1849
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:30,420
to call the second one is inside the

1850
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:32,370
rent equipment between C U and vu so

1851
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:34,800
basically since we have different end

1852
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:37,769
points we have different transfers and I

1853
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,690
put transfer slices there is capital it

1854
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:42,840
means that this is not one connectivity

1855
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:45,240
if I have ran one two three I want to

1856
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,130
connect it to call one two basically the

1857
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,370
set of connection that I have to do and

1858
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:51,180
basically this is the whole idea of this

1859
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:53,640
picture show

1860
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:56,520
so long story short we are discussing

1861
01:43:53,640 --> 01:44:00,450
their red item in this picture and how

1862
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:03,470
it's related to idea so these two

1863
01:44:00,450 --> 01:44:06,870
picture I put it there to make sure we

1864
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:09,900
clearly see whatever we want to do here

1865
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:13,740
is really related to 3gpp on the left

1866
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:16,410
hand side top left it any document that

1867
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:20,610
you open from 3G 15 you see this picture

1868
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:23,099
and in this one basically the transfer a

1869
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:25,200
slice of connectivity are our dash line

1870
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:27,750
but we shall not basically define an

1871
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:29,280
3gpp and the whole intention is that the

1872
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:32,010
yellow box that I put there

1873
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:34,740
transfers life is basically defining on

1874
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:36,990
dashed line that from 3gpp they are not

1875
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:39,210
addressing it and we want to make sure

1876
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:42,510
we are addressing it the same way that

1877
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:45,390
they address call and run and the bottom

1878
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:47,490
right picture is basically if you see it

1879
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:49,740
is very similar to the picture that I

1880
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:52,580
showed you in the previous slide and the

1881
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:55,290
whole idea of the transfer slice is

1882
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:58,170
defined here the name is different but

1883
01:44:55,290 --> 01:45:00,540
the concept is the same so the short

1884
01:44:58,170 --> 01:45:02,900
summary of these three slides are we

1885
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:06,410
want to define an interface between

1886
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:09,540
transfer the slice controller and top

1887
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:12,080
Orchestrator to basically align whatever

1888
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:14,850
we want for a tree for a transport

1889
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:18,650
similar to the run on cup so this is

1890
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:18,650
basically the summary of this

1891
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:29,370
presentation and this draft in this

1892
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:31,559
picture I try to put together there are

1893
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:34,610
top Orchestrator

1894
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:37,910
there are three controllers left is red

1895
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:40,670
right its core and the middle east

1896
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:44,360
sometimes you take a look at the 3gpp

1897
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:46,760
they call the controllers that we are

1898
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:50,540
referring to ran and transfer and code

1899
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:52,430
they call it and ssmf network sub slice

1900
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:55,400
management function but it's basically

1901
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:57,050
the same idea the important aspect of

1902
01:45:55,400 --> 01:46:00,339
this picture I finished it and I go

1903
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:03,170
today is trying to mention that the

1904
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:06,520
functionality which are needed for each

1905
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:09,770
of these including the transport our

1906
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:12,380
automation or creation monitoring and

1907
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:14,240
analytics and optimization so in most

1908
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:16,310
cases when we talk about transfers of

1909
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:18,349
what we talk about creation but it's

1910
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:21,310
very important to make sure we address

1911
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:24,080
the other two functions of Dave please

1912
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:26,030
thank you Dave Schoeneck Rob Eriksen so

1913
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:27,620
again I'm going to ask my question for

1914
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:29,450
clarification because after you answered

1915
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:31,070
and said it was interface is that there

1916
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:41,630
will be more than one you went on to

1917
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:44,360
explain it as a singular interface so my

1918
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:47,030
question is this are we looking for one

1919
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:50,240
singular transport slice connectivity

1920
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:52,190
interface they can accurately represent

1921
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:54,410
all the different types of transport

1922
01:46:52,190 --> 01:46:56,990
technologies that would be under it yes

1923
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:59,240
this is the intention I know the

1924
01:46:56,990 --> 01:47:01,519
intention is to have a singular slice

1925
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:03,559
interface that represents all the

1926
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,890
different types of transport technology

1927
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:09,590
underneath yes as I go to the next slide

1928
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:12,850
I clarified that one the idea here is

1929
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:16,010
this interface similar to 3gpp our

1930
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:18,380
technology agnostic and other what how

1931
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:20,540
we are implementing let's say I give you

1932
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:24,920
an example I want to connect in the not

1933
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:30,170
very simple that 5g or 4G connectivity I

1934
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:32,960
want to connect in ODB to a core the

1935
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:36,050
connectivity it has I want to connect

1936
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,760
ran to call and with a specific isolate

1937
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:40,220
my latency should be less than 5

1938
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:43,280
millisecond my bandwidth should be more

1939
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:45,340
than 10 megabit per second how this one

1940
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:48,019
is implemented in the network

1941
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:50,030
implementation or realization really

1942
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:51,199
doesn't change the fact that I want to

1943
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:53,840
connect this together

1944
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:56,059
I can connect at the end of the day I

1945
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,610
can connect grant to course through some

1946
01:47:56,060 --> 01:48:02,239
routers in the middle using layer 3 VPN

1947
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:04,070
or I can simply use rocket VPLS

1948
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:06,428
connectivity of layer through lavatory

1949
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:08,599
the connectivity is the same

1950
01:48:06,429 --> 01:48:10,640
implementation and realization is

1951
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:12,800
different and this is one of the item

1952
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:16,810
that in my opinion should hold to make

1953
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:20,090
sure for example we are separating the

1954
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:21,620
implementation from the definition of

1955
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:24,290
that and this is basically that

1956
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:26,870
abstraction layer that is created how I

1957
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:28,790
can implement the need for network maybe

1958
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:31,760
in the future there is a new way of

1959
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:34,010
implementation of light or layers 3

1960
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,380
services in the network it should not

1961
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:38,989
change this interest and this is exactly

1962
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:41,390
the same for 3gpp those interfaces

1963
01:48:38,989 --> 01:48:44,540
regardless of how is implemented

1964
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:46,699
who is the vendor and how detail is the

1965
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:48,800
implementation of random code they are

1966
01:48:46,699 --> 01:48:50,809
very generic I want to connect of any

1967
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:54,410
creative personality for networkers life

1968
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:57,170
with some estimate focus was ID my SLA

1969
01:48:54,410 --> 01:49:00,199
is this and very high level and this is

1970
01:48:57,170 --> 01:49:01,940
basically aligned with them so can I

1971
01:49:00,199 --> 01:49:06,650
interrupt for a second just to ask

1972
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:08,389
perhaps a naive question related to you

1973
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:11,900
also mention broadband forum as well

1974
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:14,780
earlier in your presentation so as I

1975
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:17,299
understand it 3gpp has said and has

1976
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:23,330
defined the ran slice interface and the

1977
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:26,000
core slice interface good ok have they

1978
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:32,090
said we are not doing the transport

1979
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:33,560
slice this is exactly so can you I'd

1980
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:36,679
like more perspective on this as well

1981
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:39,320
especially via a minute switch hats so

1982
01:49:36,679 --> 01:49:43,310
no longer Ericsson but now the IETF

1983
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:46,549
plays I manager to the BBF what si5 has

1984
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:48,890
done in its its 3gpp sa five that are

1985
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:52,370
that are doing the asking they've set

1986
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:54,410
out a widespread liaison asking for the

1987
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:57,050
interfaces the network management

1988
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:58,820
interfaces that can be used to

1989
01:49:57,050 --> 01:50:01,429
facilitate network slicing in the

1990
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:03,380
transport level they sent this liaison a

1991
01:50:01,429 --> 01:50:04,699
belief to IETF although I'm not exactly

1992
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:06,860
sure but they

1993
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:09,589
they sent it to at least like three or

1994
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:11,780
four other stos that are well known to

1995
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:16,370
be involved in the transport space so

1996
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:18,469
MAF BBF studied with 15 etc each one of

1997
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:21,110
these groups has answered that liaison

1998
01:50:18,469 --> 01:50:24,710
with what they can offer in terms of

1999
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:28,549
network management interfaces so the the

2000
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:31,250
I what I'm hearing resin mention is that

2001
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:33,230
the target interface here is an

2002
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:35,510
abstraction of all of these different

2003
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:38,360
management interfaces that have been set

2004
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:42,860
back that's a lot and I have a picture

2005
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:44,989
to show here the maybe can discuss them

2006
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:47,690
all here but basically short summary if

2007
01:50:44,989 --> 01:50:49,910
jgp we didn't define this interface and

2008
01:50:47,690 --> 01:50:52,730
based on the discussion that we had with

2009
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:55,250
operators you know there is a need to

2010
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:58,370
have the same type of the logic

2011
01:50:55,250 --> 01:51:00,530
interface with transfers some work they

2012
01:50:58,370 --> 01:51:03,469
got started in BB F that raises

2013
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:07,309
referring to is on transport network

2014
01:51:03,469 --> 01:51:09,199
management slice interfaces

2015
01:51:07,310 --> 01:51:11,860
there's been no presumption that there

2016
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:15,049
will be one interface to rule them all

2017
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:17,330
so T has been working on similar stuff

2018
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:19,250
have they received alike I mean has

2019
01:51:17,330 --> 01:51:22,790
anyone an idea of actually received it

2020
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:24,380
and started working on it I can check

2021
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:30,320
the statements page but it would be

2022
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:31,250
coming from 3gpp essay 5 thank you I

2023
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:34,429
have a comment

2024
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:36,440
my name is Uma from hook feature a so

2025
01:51:34,429 --> 01:51:38,620
you talked about end-to-end slices and

2026
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:42,019
you are focusing on the transport part

2027
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:44,840
what happens if a microwave link between

2028
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:47,449
the ran ran interface between the Ino

2029
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:50,120
TRG node P to the Southside router goes

2030
01:51:47,449 --> 01:51:51,769
bad so do you care about that what

2031
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:54,530
happens to the end-to-end slicing so

2032
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:56,360
your transport slice is good but the ran

2033
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:58,989
interface has a problem like you know

2034
01:51:56,360 --> 01:52:01,339
micro link is bad or optical is not good

2035
01:51:58,989 --> 01:52:02,839
do you take care of that scenario and

2036
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:05,270
you move these slices to the different

2037
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:07,040
slice overall or what do you do there

2038
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:08,840
actually there are two aspect to that

2039
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:10,969
one you know we can have a slight

2040
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:13,610
discussion on that one is when we are

2041
01:52:10,969 --> 01:52:17,690
creating this various ran core and

2042
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:18,809
transport slice and in some document

2043
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:21,480
they call it subs

2044
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:24,360
or they call it submit is the same thing

2045
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:26,790
one is connectivity between them they

2046
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:29,759
basically don't talk about that how I

2047
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:32,010
connect rent to transport and transport

2048
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:34,230
2-chloro slices to have that real

2049
01:52:32,010 --> 01:52:35,730
end-to-end from the data path point of

2050
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:37,830
view so this is one aspect

2051
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:40,679
another aspect if you're talking about

2052
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:43,019
how I can make sure that end-to-end net

2053
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:45,930
focus lies monitoring and assurance

2054
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:47,970
Forks in that case the end-to-end says

2055
01:52:45,930 --> 01:52:49,980
it's not working because there is some

2056
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:52,980
problem with the read and how that will

2057
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:54,750
translate to transport maybe they have

2058
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:56,580
to change the transport connectivity or

2059
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:59,310
they have to - it should the change

2060
01:52:56,580 --> 01:53:02,370
there are in other words in this picture

2061
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:04,590
neither rancor and transport doesn't

2062
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:07,410
understand the end-to-end context and

2063
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:09,210
the marks aren't at the top basically so

2064
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:11,760
I have a problem we can't do it it

2065
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:13,680
should say I have to change the ran or

2066
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,810
transferred or call or all of them

2067
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:17,820
together so basically this is a short

2068
01:53:15,810 --> 01:53:19,980
summary of how it for connectivity and

2069
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:22,590
the assurance that they entered context

2070
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:24,150
okay so the one more comment actually

2071
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:26,640
this good good answer thank you so much

2072
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:28,620
so we have put a draft in DMM working

2073
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:30,180
group three IDs back we presented and we

2074
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:32,820
have been will present Nick this

2075
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:36,930
Wednesday - which talks about similar

2076
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:38,670
area but not not or not this actual the

2077
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:40,920
slicing aspect another end-to-end here

2078
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:42,930
but what needs to happen when the

2079
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:44,760
mobility happens when the ue in the 5g

2080
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:47,040
network moves from one gino to another G

2081
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:49,050
node V but the transport the end-to-end

2082
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:51,420
slices of the similar SLA cetera are not

2083
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:54,090
after the car in the target G node V

2084
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:55,590
that aspect need is addressed in the DMM

2085
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:57,300
working group that is called transport

2086
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:59,250
aware mobility there's a track there

2087
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:00,600
there is a correlation between your

2088
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:02,490
thing what you are doing and you know

2089
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:06,030
the work that's being done there if you

2090
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:08,460
do my can we talk certain be giving more

2091
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:11,190
information or thanks for the info go

2092
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:14,400
ahead Denton's yeah when you mentioned

2093
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:17,070
here the 5g transport slicing and you

2094
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:18,660
said that those interfaces should be

2095
01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:21,360
technology agnostic

2096
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:24,620
that you would be specifying some higher

2097
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:26,700
level SLA because you said here that the

2098
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:30,750
characteristics and work into the

2099
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:32,200
characteristics do you believe that this

2100
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:36,370
is the right

2101
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:38,500
area to do that because what you're

2102
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:42,160
talking is more an operator perspective

2103
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:45,760
and less of a vendor perspective and we

2104
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:48,130
had some issues with with technical

2105
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:52,750
service model developments in the past

2106
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:54,850
yeah I don't this I don't know whether

2107
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:57,970
or not this is the right and the place

2108
01:54:54,850 --> 01:55:01,720
and this good question absolutely and I

2109
01:54:57,970 --> 01:55:04,450
want to see whether or not there is some

2110
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:06,340
relevance of this work to this working

2111
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:08,320
group and I want to get the consensus of

2112
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:10,840
others but this is a good question and

2113
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:13,809
I'm looking forward to get the answer

2114
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:17,020
for that so I have a few minutes let me

2115
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:19,890
just finish my thought here and after we

2116
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:23,140
can take questions there so in summary

2117
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:26,200
what we want to do is the red box here

2118
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:29,200
we want to define that interfaces there

2119
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:31,480
should be asked here to address three

2120
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:33,490
things and all the time you have to

2121
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,919
think about that three thing not only

2122
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:38,440
the creation but rather monitoring

2123
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,540
analytics and optimization these are

2124
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:42,400
very important aspect that should be

2125
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:46,090
addressed and my opinion in previous

2126
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:48,490
discussions or some other draft they

2127
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:50,920
don't talk about these to us they just

2128
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:52,750
talk about creation and very you think

2129
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,210
that can happen so but we have two other

2130
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:58,450
stree at the same time so in action

2131
01:55:55,210 --> 01:56:01,980
again if it is PowerPoint it has the

2132
01:55:58,450 --> 01:56:05,190
animation but I'm trying to adjust the

2133
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:07,509
starting we want to create this yellow

2134
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:10,269
Antoinette focus lies with some a

2135
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:13,510
specific information do they have a

2136
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:16,870
network a slice ID - any in the 3gpp

2137
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:20,020
lingo they call it s and s si but it's

2138
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:22,210
basically net focus lies ID fit some for

2139
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:24,610
some customers on the service info

2140
01:56:22,210 --> 01:56:26,920
service service infotainment and with

2141
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:29,799
some a specific SLA to create that

2142
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:32,500
yellow connectivity from ran all the way

2143
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:35,590
to core orchestrate or which is sitting

2144
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:40,060
at the very car creates ran and called

2145
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:42,310
the also it create the transport our

2146
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:45,439
discussion is a transport and these are

2147
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:48,019
the choosing a step two and three please

2148
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:50,269
to entry this is another aspect that we

2149
01:56:48,019 --> 01:56:52,189
have to I think we have to address it at

2150
01:56:50,269 --> 01:56:54,289
the transport controller when they

2151
01:56:52,189 --> 01:56:56,719
receive that abstract connectivity

2152
01:56:54,289 --> 01:56:59,829
request how they are going to translate

2153
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:02,449
that one to some implementation of

2154
01:56:59,829 --> 01:57:04,880
realization in the network I think there

2155
01:57:02,449 --> 01:57:08,478
should be some requirement to define

2156
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:11,269
yeah and at the end number three is

2157
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:13,909
going to be creating some services

2158
01:57:11,269 --> 01:57:16,999
tunnels paths in the network with a

2159
01:57:13,909 --> 01:57:19,009
specific technology interface number one

2160
01:57:16,999 --> 01:57:21,050
doesn't have any technology it doesn't

2161
01:57:19,010 --> 01:57:24,439
say create connectivity between gene

2162
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:27,349
autry and the brand using l3 VPN or

2163
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:30,050
segment routing RSVP just said do the

2164
01:57:27,349 --> 01:57:32,959
connectivity between sake SLA and at the

2165
01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:36,229
end since this abstract sitting on top

2166
01:57:32,959 --> 01:57:38,780
of existing models in my opinion this

2167
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:41,809
picture is basically shows how this work

2168
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:45,050
is relevant to idea number one is

2169
01:57:41,809 --> 01:57:47,320
abstract connectivity requires which is

2170
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:51,309
sitting on top of number three which are

2171
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:54,259
existing IETF models for various tunnels

2172
01:57:51,309 --> 01:57:58,179
paths and services and basically this is

2173
01:57:54,260 --> 01:58:02,110
the relevance of this world to IETF

2174
01:57:58,179 --> 01:58:05,059
giorgos please yeah thank you data

2175
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:07,459
actually I was involved in starting this

2176
01:58:05,059 --> 01:58:10,869
new project in the bf together with Reza

2177
01:58:07,459 --> 01:58:14,269
and I'm going wrong from far away so

2178
01:58:10,869 --> 01:58:16,518
somehow driven live in the doctor work

2179
01:58:14,269 --> 01:58:19,789
there are some 12 companies that are

2180
01:58:16,519 --> 01:58:23,329
supporting that work what I wanted to

2181
01:58:19,789 --> 01:58:27,559
say is that these two activities will be

2182
01:58:23,329 --> 01:58:30,110
somehow related and already what Reza

2183
01:58:27,559 --> 01:58:32,959
meant already an important point is to

2184
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:35,239
identify what are the activities that

2185
01:58:32,959 --> 01:58:38,380
the BBF should do on this area because

2186
01:58:35,239 --> 01:58:40,820
that interfaces as another name is the

2187
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:44,449
transport network slice instance

2188
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:46,518
interfaces and here is up give another

2189
01:58:44,449 --> 01:58:48,678
name but we have to somehow synchronize

2190
01:58:46,519 --> 01:58:50,179
that but it's important I think there

2191
01:58:48,679 --> 01:58:52,309
will be you know some activities that

2192
01:58:50,179 --> 01:58:54,739
need to be done and DBF others other

2193
01:58:52,309 --> 01:58:56,449
activities need to be done an idea but

2194
01:58:54,739 --> 01:58:58,489
and we should synchronize that so if

2195
01:58:56,449 --> 01:59:00,759
this work will continue it needs to be a

2196
01:58:58,489 --> 01:59:03,230
synchronization

2197
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:06,500
thank you for yeah we will have a

2198
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:09,290
discussion to have exactly as giorgio

2199
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:13,490
smashing and basically this is a last

2200
01:59:09,290 --> 01:59:15,590
slide so we need to have more review

2201
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:19,010
discussion by didn't put it here but

2202
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:21,700
discussions between us and BBF we have

2203
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:25,340
to address in more detail the

2204
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:29,090
optimization assurance of an automation

2205
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:32,120
and finding the information model for

2206
01:59:29,090 --> 01:59:36,650
that with the requirements and hopefully

2207
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:39,730
the next ITF addressing those and also

2208
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:42,530
the discussion that we have at the PDF I

2209
01:59:39,730 --> 01:59:47,269
hope this one was clear and that's it

2210
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:50,420
this is the presentation thank you go

2211
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:53,240
ahead thank you Dave cynic robe speaking

2212
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:56,330
as ITF liaison manager from vivia or to

2213
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:58,550
beabea um can you make it can you

2214
01:59:56,330 --> 02:00:00,200
elaborate a little bit on how you see

2215
01:59:58,550 --> 02:00:02,540
the interaction between the two groups

2216
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:06,200
and the positioning of this work versus

2217
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:08,870
the work in the bar before the in my

2218
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:10,970
opinion that the again this is something

2219
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:13,760
that at the end of the day maybe we have

2220
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:16,280
to do only one of them so but at this

2221
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:20,270
time the way that I see it is we can

2222
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:23,059
from the IETF perspective we can have to

2223
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:26,930
define the requirements for example we

2224
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:30,350
need for the various technology which is

2225
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:33,850
related to ITF for example and that

2226
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:36,260
requirement will be basically the

2227
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:38,660
implemented for the value of the young

2228
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:41,510
model that we want you know for example

2229
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:44,210
at BBF there are two activities one is

2230
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:46,970
defining the requirement and one is the

2231
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:49,460
informational model so this is the way

2232
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:51,830
that I said at this time but again the

2233
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:54,050
discussion that we will have in more

2234
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:57,470
detail with George's and others from the

2235
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:59,930
BBF will clarify that one but at this

2236
02:00:57,470 --> 02:01:02,660
point I guess this the way that I said

2237
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:05,810
if George wants to add any comments and

2238
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:11,059
if he says and it's more than whatever I

2239
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:13,219
mentioned please with regard to routing

2240
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:15,530
area cooperation so a city

2241
02:01:13,219 --> 02:01:19,130
defines number of interfaces you might

2242
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:22,849
need a multi-layer network tears been

2243
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:24,440
working on mapping and mapping between

2244
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:27,650
different models that you would need

2245
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:30,469
so copywriters and myself so I just

2246
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:32,150
before George's sorry I'm going to

2247
02:01:30,469 --> 02:01:33,949
present this one at ease as well

2248
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:37,040
tomorrow yeah because for example

2249
02:01:33,949 --> 02:01:40,129
information model yeah is this possible

2250
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:42,199
that we use the various model that they

2251
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:44,360
have and how it's related to that this

2252
02:01:42,199 --> 02:01:46,820
is something that I'm gonna cut this off

2253
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:48,739
here so people can get to lunch

2254
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:51,530
appointments and so on we have another

2255
02:01:48,739 --> 02:01:53,389
meeting tomorrow Tuesday at the same

2256
02:01:51,530 --> 02:01:57,340
time 10:00 a.m. but in a different room

2257
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:57,340
thank you thank you very much
