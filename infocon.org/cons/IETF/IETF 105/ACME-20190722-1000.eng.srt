1
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:28,090
we use the sacrament meeting so I have

2
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,090
no idea how to do how to join a meeting

3
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,159
[Music]

4
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,580
[Music]

5
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,580
that's the rule

6
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,669
[Music]

7
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:43,250
hi we need somebody to take minutes just

12
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:57,380

13
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,660
those volunteers and yo points out that

14
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,910
our agenda has shrunk so we have about

15
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,260
20 minutes free time so we can just sit

16
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,790

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,240
be burnt out on volunteering for a

25
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:16,589
minute I know you

26
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,330

27
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:22,210
have to leave we want to get their input

28
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:27,430

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:37,509
then we'll be stuck again right Thank

32
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:42,270
You Robin

33
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:47,159
yep okay thank you Robin everybody yes

34
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,159
okay close the doors let's get sorted

35
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:59,500
okay welcome to the acne session here at

36
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:01,300
IDF 105 in Montreal mm-hmm I'm sure

37
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,210
you've seen this but this is the first

38
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:09,930
time you've seen it this week so it

39
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:12,159
hasn't changed much on the agenda today

40
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,930
obvious gender bashing administrivia

41
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:18,550
that's the streets going around and

42
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:21,029
finding scribes and mayor takers and the

43
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,889
note well which we have already seen

44
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:26,740
then we're going to do in status update

45
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm gonna get update on telephony with

46
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:34,120
no slides from John and we had planned

47
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,180
to have a presentation about TLS LPN but

48
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,330
since neither Rowland nor Jacob are in

49
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,880
or in Montreal and they haven't sent

50
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:50,539
slides jacob is

51
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:54,380
the jabber room so yeah we'll include it

52
00:07:50,540 --> 00:08:00,260
in their plate unless Jacob wants to hop

53
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:05,719
in from remote and then start allegation

54
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:09,170
Acme integration from Alexi about email

55
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:17,570
and you know then two things from

56
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:20,240
Kathleen any agenda bashing ok on to

57
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:25,610
status so we have new versions of the

58
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:29,710
telephony and the s/mime drafts the star

59
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,710
delegation was allowed to expire but

60
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:42,289
okay but we might be reviving it now and

61
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:43,660
I've seen that I wrote that twice yeah

62
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,540
[Music]

63
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:51,500
acne AP and the TLS LPN or in is G

64
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,099
processing there we need a revision of

65
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,640
TLS al PN which should be this week

66
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:18,410
anyone want to jump to the mic and say

67
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:20,990
something about that Jacob yes so to

68
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,860
summarize with acne IPD I mean it's

69
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,270
ready to go

70
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,430
I've just been holding to because I

71
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,310
wanted to batch together that document

72
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,979
with TLS you know because they're so

73
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,920
interrelated my kind of my remaining

74
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,570
points on on a opiate novelist and I

75
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,729
think there's one outstanding one from a

76
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:45,800
group so we can close that one plus the

77
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:52,000
minor ones I added weekend advances that

78
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,000
was Roman didn't he speak moments Rab

79
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:59,529
matthew miller echoing for Jacob he does

80
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,089
believe ruin will get to this week and

81
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:05,309
he'll bug him when he gets back vacation

82
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:09,489
today cool

83
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:13,589
so also acne star is an ITF last call

84
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:19,349
which is why start allegation is and now

85
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:21,459
revitalizing and CA is best is G

86
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:23,619
processing so it's now in the RFC

87
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:29,049
attackers queue hopefully we'll get an

88
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:30,729
RFC by next ITF so this is just to

89
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:33,369
finesse together the exact word and back

90
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:35,109
to the third bullet acne uh pls a that's

91
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:43,199
actually still with me we have not

92
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:48,729
advanced that you the whole is G okay

93
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:52,269
anything else about the updates good so

94
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:56,589
next are the presentations and looking

95
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:57,970
back at the agenda first up is John with

96
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:21,879
telephony update

97
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:23,889
oh and no slides so you don't get last

98
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,659
year so it's not like we have something

99
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,199
particularly new to present at this

100
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:29,619
point

101
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:31,059
that's hardly because actually changes

102
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:33,609
that we're still contemplating these

103
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:35,858
faster president at this point our thing

104
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,689
is that have yeah versions pendency

105
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:40,179
these are decisions that were still kind

106
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:42,849
of rolling over in the storica group I

107
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:44,679
just be an example of one of these we

108
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,220
have this thing that's in Mersin TP from

109
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,919
six that's called JWT constraints and

110
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,779
this gets really into no we were just up

111
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:57,329
in aster uses these certain and

112
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,329
passports right passports

113
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:06,910
basic idea negative constrains Jones you

114
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:17,800
just took the mic no it's Mike

115
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:18,250
the switch maybe yeah okay that's a

116
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,019
switch

117
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,790
oh look at the hand that's pretty fancy

118
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:26,889
I can hear the sound of my own voice so

119
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,290
yeah like I said this is kind of in the

120
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,720
weeds of stir but like we have these

121
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,149
passports that are getting signed by

122
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,790
these certificates and these are j2 80

123
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:40,810
based tokens and so we have this concept

124
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:44,589
in RC 82 26 of having a JWT constraints

125
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:48,869
element and what this means on the cert

126
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:51,490
is basically it can dictate which JDO ET

127
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,380
claims you're allowed to insert into one

128
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,060
of these tokens and it kind of occurred

129
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,310
to us it might be handy actually have

130
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,268
the token authority be able to issue

131
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:03,189
those constraints when you know someone

132
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,899
is trying to get a passport I trying to

133
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,370
get a certificate back mean so as a

134
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,750
consequence of that we're still kind of

135
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,399
mulling that there's a particular use

136
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,949
case for it that's associated with our

137
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,870
rich call display draft our CD but our

138
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:16,029
CD is kind of still in flux at the

139
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,529
moment once I think we know where we're

140
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,269
gonna land on that we'll be able to

141
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,759
decide whether we want this JWT

142
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,560
constraints actually be part of the ATC

143
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,740
that we have developed here in the Acme

144
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,569
working group or not and so you know

145
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,100
that that's pending otherwise I think

146
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:32,920
these graphs are in pretty good shape at

147
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,930
this point and so yeah well we'll be

148
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,490
back with that we may do that like later

149
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,290
this week just bang this out and put a

150
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,959
new version into the repository the

151
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,089
issue is stir is like in you know 40

152
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,469
minutes and so we kind of want to see

153
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,269
what's gonna happen there and then then

154
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,699
we'll make a decision about that so

155
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:54,810
that's where we are any questions

156
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:57,490
comments thoughts well I just think that

157
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,258
great if after this term meeting you can

158
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:10,750
send a message to the list saying where

159
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:12,190
we are on this okay okay thank you so

160
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,490
next one who

161
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:49,360
the delegation is Diego in the room yes

162
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:52,030
good okay this is this is a draft that

163
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,820
was created some time ago just a little

164
00:14:52,030 --> 00:15:01,180
bit of history it was created some time

165
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:04,510
ago was a semi we split my request of

166
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,199
the of the group we played the original

167
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:10,150
star mechanism into star only which is

168
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,650
about the request and the way in which

169
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:18,420
searching the identity owner could

170
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:21,520
delegate they use it because thinking of

171
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,280
the scenario of typical scenario of a

172
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,069
CDN the idea that we split 80 at the

173
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:31,990
document into to start this went on its

174
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:33,970
way and is close to be published and the

175
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,070
case of the delegation was part of

176
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,860
another of another document that

177
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,740
originally the group asked us to to go

178
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,600
to sec dispatch to see whether this is

179
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,040
something that belongs to what may or it

180
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,950
was something that to be considering

181
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,920
another in another group they point the

182
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:54,970
conclusion from sex dispatch was to

183
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,910
bounce us back here so here well here we

184
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:02,440
we came some time ago the draft was

185
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,760
adopted and let's interrupt a little bit

186
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,670
about the story because we will talk

187
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,250
about why it was expired basically it

188
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,410
rose about an identity owner that

189
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,140
receives a request for delegation

190
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,110
typically think of a CDN node that wants

191
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,870
to use the certificate for for the

192
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,240
identity owner without exposing private

193
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,520
keys or whatever so what the entity

194
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,660
owner does is precisely request for that

195
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,420
for a four star

196
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:32,430
certificate a temporaries at the

197
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:36,550
temporary certificate using Acme and the

198
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,380
NDC the name delegation client pulls the

199
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,229
certificates a temporary certificates

200
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:44,290
and use it allowing the the identity

201
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,900
owner to revoke them immediately without

202
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,689
sending a revocation but just stopping

203
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:53,590
the the serving Yule this is this is

204
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:57,520
basically the the idea is that well

205
00:16:53,590 --> 00:17:01,120
there is a request that goes with the

206
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,189
see Assad that has to go from the NDC up

207
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,170
to the I do that is the one that makes

208
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,320
the request and and since he at the URL

209
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,610
for pulling the certificates the private

210
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,020
keys never left

211
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:15,939
never leave the be NBC no the any any

212
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,920
private material from the identity on

213
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:22,270
research force is only that the identity

214
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:26,170
owner express as willingness of via of

215
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:28,060
the certificate being generated the

216
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,950
reason this is something that we discuss

217
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,300
or challenges why is important just

218
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,550
another I say this precisely because

219
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,260
typically and NDC and an idea or are

220
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,210
living in different domains and their

221
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:44,410
relationships is not precisely an

222
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:49,180
internal is not well state goes we is

223
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:51,460
true as do office aid is that it has

224
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,470
been expired because and this is our

225
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,070
fault and only or fault of the others

226
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,350
that were much more focus on the main

227
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,290
star draft trying to align with it and

228
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,409
we let the time past simply and we

229
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,090
frankly we failed in making the usual

230
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:12,960
cosmetic update just changing names in

231
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:17,740
numbers on a date as well but we have

232
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,810
formally inspired we had not abandon it

233
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,240
and are buying ongoing discussion with

234
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,610
you currently documented use cases that

235
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,580
one is a steer precisely the other one

236
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:33,129
is the CDN interconnection in which they

237
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,419
are explicitly mentioned the this well

238
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,630
what we are trying to do it most

239
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,300
precisely to understand which other day

240
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,300
the specific requirements

241
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:46,090
well and that's true respect again so

242
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:51,340
this is something that we will solve as

243
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:53,199
soon as we can mr. Sirk delegation

244
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,120
definitely you know we have no real

245
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,130
story about how to do like shortly stuff

246
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,439
with anencephaly I think there is an

247
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,630
overlap I know one constraint that is

248
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,670
unusual for a starship obligation is we

249
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,140
want to be able to narrow the namespace

250
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,330
of these locations was used something

251
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,720
like yeah an accomplishment that you

252
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,649
support that G's is in the list of the

253
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:19,600
things that we have to consider

254
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:21,730
possessing few different categories of

255
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:27,820
identifiers and figuring out how to do

256
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:29,890
encompassing no no it should be I mean

257
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,570
it should be doable I believe it should

258
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:42,690
be doable right now if you look at the

259
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:47,310
at the document is not precisely good

260
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:50,740
okay so there are some open questions is

261
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:54,399
right now zero zero is an adopted zero

262
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:58,360
zero version the message flow we are

263
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,820
reasonably happy with us with it but

264
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:05,320
well whoever is willing to have a look

265
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:08,429
at it and tell us and tell us what he or

266
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:13,389
she thinks it would be really really

267
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:16,020
appreciated now there are a few things

268
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,090
that we have in mind one is about the

269
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,190
composition patterns with the other how

270
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,220
we combine the flow for delegation with

271
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:27,660
the flow for the agree star requirements

272
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,680
once that the ACMA star flow is skia

273
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,020
second is precisely the naming

274
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,230
interactions were John was mentioning

275
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,870
it's about how you narrow or within the

276
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,270
weather than the the way in which you

277
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,239
interact with the identify mapping

278
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:48,010
system DNS is what we have in mind what

279
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,560
probably others how this is the CSR the

280
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,120
CSR that goes from the NDC up to the

281
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,129
idea is validated

282
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,919
I'm going whether we need them more

283
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,170
detail on that and something that has

284
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,560
appeared in interaction with the CDN

285
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,840
guys is whether we need to make to have

286
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,909
a way of publishing and making available

287
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,480
which is a CSR template that is

288
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:13,870
suspected to be used by the baby NDC so

289
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,270
that that's a few reflections initial

290
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,719
reflections about about the different

291
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:22,570
the couple of use cases one is steel and

292
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,570
possess so it is a abstraction from DNS

293
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,899
in that it would be wider in terms of a

294
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:32,980
generic naming Authority and making

295
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,600
because star delegation considers DNS

296
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,250
specific things that we should have to

297
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:43,889
make optional or bring some mapping in

298
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:48,700
the case of a CD an idea is that suppose

299
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:51,040
the the is that there is a upstream CDN

300
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,220
that is delegating some access to a

301
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,930
downstream CDN so it is how would you

302
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:01,000
expose the requirements for the

303
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:02,860
delegation in this in this in the the

304
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,200
requirements for the delegation of the

305
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:08,679
identity in the content allocation

306
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,950
requests and well there are some

307
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,790
concerns at these theories Vivian is not

308
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:19,390
limited is not you may have a chain of

309
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:22,450
here key of delegations and how these

310
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,970
affect something that is such to a

311
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,440
couple of identities and how this

312
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,930
propagates is something that we have to

313
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,000
elaborate the little bits because

314
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:34,500
personally I don't like the idea of a

315
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,540
proxy of proxy of a proxy of a proxy and

316
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:44,590
this is another discussion with the CDN

317
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:47,560
hi guys and as far as I can tell this is

318
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,870
the zone we are where I'm going you will

319
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,190
see a zero one very soon and I hope it

320
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,300
will be a little bit more than a

321
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,900
cosmetic

322
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:03,030
update okay thank you

323
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:13,559
questions we're really running ahead of

324
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:17,240
schedule this planning on me how many

325
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,240
people are planning on reading the spec

326
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:26,400
all right quarter of the room that's

327
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:38,250
pretty good rameneh do how many are plan

328
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:41,750
to implement this they come and then

329
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:51,720
they will just be a CBN I guess at least

330
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:52,890
that's their scroller yeah so I'd like

331
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,000
to hear from some reasoning I'm with

332
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,220
this and make sure that we're actually

333
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:08,940
in their needs and they're such people

334
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:12,690
exist initially put on ice well by what

335
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:15,540
they could lose possessory I mean John

336
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,059
is saying that they this is a speedy

337
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,870
guys in the city and I would make

338
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:31,559
segments or I'll ask them because I

339
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:36,030
wanna meet them all right next

340
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:39,230
okay so next in the agenda oh and this

341
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,230
time it is the fourth tab

342
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,910
Hey so there's a couple use cases were

343
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,200
looking at and primarily around

344
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,420
certificate enrollment for devices for

345
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,170
hardware endpoints and we think Acme can

346
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:07,810
be used to solve a lot of those problems

347
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,760
these cases we recognize and one of the

348
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:12,129
things that will help with the second

349
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,270
main bullet here is Acme can actually be

350
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,030
used for issuance of soft mint

351
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:19,270
certificates this isn't really clear and

352
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,680
obvious from the draft but it's actually

353
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,930
technically allowed from the drafts are

354
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,090
going to go through that and when we use

355
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,640
acne for issuing a soft mint certificate

356
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:30,909
it will just optimize issuing of large

357
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,790
volumes of certificates for clients and

358
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:37,050
devices and some of the use cases were

359
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,790
looking at for a hardware endpoints

360
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:42,490
integration on est integration with

361
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:44,830
brewski integration with t p-- and

362
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,840
integration with TP risky that the thing

363
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:50,530
about EFT Brisky t panting briskly is

364
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,240
these specifications define how the

365
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,740
endpoint connects to the server but none

366
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,660
of them specify how the server connects

367
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,240
to the back end CA whether that server

368
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,120
be eni's tra order that server B at each

369
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,590
server the integration between the

370
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,850
server and the CA is out of scope

371
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,250
there's a couple of related drafts so

372
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,159
recapping cathing have drafts here and

373
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,380
we have had some and these drafts cover

374
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,690
client enrollment and device one first

375
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,860
if could use an acme and we have some

376
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,500
pretty many discussions about alignment

377
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,000
to these three drafts I went to the site

378
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,870
meeting scheduled so anybody who's

379
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,980
interested in using acne for issuing

380
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:30,969
client and device certificates please

381
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,890
attend the site meeting so lots of them

382
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,510
inserts for product remanded if you read

383
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,700
if you read the draft in detail a key

384
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,530
mandates that the identifier in the CSR

385
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,660
must match it and for in the new order

386
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,399
request and the identifier and the

387
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,380
authorization object must be used when

388
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,230
fulfilling HTTP or Tina's challenges

389
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:49,300
Arachne does not mandate is that the

390
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,150
identify new order request matches to

391
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,370
identifier in an authorization object so

392
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:58,090
what this means for a CA if I ca

393
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:00,250
implementing a controls to do so

394
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,030
an acting server could issue

395
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,790
certificates for a subdomain

396
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,800
if declined to only fulfills a challenge

397
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,270
for the parent domain so this is

398
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,649
actually technically allowed by the Acme

399
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,180
draft of ran through this is Richard

400
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,700
this way Richards on the co-authors and

401
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,740
we think this is an interesting use case

402
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,530
if an ACME C is willing to allow a

403
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,710
policy like this and so what that would

404
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,720
mean is that an ACME client could prove

405
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,150
ownership fulfill a challenge for a

406
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,470
parent domain and then issue a larger

407
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,230
number of client certificates or

408
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,180
subdomains of that parent domain which

409
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:36,680
is a nice optimization it reduces all

410
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:38,360
DNS of traffic and challenges so what

411
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,670
this culture looks like for supplemental

412
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,110
pre-authorization and on the left hand

413
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,440
side with the standard floor for

414
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,790
pre-authorization of parent domain and

415
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,640
declined post the new authorization

416
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,170
endpoint and if you run through the

417
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,060
steps there it's straight out yacking

418
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,710
standard and the client just proves

419
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,560
ownership a for parents to me in the

420
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,000
example that given this domain calm and

421
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,250
there's nothing the draft that precludes

422
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
step two happening and step two you is

423
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:07,250
the client issues a new order request

424
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,230
for a subdomain of that previously

425
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,830
challenged fulfilled parent domain and

426
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:15,170
the Acme server can fulfill that order

427
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:18,379
an issue a certificate because there was

428
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:20,690
no text in the Acme draft to prevent

429
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:25,430
that use case and from talking to

430
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:27,710
Richard that is deliberate ever trying

431
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,480
to devise certificate integrations est

432
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,310
which risky diverges defines the

433
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,010
protocol the client used to mollify

434
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:37,450
exchanging pkc as ten and seven payloads

435
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:40,490
with a nice tra and teeth and

436
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:42,440
deliberately bridges and defines a

437
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,050
protocol where clients can roll over a

438
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,330
teep server and by exchanging because he

439
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:51,740
is ten and because he is seven payloads

440
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:53,629
and what draft we have actually neither

441
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,880
das to draft specify how the t p--

442
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,930
server should integrate over the CA or

443
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,730
how the e or EST or a sorry the EST or a

444
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:04,010
integrated to see either a theft auto's

445
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,410
culpable drafts so what this draft we

446
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,570
have here does illustrate so Acme can be

447
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,240
used as a glue to integrate between the

448
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:13,990
est array and an acme server RT p--

449
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,030
server and acne and

450
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,130
not well this book may not be strictly

451
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,410
true no changes our party is TT for

452
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,790
acting specifications we think that the

453
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,679
teach standard is actually under

454
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:27,730
specified at the moment and the teach

455
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,290
standard doesn't really deal with how

456
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,059
the tip server should react and how the

457
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,780
client should react if the tip server is

458
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:36,850
not able to fulfill that because he is

459
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,620
10 requests straight away there's no

460
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,600
back off mechanism doesn't all the retry

461
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,389
mechanism so he believed the tip is

462
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,559
currently under specified and the

463
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,720
subdomain proposal is a nice

464
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,059
optimization it reduces to round trips

465
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,140
that would be required if you're using

466
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:54,850
Acme for certificate issuance sort of

467
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,250
the for client use case is the only one

468
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,050
I've documented here is the use tqi

469
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,990
opinion these culturals were taken

470
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,210
straight from the draft on the left-hand

471
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,020
side to step on the pre-authorization of

472
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,179
the parent domain

473
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,410
it's all very standard than the example

474
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,720
of given as pre-authorization of

475
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,670
domain.com and on the right hand side

476
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,890
home showing his de client interaction

477
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:17,950
with the east tra and the client just

478
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:20,679
sends a standard D is T central DRA DRA

479
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,970
replies were to attend to or to retry

480
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,860
after and this is the bit that's missing

481
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,770
from t p-- there's no retry after an t

482
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:29,740
p-- and the east tra then turns around

483
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,940
and placed a acme order and what you

484
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,100
will notice here is on the left hand

485
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,530
side the pre-authorization involves an

486
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,360
interaction with dns but for actual

487
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,559
certissue ins there's no interaction

488
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,139
with TS there's no authorization

489
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,730
challenges required and for issuing a

490
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,750
certificate should be faster and should

491
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:49,300
be more scalable and once the acme

492
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:52,929
server is issued the certificate to the

493
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,940
RA and after the client that we trained

494
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,580
for this has expired the client should

495
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,870
also simply unroll and retry and then

496
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:03,189
the RA can just issue the search

497
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:05,409
straight to the client then so that's it

498
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,030
really short presentation and pretty

499
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,210
simply use cases for interesting use

500
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,830
cases so the two main things won't stock

501
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,200
what as one is to solve the menus case

502
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,240
of interest to acne series and if it is

503
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,650
is it what formely documenting because

504
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,800
it's currently allowed by the acme

505
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:22,150
traffic but it's not immediately obvious

506
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,120
and our de client and device use cases

507
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,860
of interest to any other implementers so

508
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,639
a version of this presentation is going

509
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,729
to be given that

510
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,900
amuse in you sessions as well and we

511
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,430
have the side meeting on Wednesday

512
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,100
mornings so anybody who's just please

513
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:40,770
come to the second meeting mr. morning

514
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:43,060
that's it Wednesday morning sir

515
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,430
Kathleen Moriarty I do think this is

516
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:49,350
worth documenting just from talking to

517
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:53,380
people who are looking at implementing

518
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:57,010
when they see that these gaps exist they

519
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,500
can feel that it's not ready right even

520
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:07,240
though you can do these things so I do

521
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:11,170
think this is worthwhile develop does it

522
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,730
definitely yes I mean so know the years

523
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:16,540
that we were discussing were talking

524
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:20,710
about the delegations precisely whether

525
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:22,899
it would be it would throw words people

526
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,290
say subdomains and we were like to

527
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,290
simplify

528
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,779
[Music]

529
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:48,260
ranked rants levy Google so the value in

530
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,690
the subdomain just working is valuable

531
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,600
in that it aligns with public see Asians

532
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,520
I don't want to suggest that hacking is

533
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,260
only intended for public CAS but it is a

534
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,960
nice side effect which is that a public

535
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,490
CA has to follow baseline requirements

536
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,460
of recurrence and this is an existing

537
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,680
pattern that many CAS using can use so

538
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,650
there's value in documenting it the only

539
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,780
caveat I throw out there is that in a

540
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,450
world of increased automation which is a

541
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,980
desirable world of reduced life time for

542
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,930
certificates across the board in the

543
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:21,080
industry and again I'm only speaking

544
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:24,260
about public certificates or private

545
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,570
ticket it's not is this maybe profiled

546
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,310
out in a future point rank which is

547
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,290
there there's value in actually having

548
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:33,409
the domain authentication bound to the

549
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,510
specific domain so it's possible and I

550
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,150
say this on the order of many years you

551
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:40,129
know that this gets profile out in terms

552
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,320
of public see days but I don't think

553
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,720
that precludes documenting it now as

554
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,340
this one's with public practice this can

555
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,050
be used for a number of interesting use

556
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:51,199
cases when you're using acting with some

557
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:53,840
of these other use cases so that's just

558
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,480
a caveat that I put out there is that it

559
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,919
may be that in the future Acme

560
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,560
implementations being used for public

561
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,540
CAS don't use this feature and so any

562
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,780
documentation it would be useful to at

563
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:08,320
least keep in mind that we made profiler

564
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,320
sure

565
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,709
okay so anybody specifically interested

566
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,599
in the client entice these cases please

567
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:29,290
attend the site meeting on Wednesday

568
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:33,169
Thanks okay and that brings us to Alexey

569
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:40,909
this was really planned for 11:00 and as

570
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:42,109
I said our agenda is shrinking right

571
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:43,760
this time

572
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:47,359
I only updated one of the documents

573
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,940
which is s/mime I think this is getting

574
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,389
closer to being done

575
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,800
next slide so just don't mind people

576
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:58,430
what this is trying to do this is

577
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,280
basically to be able to issue ex-prime

578
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:05,299
certificates for and user for email

579
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,330
addresses the way it works is that the

580
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,700
challenge is sent in an email in the

581
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:14,230
subject of email that can be verified as

582
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:17,629
coming from their Akhmatova

583
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:21,290
email client is a document client itself

584
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:23,619
or it can invoke Hockman client you know

585
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:27,040
maybe it's a special media type can be

586
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:29,930
music might be able to do this manually

587
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,440
then the responses sent with the

588
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:40,419
response part and then Acme server can

589
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,420
issue a certificate voice my abuse so I

590
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:45,680
sort of had a lot of you know open

591
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,880
issues in the document about how you

592
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,069
verify that email is challenging mail is

593
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,060
coming from a cui server how you

594
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:58,430
verified response and there was also

595
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,930
some questions about specific email

596
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:06,319
details about format and I was trying to

597
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:08,240
balance about between making it very

598
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,470
simple to implement for email clients

599
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,240
but also trying to make it usable for

600
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:19,390
wide variety of existing email clients

601
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:22,520
and existing libraries so this time I

602
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:25,279
drill down more into email format for

603
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,730
challenges and responses

604
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,490
mostly syntactic elements I did some

605
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,980
tests about putting long strings and

606
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,810
subjects and how they will be encoded by

607
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:42,590
existing email clients or web services

608
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:47,360
and yeah basically because of polling

609
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:49,610
length limits in our email specs it's

610
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,460
likely that subject line is going to be

611
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:55,280
folded it means that encoded-word

612
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,630
specification has to be used so I

613
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,850
initially didn't want to use it but I

614
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,940
think it's unavoidable so basically IRC

615
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:05,360
twenty to thirty one needs to be used

616
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:08,660
but this is unlimited to utf-8 Oh us a

617
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:14,750
sketch char sets so we don't want people

618
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:20,680
to require to implement various other

619
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:28,190
things and then yeah similar thing for

620
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:29,870
responses and then basically there was a

621
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,830
man in this discussion about how do you

622
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:36,950
actually verify that email challenge is

623
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:39,860
coming from Acme server and tradition

624
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,839
two ways of doing this an email is a the

625
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,700
dekum signing because the challenge

626
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:47,840
itself in the subject so you want to

627
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:51,230
sign that it's coming from from address

628
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:53,210
associated with the Acme server assigned

629
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:59,450
the subject and few other header fields

630
00:37:53,210 --> 00:38:03,440
or you can use as mine signing with the

631
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:05,540
responses is more difficult because you

632
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,040
don't want to use s mine for responses

633
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,440
because the whole point of this is to

634
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,950
get a smile too difficult to be able to

635
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,840
do that among other things so for

636
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,120
responses is probably just Hakeem

637
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:20,470
signing and make sure that SPF and de

638
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:27,250
mark and various other things in use

639
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:27,250
work right next slide

640
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:34,250
yeah I got a couple of questions last

641
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,349
week

642
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,820
I'm sorry I didn't reply to email all

643
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:43,580
those later

644
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:45,260
hopefully today one question was the

645
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:50,799
document currently says the responses

646
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:54,590
need to use re colon space prefix and

647
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:58,540
suggestion was to allow any prefix not a

648
00:38:54,590 --> 00:39:01,580
big deal I the way purist and me says

649
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,470
the only client that generates non re

650
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,450
prefixes old version of Outlook that

651
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:08,750
should be banished from the surface of

652
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:14,660
the earth if there are other clients

653
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:16,369
doing this I'm curious to know but you

654
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,740
know at the end of the day this is not a

655
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:20,540
big deal it's the change is going to be

656
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,660
whether you compare the whole string but

657
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,910
see you compare suffix of itself I mean

658
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:38,359
in computer terms it makes no huge motor

659
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:40,368
difference the other question was I was

660
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:42,200
struggling a bit with you know how

661
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:45,410
simple the structure of challenge and

662
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:50,980
response e-mails can be original I just

663
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:53,930
said it's it's to explain messages where

664
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,910
for the challenge the challenge itself

665
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:59,000
is on the subject of email so text plan

666
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,279
is just explanatory note for response is

667
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,140
risk response itself actually contains

668
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,330
the response part so I was trying to

669
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,930
balance whether you know do you want to

670
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:14,950
require Acme clients to be full email

671
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:18,290
clients you know to allow multi-part mix

672
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:20,149
or maybe allow you know nice HTML text

673
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,160
to be included explaining what you do

674
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:24,320
with this challenge how you can handle

675
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,180
it manually if you your client doesn't

676
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,859
support like me as my automatically but

677
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:37,879
you know the user can be instructed how

678
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:40,630
to do this still open to suggestions one

679
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,089
suggestion was also to use spam like

680
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:47,330
encoding inside to explain so like sort

681
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:49,328
of for certificates and various other

682
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:52,459
objects

683
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:53,900
yeah again depending on your API in your

684
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:59,660
client libraries that might be

685
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:02,719
convenient I personally prefer to tag

686
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:06,109
challenges and responses and you as

687
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:09,739
extra media types which allows to invoke

688
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:12,440
external applications automatically and

689
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:17,299
it's slightly easier for email clients

690
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:20,150
to to key off to do automatic action but

691
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:22,160
again this is the grand scheme of things

692
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,299
it doesn't matter but we just need to

693
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,299
make a choice and move on

694
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:35,259
think next slide so this is a list of

695
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:38,209
mal standing issues I dealt with

696
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:40,819
challenge verification I need to do a

697
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:43,609
bit more work on response verification

698
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:45,249
and again there is still a little bit of

699
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:49,489
open issue about structure of their

700
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:52,430
challenges and responses so more

701
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:56,779
feedback from the mailing list would be

702
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:58,969
useful I think probably one more

703
00:41:56,779 --> 00:42:01,249
revision and this can go to Alice Cole

704
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:03,890
and then we can I can try to ping

705
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:05,988
various people who who can provide more

706
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:13,999
feedback on you know the structure of

707
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:14,930
the message and ok so not as a chair but

708
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,779
if someone who gets a lot of

709
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,609
international mail I see aw all the time

710
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:22,489
so going back to the prefixes slide I

711
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:27,140
think maybe just to use the subject line

712
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:30,979
being a suffix is the best yeah a lot of

713
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,348
ITF right yes I see Ari : aw : or e :

714
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:39,859
you know I know if this is that old

715
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:53,509
outlook maybe it's just old outlook but

716
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:56,140
ok ok ask the audience who's going to

717
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:56,140
implement this

718
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:20,220
has will thinking about mr. Dale can't

719
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,080
go more from the ACLU so there's

720
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,580
different parts of implementation right

721
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,529
so one part about being mail user agent

722
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,560
implementers who would be willing to do

723
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,930
this if there was a site that's willing

724
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,370
to do it yeah so if there's a CA that's

725
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:45,919
willing to do this then yeah we'll have

726
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:45,920
this to a million thank you

727
00:43:52,599 --> 00:44:13,210
okay Kathleen you're up okay

728
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:18,049
so from the last meeting I split out the

729
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:22,009
the one draft I had into two so the

730
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:26,499
basis of this one is just to set a few

731
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:29,749
new challenge types for user

732
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:32,569
authentication focus and that could be

733
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:36,709
for code signing certificates operating

734
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:40,400
within a process where you establish an

735
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:42,650
account first with the CA and then you

736
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,869
get credentials to use for that

737
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:51,589
pre-authorization challenge and so I'm

738
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:56,299
proposing one time password key pairs

739
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:58,009
like a phyto account be set up or other

740
00:44:56,299 --> 00:44:59,960
certificates be issued for that

741
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:05,210
pre-authorization so what happens with a

742
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:08,480
code signing certificate is the request

743
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:11,480
goes in and there is a challenge sent

744
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:17,049
back in for eg certificates - typically

745
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:20,450
to administrators within within the

746
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:26,869
account and this would be used for that

747
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:29,989
authorization so I did get some email

748
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:33,559
and private conversations after the last

749
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:36,529
talk and not what not I think crickets

750
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:39,410
on the list right but I did get a bunch

751
00:45:36,529 --> 00:45:43,220
in private so I don't know if people are

752
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:44,690
ready to do this yet or if they like or

753
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,029
so so this is the first time I have

754
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,410
these three in there last I was just

755
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:50,779
trying to see who is interested so I

756
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:53,660
actually did get some interest is anyone

757
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:58,700
in the room here interested in adding

758
00:45:53,660 --> 00:46:01,640
these challenge types okay I do have

759
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,169
other people okay so at least one and I

760
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,569
do have other people interested which is

761
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:11,190
okay at least to

762
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:12,510
three okay and I do have other people

763
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,660
that were interested and I don't know if

764
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,800
any of you are the ones means there was

765
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,240
somebody I didn't know that had

766
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,130
contacted me I mean should I just will

767
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:28,379
have to sit a while longer and see if

768
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:33,540
interest grows people not ready for it

769
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:36,090
they don't like it okay thank you

770
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,680
all right so that's at least four and

771
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:48,030
with the interest of four is that

772
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:50,879
implementors yes okay so all right and I

773
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,270
have other people is why I'm standing up

774
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,040
here

775
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:56,430
all right so okay all right good thank

776
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,650
you

777
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,680
so please send comments and feedback

778
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:05,910
okay by the way it's Thomas for snotty

779
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:23,390
under the that was nothing the job of

780
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:33,240
expressing interest thank you Mary um

781
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:35,069
this is the first great excellent thank

782
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,439
you yeah I'd appreciate any feedback or

783
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,990
if there are types that I missed that

784
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,320
should be incorporated as well I didn't

785
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:52,609
put too much time into this because I

786
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:59,760
wanted to get interest look cool alright

787
00:47:52,610 --> 00:48:02,790
next one so I split out these two drafts

788
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,580
after a message from Richard Barnes and

789
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:07,650
some conversations with Owen and we have

790
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:10,500
to sort out like what we should do with

791
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:12,510
all of these drafts I just want to go to

792
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,390
the next slide so when I talk about this

793
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:18,299
work people just see the let's encrypt

794
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:20,038
work and the RFC

795
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:23,160
eight five five five and they get lots

796
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,779
of I've gotten lots of questions that of

797
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,109
things I think Owen head said this

798
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:30,329
things that you can do with acne but

799
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:32,400
it's not clear from the draft and then

800
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:36,929
people are hesitant to go forward

801
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:41,759
because they think it has to fit in with

802
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:45,449
the realm of what let's encrypt does so

803
00:48:41,759 --> 00:48:46,979
this would be informational I think we

804
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:49,619
have to sort out maybe in the Wednesday

805
00:48:46,979 --> 00:48:53,189
meeting what Doc's go where or here

806
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:54,929
ideally but what's useful are there

807
00:48:53,189 --> 00:48:57,660
other questions that need to be answered

808
00:48:54,929 --> 00:49:00,599
that other people are getting like I get

809
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:03,359
ones like okay where can you store the

810
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:07,019
keys and it's orthogonal right so you

811
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:12,630
could use pkcs 11 but it doesn't say it

812
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:13,618
anywhere in RFC a five five five I know

813
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:16,920
I know

814
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:22,619
John John's face yeah yes it should be

815
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:24,029
obvious but apparently it's not right

816
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,009
and then there was long mailing list

817
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:28,079
discussions on things like comparing it

818
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:29,009
to esthe but that wasn't captured and

819
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,959
you have to go back and read a mailing

820
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:34,859
list so I've gotten lots of questions on

821
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:37,439
that and then being able to use a

822
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:39,299
challenge type for a different type of

823
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:44,729
certificate you know you just have to

824
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:46,859
change the the CSR and it has a

825
00:49:44,729 --> 00:49:50,669
different cert type but that's not

826
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:51,900
obvious either so yeah some of this

827
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:55,469
might be silly

828
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:59,839
is it worth documenting and improving

829
00:49:55,469 --> 00:50:03,989
this or as an informational draft or not

830
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:05,578
what do people think I'm happy but this

831
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:14,809
I didn't put a lot of time into yet I

832
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:17,329
there so it can be much improved but I

833
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:20,609
think the more we want people to

834
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:23,880
implement encryption on PKI

835
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:25,529
as an infrastructure as a default the

836
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,150
more we can do to reduce obstacles to

837
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:32,240
that adoption the better so favor

838
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:34,490
Seldon explain crypto to sympathy for

839
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,720
anyone okay great so comments and

840
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:40,399
feedbacks to improve it would be

841
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,890
appreciated yeah I mean this is like

842
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,940
interesting material I think rc-- seems

843
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,129
like an odd way to do it they're gonna

844
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,720
have an import questions that people are

845
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:50,299
going to have it's like a fax kind of

846
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,859
it's more needed here also remember what

847
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:53,029
a little sort of sad about the material

848
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:55,190
in here this you're like why not ask

849
00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:56,539
that seems like like I think you did

850
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,430
what he sidestepped those questions in

851
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:00,799
the working group and like I'm sort of

852
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,180
watch into it like like I find another

853
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:04,759
you sure explain why did you perform I

854
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:08,118
end up were to go be be or sad and like

855
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:09,529
I don't think you had that funny yeah so

856
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,869
it was answered on the mailing list in

857
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:14,450
detail but people who aren't feeling

858
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:16,130
following mailing list aren't seeing

859
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:21,499
that so it's just stuff that I've been

860
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:23,180
asked yes I've read the draft segment

861
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:25,899
there's some useful stuff in here some

862
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:29,749
stuff that yeah maybe

863
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,920
history but I don't see why this needs

864
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:32,839
to be an emergency it all it doesn't

865
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,730
need the consensus is the IETF it

866
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,529
doesn't need permanent archive ability I

867
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,950
think this would make a fine blog post

868
00:51:36,529 --> 00:51:42,859
or a series of blog posts that doesn't

869
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:45,558
okay so something being found I think is

870
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:47,150
is the importance like I have some

871
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:50,119
working groups where I go back to

872
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:53,059
documents and I have to pull out a draft

873
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:55,099
that's been expired and you know this

874
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:58,579
goes back over a decade where I have

875
00:51:55,099 --> 00:52:02,390
ones that I do that for that's the fun

876
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:05,239
thing that logs expire they can

877
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:09,140
disappear without notice and in RFC Camp

878
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:15,890
a site can go away these are these are

879
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:18,470
archived so archival value no hats so a

880
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:21,828
few years ago and I fused probably about

881
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:28,689
2/10 and I that is a canoe group had

882
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:28,690
this exact roadmap or FC that documented

883
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:34,180
so that is published and I don't think

884
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:38,140
is there a way to know that though

885
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:46,640
there is some value in this my opinion

886
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:48,680
but I don't know it's a lot of value

887
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,900
alright so if there's some place where

888
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,549
it's not gonna just disappear like just

889
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:57,499
some random blog post I've had blogs

890
00:52:52,549 --> 00:53:00,140
disappear questions I'm gonna add one

891
00:52:57,499 --> 00:53:01,970
for him do we know whether anyone's

892
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,979
reading it or using it I can't say using

893
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:13,069
it but if we implement the web analytics

894
00:53:03,979 --> 00:53:16,749
on the idea that's just say individual

895
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:16,749
here I did not read the draft is

896
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,868
clickability

897
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:25,970
I mean this is just answering general

898
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:28,210
questions like so it's all over the map

899
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,209
right now

900
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:34,999
French aha fortunately I want to say

901
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:37,479
that when I read this draft I think that

902
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:39,890
it is useful for me to understand the

903
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:43,399
history of how to use these kind of

904
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:46,009
things as a new guys for this area yeah

905
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,339
it's really useful and I personally

906
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:52,009
think about the question of whether it's

907
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:52,400
to the PRC or the kind of way to publish

908
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:56,119
it

909
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,829
I think because I think that maybe this

910
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,259
drafter you have talked about or you

911
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:04,759
described about something about how to

912
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:07,430
use eme and together with the Brisky oh

913
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:11,450
yes the other kind of technology to

914
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:14,808
provide a whole process of the device or

915
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:18,649
the of the users auto provision right so

916
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:22,460
I think these kind of things is not just

917
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:26,719
some guidance it's just like Roman

918
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:28,489
nation maybe saw applicability document

919
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:33,079
or some kind of thing so I think this

920
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:36,650
makes sense to be a document standard to

921
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:38,779
clarify how to use it a different kind

922
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:44,329
of time technology combined together

923
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:47,239
right I think that is useful so the last

924
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:50,059
question inside is that I'm wondering

925
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:51,740
whether this document has included a

926
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:55,680
part of the

927
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:58,529
the certificated provision for the

928
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,960
networked device for exam or whether we

929
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:04,500
to talk about about the revelation with

930
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,230
the I Triple E a to the arrow to thought

931
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,150
a to talk about they are it's kind of

932
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:12,120
certificate how would you say I say I

933
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:15,690
need to probation unit yet so I was

934
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,339
aiming it at informational I you think

935
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,710
from the feedback I'm getting I'm happy

936
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,360
to aerate this again as a draft even if

937
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,530
it's not a working group draft and we

938
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,480
can figure out where it gets published

939
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:27,170
as it iterates so if you want to help

940
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,000
add that information please share and

941
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:32,940
and we'll get it incorporated and we'll

942
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,670
see how this develops if it develops

943
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:39,780
into you know something more or not

944
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:44,910
maybe gets published a different way but

945
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:55,020
I'll iterate it in a draft for now the

946
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:59,190
drafts are cheap so a lot of times I've

947
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:01,230
seen RFC's called use cases maybe not

948
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:12,870
overviews yeah that's not popular though

949
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:15,950
so you expand acne Navy you're expanding

950
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:18,509
the scope it right you use cases more

951
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:20,069
well I don't I don't know I can see the

952
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:23,580
value to having you know here's the

953
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:27,990
possible ways you can do this where you

954
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:34,370
put it as you say as long as it's

955
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:34,370
persistent right that's my worry for me

956
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:44,109
Alexei Melnikov I suggest the Working

957
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,240
Girl if there is enough interest

958
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:48,130
adopters as a work item with

959
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,339
understanding it might not be published

960
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:53,790
as an arty and just do it as a working

961
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:56,109
your process and then you figure out

962
00:56:53,790 --> 00:57:00,130
what to do with it later on whether it's

963
00:56:56,109 --> 00:57:03,549
you know wiki blog post you know RFC or

964
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:05,200
not you know content so when I'm fine

965
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:07,359
with that because then even the the

966
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,399
draft will always be there even if it

967
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:12,880
doesn't get published so we have that

968
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:16,060
stickiness of that because the archival

969
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,560
properties hi I mean Susan you had a

970
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,849
perfectly consistent with it being usual

971
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,020
individual traffic like what you

972
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:25,050
potentially dock you for like working

973
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:25,050
group work it's not playing RC even like

974
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,980
other groups do it yeah okay

975
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,618
Virginia I mean I think it's for

976
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,720
whatever the word enough wants to do so

977
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:45,250
they're interested yes and if anyone

978
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,950
send me feedback I will update it

979
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:50,500
regardless of its status so I'm happy to

980
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:58,240
grow this or let it die based on

981
00:57:50,500 --> 00:58:00,609
feedback tears are you ready to have the

982
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,759
working group think decide now or you

983
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:05,500
want to do another drafter it doesn't

984
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,030
matter to me I mean I'll continue to

985
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,950
work on it based on feedback but what do

986
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:10,660
you guys think you're the chairs well I

987
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:18,399
think that the first question would be

988
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:20,680
how many people have read the draft well

989
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:27,490
enough to fill a table to restaurant

990
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:31,359
yeah tomorrow yeah so um I don't see

991
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:35,490
really a good case for asking whether

992
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:37,660
people want to want to adopt this now so

993
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:39,879
encourage people to read this and

994
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:43,259
perhaps next time or on the mailing list

995
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:46,030
we can decide whether this ought to be a

996
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:48,010
the workman draft that's discussed in

997
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,750
the working group or an individual drugs

998
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:52,690
that is discussed in the working group

999
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:55,480
so either way

1000
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:58,690
I don't think there's any decision that

1001
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:01,110
were that we can make right now all

1002
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,110
right thank you

1003
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:10,930
that's most of what we have on our

1004
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:13,090
agenda except for their way forward and

1005
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:17,339
open mic also known as any other

1006
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:20,410
business so about this way forward thing

1007
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:22,930
the way it looks from here is that we're

1008
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:26,440
discussing a lot of very poorly read

1009
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:28,419
probably reviewed drafts that well

1010
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,820
there's not a lot of interest and for

1011
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:35,560
many of them the people who are might

1012
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:37,540
want to implement them are not in the

1013
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:41,080
room not in the not in the list and

1014
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:42,970
there's somebody that comes to Acme to

1015
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,920
write the draft because some other group

1016
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:48,040
needs it and the rest of the group

1017
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:51,190
doesn't really engage in Mack he doesn't

1018
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:53,860
come to the meetings and the question is

1019
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:56,590
do we really need a working group to do

1020
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:58,300
that I mean is this either is there any

1021
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:01,000
advantage of having an active working

1022
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,770
group when what we're doing here isn't

1023
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,810
of interest to the people in the room to

1024
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:06,340
the people on the mailing list except

1025
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:09,520
for that one or two people coming from

1026
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:12,910
another group to do some acting work for

1027
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:15,220
their group so the question is do we

1028
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,770
want to be always be closing this

1029
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,509
working group or doing one team or do

1030
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:21,160
you think that there's any actual work

1031
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:24,130
that the working group is going to do

1032
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,680
rather than just sitting here reading

1033
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:30,480
our email well somebody from another

1034
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:34,870
group comes to the mic and tell us what

1035
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:46,840
what they need so this really has to go

1036
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:49,080
in the mic we could probably put this

1037
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:53,250
group on kind of glide path supposing

1038
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,250
seem like we've got a couple of kinds

1039
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:59,170
there seems to be reaching a natural

1040
01:00:55,930 --> 01:01:01,419
ending point I think there's not there

1041
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:03,100
shouldn't be a real great need for this

1042
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:05,079
group to stay open long term unless he

1043
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,719
needs to make tweaks to acne

1044
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:09,640
I think defining you identifier testify

1045
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:12,249
challenge types can be done in different

1046
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:18,658
groups and extended by the IRS Jews need

1047
01:01:12,249 --> 01:01:18,658
to find always be closing

1048
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,559
[Music]

1049
01:01:21,269 --> 01:01:25,678
Kathleen Moriarty I I think there's

1050
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:29,409
value in at least getting the client

1051
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:33,069
pieces forward just to round it out and

1052
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:35,739
have acne more full and and presented

1053
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:39,249
out externally as more than just for web

1054
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:41,289
certificates right so I'm sure that

1055
01:01:39,249 --> 01:01:44,439
anything that we've already accepted

1056
01:01:41,289 --> 01:01:46,809
should move forward and we done that but

1057
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:48,279
we could go into the kind of closing

1058
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:50,739
State where we're not taking any new

1059
01:01:48,279 --> 01:01:53,019
stuff because as long as we stay open

1060
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:54,969
people are going to come and have this

1061
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:57,069
new little extension that they want to

1062
01:01:54,969 --> 01:02:04,119
we're never gonna we're gonna be like

1063
01:01:57,069 --> 01:02:06,279
the old pickax we have some drafts in

1064
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:08,469
flight that are adopted we have some

1065
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:10,630
drafts that are not yet adopted what

1066
01:02:08,469 --> 01:02:13,269
we've talked about is there any body of

1067
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:14,799
work that has not come a draft warm to

1068
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:15,968
the working group that we would want to

1069
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:19,149
put in the table that would necessitate

1070
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:20,939
us continuing the work so I guess I'm

1071
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:23,380
asking another evening is everything

1072
01:02:20,939 --> 01:02:26,138
it's or all the traps that we would

1073
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:30,179
think about kind of advancing they all

1074
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:30,179
the tables there's something else I said

1075
01:02:37,529 --> 01:02:41,859
hi this is entrenar own from my

1076
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:43,899
historical perspective and you mentioned

1077
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:45,249
pickax like it took like 18 years to

1078
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:46,989
close it if you have something that's

1079
01:02:45,249 --> 01:02:48,999
open it's about PKI it will stay open

1080
01:02:46,989 --> 01:02:50,019
into the closest so if you've got things

1081
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:51,788
and you think you're good to go and

1082
01:02:50,019 --> 01:02:54,788
close it start on another working group

1083
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:56,469
it doesn't take that much time so we

1084
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:58,209
charter do whatever I mean there's all

1085
01:02:56,469 --> 01:03:00,099
kinds of ways to do this I think you're

1086
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:01,299
things that me are good if there are

1087
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:03,130
things that come along that are like

1088
01:03:01,299 --> 01:03:05,380
additional explanations we have SEC

1089
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:09,839
dispatched if it's clearly bad evident

1090
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:09,839
the ATS can sponsor or not it's

1091
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:17,780
Aleksey monocle whatever you do just

1092
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:19,369
don't close the meaning list I think you

1093
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:21,500
want to keep the men in this town so

1094
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:23,960
people can at least ask questions and

1095
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,890
bring ideas then you can redirect them

1096
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,960
elsewhere

1097
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:40,910
mail is including the pickax one are

1098
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:46,160
open forever of course so any other

1099
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:58,868
business we've got a lot of your life

1100
01:03:46,160 --> 01:04:05,690
back and we may not see you in Singapore

1101
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:09,400
and you do need the blue sheets back if

1102
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:09,400
you haven't signed them do so now
