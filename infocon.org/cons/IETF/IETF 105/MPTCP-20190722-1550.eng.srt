1
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,380
yeah

2
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,298
they got maybe I like him

3
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:58,500
should we stop yeah Jamal begs you dude

4
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,530
hello everyone welcome to multipath TCP

5
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,670
thank you all very much coming do feel

6
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:14,040
free we've got an extremely large room

7
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,040
so feel free to snuggle up the front I

8
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,160
think this is the biggest room we've

9
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,160
ever had can you close a door behind

10
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,960
thank you very much to Michael for

11
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:33,100
taking the notes I guess you'll be doing

12
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,909
them in the ether pad yeah so if if

13
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,380
anybody wants to help out because you

14
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,960
can collaborate and that that would be

15
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:47,979
very good is somebody able to monitor

16
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:52,479
the jabber room please I bet that people

17
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:54,880
still use jabber / anybody able to

18
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,310
monitor it I guess we'll run yo she'll

19
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,460
try and leap and honor when you come to

20
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,160
the mic please remember to say your name

21
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:06,159
perfectly slowly so that the note-taker

22
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:10,120
can know who you are and everybody else

23
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,090
is here can hear who you are and the

24
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,630
usual remind us about the draft names

25
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,929
the blue sheet is going round I think

26
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:25,300
we're just gonna do one day vocals one

27
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:30,810
will do though I should say I'm I'm

28
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,810
Phillip nerdly and my co-chair is Yoshi

29
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,820
I'm his the usual no well

30
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:47,679
here's our agenda for today first of all

31
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:51,069
just to let you know the status of them

32
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:55,119
of the of our this document SiC the RFC

33
00:05:51,069 --> 00:06:00,249
682 for this the protocol so that has

34
00:05:55,119 --> 00:06:03,489
now completed is G review and Nia has

35
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:06,009
pushed our ad is pushed the button so

36
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:09,578
it's now gone - Ayanna so that that's

37
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:13,089
been a a lot of work are a number of

38
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:16,209
people over quite a period of time so

39
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:20,709
thank you and congratulations to

40
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:24,039
everybody who's made it get that far so

41
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,119
I guess it's bir known the RFC editor

42
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,549
and things and it will actually be

43
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,779
published I personally love that his

44
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:35,109
time so that's sir

45
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:36,969
fantastic is so you can you can see the

46
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,549
rest of the agenda here we've kind of

47
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:44,519
got two bits really we've got some three

48
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:49,659
individual drafts to talk about and

49
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:52,089
we've got a session to to talk about the

50
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:56,050
teacher of potential future topics with

51
00:06:52,089 --> 00:07:00,179
working group so as always we have an

52
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:03,879
open mic or news about implementations

53
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:05,919
what's happening on that with the Linux

54
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,529
implementation or with with any of the

55
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,089
other ones that they're all about so

56
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:12,639
this is kind of the opportunity for

57
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,349
anybody who wants to to say anything

58
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,299
about implementation what's happening

59
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:19,599
what any news there is sometimes we have

60
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:24,578
several pieces of news and sometimes we

61
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:27,808
we don't so just pause to see if anybody

62
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,809
wants anything on us today

63
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,020
okie-doke right let's let's move on with

64
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,830
the with the agenda so we've got some

65
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:48,760
three individual drums we've got first

66
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,650
up is Marcus who's here that's good to

67
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,640
talk about his robust social

68
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,640
establishment work

69
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:27,270
we have the instructions hello my name

70
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,370
is Mark Harmon from Deutsche Telekom and

71
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,320
today I want to talk about multi-part

72
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,500
CCP robust establishment there is

73
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:38,700
something I thought already up at ITF

74
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:41,820
1999 and now I had some time to write it

75
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:47,120
down into a trap and yeah I want to

76
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,120
present the progress since 99

77
00:08:52,280 --> 00:09:07,880
got your okay just to recap what it is

78
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:11,160
about and what the motivation behind so

79
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,100
multiple TCP has this concept of initial

80
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,800
flows which means in the beginning it

81
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,010
starts on one part of the multiple TCP

82
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,870
negotiation and if this is successful

83
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:25,370
then subsequent flows can be established

84
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:28,190
and robust establish minders about

85
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,690
relaxing there's a little bit and

86
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:34,890
introduce the concept of potentially

87
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:37,920
initial flows which means we can use all

88
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:41,640
the paths available in the beginning of

89
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:49,290
a multi-part CCP session to establish

90
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:51,270
multiple TCP as such and that means I I

91
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,959
demand more or less if there is at least

92
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:58,620
one functional path a connection must be

93
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:04,380
possible in the beginning and and you

94
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:07,340
can see what is the effect when the

95
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,170
potential initial flows is applied so

96
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,110
even if the default route which is

97
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,870
usually used to a step to some other

98
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,600
part a TCP connection is somehow block

99
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,140
disrupted whatever then with the

100
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,300
potential initial flow as you can see on

101
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:29,670
the top in the figure it can even be

102
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:32,130
established the detailed motivation you

103
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:38,069
can found in the presentation form I

104
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:45,750
19 home okay what what happened since

105
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:49,430
ITF 99 I published the paper together

106
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:54,449
with the University North London about

107
00:10:49,430 --> 00:11:01,758
the robust establishment and we had a

108
00:10:54,449 --> 00:11:04,319
red elaborated there that the

109
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:08,279
functionality of potential in the

110
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:16,160
initial flows guarantees robust session

111
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:20,610
establishment second it improves the

112
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:25,769
handshake latency especially if there

113
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:28,860
are paths in the game which have which

114
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:31,800
have a faster round to time faster

115
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,660
latency then the default route as I

116
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,029
mentioned which is usually used to

117
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,990
establish a multi-part a TCP connection

118
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:44,009
and third we even had a throughput game

119
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,959
if sap flows are earlier available as it

120
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:48,139
is with the traditional not across the

121
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,138
screen

122
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:55,829
yeah also as I mentioned I published

123
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,269
document describing the multiple TCP

124
00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:03,359
robust establishment and are defining

125
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:06,689
their true concept that is the simple

126
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,319
robust establishment called Roby sim and

127
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:16,230
the extended robust establishment called

128
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:20,910
Roby X and both integrates and consider

129
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:24,540
the feedback which I got at IIT f99 and

130
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:30,060
also under also under nailing this

131
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:33,899
it separates first the functionality of

132
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,939
guaranteeing robustness and which is

133
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,120
part of the simple robust robust

134
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:41,880
establishment and second the latency

135
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,160
throughput improvement if he can really

136
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,300
use all power from the very beginning

137
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,980
and we can

138
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,829
merge the flows that I will explain in

139
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:58,610
in a minute

140
00:12:51,830 --> 00:13:02,670
yeah second the audience mentioned that

141
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:06,180
the key a which was part of the motive

142
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:10,290
power capital option is not available

143
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,900
anymore in multi-party city version one

144
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,990
from the very beginning it is first

145
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,209
available in the last part of the

146
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:22,070
three-way handshake so that is something

147
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:27,830
I had to consider when I designed the

148
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:32,000
Roby xed then there was a hint that

149
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:35,610
robust establishment should not add

150
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,640
extra Orion so ordinary computing

151
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,050
overhead that is especially important if

152
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,189
you talk about the potential Linux

153
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:48,089
implementation yeah and last but not

154
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:53,730
least the robot establishment should

155
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:57,900
have the same authentication level as

156
00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:03,140
multipath TCP as so it should be secure

157
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,140
secured from from attackers and so on

158
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:12,270
yeah now beginning with the robust step

159
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,199
may be simple robust establishment where

160
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:20,220
I've on the left

161
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:24,290
the flow diagram how it works so we have

162
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:27,750
a host a this which is initiating the

163
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:32,579
multipath TCP session and we have a host

164
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:36,900
B which is the server then we try to

165
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:42,090
connect to both our multi path capital

166
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:44,910
and what is U now that also written on

167
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:48,480
the right we initiate the multiple TCP

168
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:52,860
set up sending a multi-part capital

169
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,110
option on all paths that is different to

170
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,540
the traditional multiple TCP which would

171
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,090
only do it on one of the paths and first

172
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,650
after a successful negotiation

173
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:12,420
it would use a multipath channel to add

174
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:16,230
subsequent flows then the path which

175
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:20,160
exists first which means it gets soon

176
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:25,790
ACK from house II is selected as the

177
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:37,770
initial path and the other one is then

178
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:41,689
let me check in step s as a six-o on the

179
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:44,520
bottom it then reset it from the client

180
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:49,680
so that is that is very simple it's a

181
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:53,699
pure client based decision so again we

182
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,890
headed on all park attend the multi-part

183
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,250
capable the first one which succeeds

184
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:02,660
from a client view is selected at the

185
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:06,120
initial part and all the other part are

186
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,959
reset at them and then the traditional

187
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,080
multipath join the procedure can be

188
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:16,170
applied

189
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,420
yeah the pros are it is simple it is the

190
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:22,170
sender side only implementation it is

191
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:27,180
full compliant to multiple TCP version 0

192
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:29,250
and version 1 it guarantees robust

193
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:35,189
session setup at least for multiple TCP

194
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:38,670
version 0 and the setup latency profits

195
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:42,510
from the fastest pass in the game the

196
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:47,040
cons are we are wasting resources when

197
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,840
resetting flows that is obvious and what

198
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,079
we do not solve or that we have some

199
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,720
dependency on that the multiple TCP

200
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:59,970
version 1 is depending on a successful

201
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,040
egg in the three-way handshake that

202
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,760
means the last acknowledgment has to be

203
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,680
successful transmitted and we are

204
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,879
depending on that as well so we are not

205
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,880
solving this that

206
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,750
that has to be happen successfully that

207
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,650
this acknowledgement is surviving at

208
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:24,400
this point if you have a look on the

209
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,870
extended profits establishment then it's

210
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,050
more or less the same in the beginning

211
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:34,090
so we initiate a multipass TCP is set up

212
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:35,770
sending an MP capital on all paths we

213
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,470
select the initial flow based on the

214
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:45,010
fastest path which returned too soon ech

215
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:46,780
so until this point we we are similar to

216
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,750
these simple robust establishment and

217
00:17:46,780 --> 00:18:01,330
then it it changed instead of resetting

218
00:17:49,750 --> 00:18:03,610
the flow east sent in step as a six - we

219
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,409
are sending a multipass joined kept

220
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,070
option that is a new option I will

221
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:12,730
explain the next slide and with that we

222
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:17,139
are able to merge a potential initial

223
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:22,210
flow with the initial flow so that we do

224
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:25,150
not waste the resources that we can use

225
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,780
the effort we already spend to 270

226
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:34,570
multipath level on all paths and we can

227
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:36,280
directly use then so the pros are we

228
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,310
have a robust session set up for of

229
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:45,850
multipath TCP version 0 and version 1

230
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:51,730
even we are not reliant anymore on the

231
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:56,679
final leg of the of the three-way

232
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:59,710
handshake on the initial flow so that

233
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,540
means we can merge potentially the flows

234
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:10,090
to initial flows even if they are not

235
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:14,230
fully established similar to the simple

236
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:18,520
robust establishment we profit from the

237
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:21,460
latency of the fastest path yes and what

238
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,610
is different to this to the symbol

239
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:28,200
robust establishment is that we have

240
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:32,469
very very early all subfloors available

241
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,060
which means we can gain a higher

242
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:39,330
throughput wonder from the very

243
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:44,250
beginning of a session set up the con is

244
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:49,629
it requires a new multiple TCP option

245
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:53,350
called multipath join cap all this looks

246
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:57,780
like can we see in the next slide so on

247
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:03,040
the Left I proposed the option format

248
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:08,940
mainly it includes the key a of the

249
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:14,399
selected initial flow and second H Mac

250
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:18,400
comprising information about TB key a

251
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:28,960
and the key B of the potential initial

252
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:30,370
flow itself so the key a the first

253
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,110
information on the slide and that is

254
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:41,620
very important we assume that we have

255
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:43,659
the same effort on on receiver side yes

256
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:48,939
similar to the multipath Chandra seizure

257
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:54,870
so there is no difference in that the

258
00:20:48,940 --> 00:21:00,880
key a of the option is used to identify

259
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:03,459
related flow so identify which initial

260
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,920
flow and potential energy flows belongs

261
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:16,980
together the key be passed hash which is

262
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:20,260
part of the H Mac is used to make the

263
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:24,630
relationship between potential initial

264
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:27,850
flows and not yet fully established

265
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:31,240
initial flows that what I meant or that

266
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:34,149
is that is related to version 1 of TCP

267
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,210
meant for example the the final leg of

268
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,470
the initial flow hasn't arrived yet then

269
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,450
we can make sure that we

270
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:44,320
the key be fast hash of a potential

271
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:50,019
initial flow you can establish such a

272
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:52,330
flow and we can merge them and the h-net

273
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:56,169
itself so all the other information

274
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:58,449
which is anxiety th- is then used for

275
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:01,960
authentication for identification

276
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:06,159
purposes similar to multi pass capital

277
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:10,269
and multipaths on so that attackers

278
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:14,019
cannot modify the option or can take

279
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:16,929
over paths or sessions of multi pass

280
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:19,539
tsuki the detailed explanation of this

281
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:22,389
can be found found on the mailing list

282
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:27,639
there was already some discussion on

283
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:31,990
that how the the option has to look like

284
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:34,600
and which information need to be inside

285
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:40,629
and it's also passed the part of the

286
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:44,799
trough document so what are the next

287
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:48,459
steps we have an existing Linux

288
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:51,820
prototype where we implement the idea of

289
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,659
potential initial flows into the

290
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,950
multiple TCP reference implementation

291
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,370
unfortunately it is more or less

292
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:04,269
outdated so it's more than two years old

293
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:07,090
and all the changes since ITF 99 the

294
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:08,950
definition of the simple robust

295
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:13,080
establishment and extend the purpose

296
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,519
establishment is not part of that and I

297
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:20,500
recommend an implementation from from

298
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:22,659
scratch so if someone is in the room may

299
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,360
be from a university who is interested

300
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:29,200
in that topic I think this could be a

301
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,658
good work for for a student maybe for

302
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,019
Jesus to implement something like this

303
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:37,779
and to investigate it

304
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:40,750
another point is which which was already

305
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:43,330
brought up on the mailing list is that

306
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:47,049
maybe the signaling especially for the

307
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:50,830
extended progress establishment has to

308
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:51,830
be discussed maybe it requires a 4 Way

309
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,439
handshake 7

310
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:59,120
to the multipath charm and also which is

311
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,520
currently not considered in the draft

312
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,360
just as a section but without any

313
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,889
content how many

314
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:11,600
negotiation or the extended prophecy

315
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:15,820
statement can be made and how potential

316
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,169
fallback mechanism has to look like so

317
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,919
for sure that is that there are things

318
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:25,670
which have to be in discussed and then

319
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,880
in general we have to improve the first

320
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:33,230
draft version we have to integrate such

321
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,240
things like the signalling maybe the

322
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:39,080
four by handshake with negotiation and

323
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,820
fallback mechanisms and integrate this

324
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:46,460
in the next version of the trough

325
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:49,490
document yeah the goal is that it

326
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:55,210
becomes working proof adopted at some

327
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:57,710
time and also I had some discussion with

328
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:05,690
potential of it with interested persons

329
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:09,710
who maybe who maybe support in general

330
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:21,530
ranking the next draft version of the

331
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:24,680
document but feel free to chana's so in

332
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:28,820
the bottom of the slide I have a link to

333
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:34,520
the mailing list itself what I forgot is

334
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:36,919
the link to the git repository where the

335
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,660
trough document is available and bread

336
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:45,950
can be edited so maybe that I will later

337
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:50,060
share on the mailing list so yeah get in

338
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,880
touch with me support us I think it's a

339
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:56,240
it's a very interesting option to extend

340
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,010
the traditional not hostility and there

341
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,140
are a lot of use cases which can profit

342
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,320
from that oh thank you

343
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,770
and feel free to ask now there are some

344
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,770
questions

345
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,870
comments and questions

346
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:31,070
is anyone interested in helping with

347
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:33,020
this work in terms of what your

348
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,149
implementers and grave Christian

349
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:41,629
community at all helping with the date

350
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:45,700
with the design of it what I forgot to

351
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:48,470
mention is one one particular use case

352
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,049
just remind us for example that there

353
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,450
are some discussions of DNS over a TCP

354
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:56,389
or DNS over HTTP

355
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,090
in both cases robust establishment could

356
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:03,799
be something to make the us requests

357
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:06,409
over such protocols more reliable that

358
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,629
is something but also in cases when we

359
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:12,590
thought about multipath connectivity on

360
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:17,750
on smartphones for example that could be

361
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:20,570
something which makes you know the whole

362
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,210
quality of experience much more reliable

363
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,820
much more better because it's often the

364
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:30,169
case that we have may be connected to a

365
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:33,530
Wi-Fi which cannot guarantee a

366
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:37,309
successful TCP establishment or maybe

367
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:39,830
the multiple TCP options are trapped

368
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:42,678
somehow and so that this robust

369
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:46,549
establishment we can make sure that we

370
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,400
can even if there's a buggy Wi-Fi that

371
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:53,990
multicast is PA can be established and

372
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,549
and can use all all the paths and the

373
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,120
restrooms are had a question so you had

374
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:02,179
the two versions of the setup the simple

375
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,449
and extended yeah is one or the other

376
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:09,169
your your main target or I also noticed

377
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:11,600
the the simple one is quite similar in

378
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:13,790
functionality as to what is developed in

379
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,379
the in the taps crew with the transport

380
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,020
services where you have racing between

381
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,330
protocols but would be the same behavior

382
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,000
but it happens one level up as opposed

383
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,230
to inside and to TCP I think the effect

384
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,110
would be very similar

385
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:30,140
Nick yeah that is a good point also

386
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,770
something which was raised from olivier

387
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,640
in the

388
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,120
manning list that there are already

389
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,630
similar

390
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,489
phonology is also the happy eyeball and

391
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,280
I think at least V we should consider

392
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:47,020
this in the trough that there that they

393
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:51,290
are similar functional he is available

394
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:53,780
but maybe it is good to have something

395
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:55,490
at least described directly in the

396
00:28:53,780 --> 00:29:01,250
multiple TCP contacts and I'm not

397
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:05,390
familiar with the taps functionality so

398
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:08,660
I have to convert it it taps basically

399
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,840
analyzes happy eyeballs also on doing

400
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,850
racing on yeah not only on ipv4 ipv6 but

401
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,550
also on protocols and interface yeah

402
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,620
yeah at least we need a section in the

403
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,570
trust which considers such such

404
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,669
functions well of course the extended

405
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:26,120
modus is different trying because that's

406
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:28,580
I mean you your extended mode for sure

407
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,620
would need the protocol modification the

408
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:45,439
simple mode you could do a pop of an

409
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:48,110
participe I guess yes just kind of echo

410
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,270
and as question so you you want to keep

411
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:55,100
going with both modes of a moment us who

412
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:57,650
intentions it but the two modes you've

413
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:01,240
got the simple and the extended you and

414
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:05,150
you're intending to keep developing both

415
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:07,010
I'm open and flexible so it depends

416
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:10,640
maybe be sure to have some discussion

417
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:14,900
and remaining this considering this no

418
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:19,100
that is just a proposal now in the first

419
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:23,120
draft version it's now basic to to have

420
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:27,110
a discussion I I guess and if there are

421
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:31,689
good reasons to remove the simple from

422
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:34,070
the draft why why not for sure the more

423
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:40,460
most sophisticated approach would be

424
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:44,480
extended which also promised the the

425
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:47,300
best effect and the highest impact on a

426
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,740
certain establishment so that's why I

427
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,860
personally prefer the

428
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,270
and robust establishment but just to

429
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:59,540
comprise any solution

430
00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:01,370
I added also the simple approach now you

431
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,320
Kristin so they say some are

432
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,360
implementing this one but can you

433
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,428
provide some kind of pasting environment

434
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:12,379
from your campaign yes or no as I

435
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:15,559
mentioned we we have some prototype

436
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,750
available an outdated one which we

437
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:20,389
developed to produce some meaningful

438
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:24,800
results in particular for the paper we

439
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,900
published and this one proved that

440
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:32,570
robust establishment is this is very

441
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:35,090
beneficial beneficial but pretty

442
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:37,159
convinced that we should not share this

443
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,889
outdated version because as I said it is

444
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:44,410
very buggy and I'm not sure if others

445
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:48,610
can really use it that why I propose to

446
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:54,650
develop it from scratch and directly

447
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:57,050
integrate the the functionalities of the

448
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:03,190
current current draft version what I

449
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:06,080
proposed at ITF 99 was far away from

450
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:10,220
from these two modes the simple and the

451
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,800
extended what our proposed No so that's

452
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:17,059
I that's why I would be very happy if

453
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:20,740
yes if someone is in the room who might

454
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:23,090
imagine to happen something like this

455
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,220
currently I don't see that we found out

456
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,689
to telecom have really the resources to

457
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,690
develop something from scratch again

458
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,609
oh yeah thank you

459
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:05,070
so next up is hwang whose remote and

460
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,429
hopefully i don't think you hit that one

461
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:10,928
yoshi because i think they make because

462
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:12,549
the meet echo people are supposed to do

463
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:15,399
things automatically no you're not

464
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:20,799
supposed to do it because i've got in

465
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:22,330
trouble dust unfitting that is that

466
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,549
right the meter had people should make

467
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,059
it happen to their magic should happen

468
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:34,418
them

469
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:36,960
wayne should be hang on I think we've

470
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,960
got you online

471
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,309
we can

472
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:57,979
hello hello oh yeah we can hear you ex

473
00:33:51,320 --> 00:34:02,570
okay okay thank you so hi everyone so my

474
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:09,820
name is Wong and we're in present to

475
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:09,819
propose options for NPT CP next slide

476
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:23,989
so the first one is the option to

477
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:36,530
specify and request in activity times

478
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:40,310
looks like so let's consider as simple

479
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:44,690
as simple case that the client create

480
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:47,270
the sub flow and it is peer with MPD's

481
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:52,099
capable and thence after sometimes it

482
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:56,418
just close the connection but this only

483
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:58,849
close the stuff flow so what the server

484
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:04,328
window how long it will keep their

485
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:04,329
entities recessions so next slide

486
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:19,430
so in ic 68 24 it does not specify how

487
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:24,640
long the impetus a horseshoe community

488
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:27,890
in the area options session so that we

489
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,868
consider the inactivity time that is the

490
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:37,299
duration that an empty three sessions

491
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:40,780
has no established a flow it's like so

492
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:44,930
should we recommend a deformed

493
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,680
inactivity timeout for TCP does not

494
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:52,250
recommend a different value for either

495
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,049
connection but it's specified the cable

496
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,670
life

497
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:59,839
Tomas like which is at least two hours

498
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:03,550
and not come out with two hour and four

499
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:08,869
minutes that place on the cable life

500
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:12,500
next slide so there are two years grades

501
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,930
to use the options the first is the host

502
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,190
one to keep the seasonal life through

503
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:21,500
the transient failure so to do that it

504
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:26,480
could request this fearful and enough

505
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:29,980
patio for this speed this strength does

506
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,390
not work because not somehow might just

507
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,690
terminate the connection but for mpg

508
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:38,118
speed not is not a problem the second

509
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:40,820
case is to when highly loaded servers

510
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,940
quickly terminate and use Bautista

511
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:46,609
sessions it by just setting locally a

512
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,800
small an idea and it might signal his

513
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:56,750
clients that other sessions will be

514
00:36:48,800 --> 00:37:03,050
closed shortly next slide so we start

515
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:04,369
with a simple format and main fuse is in

516
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,290
activity timeout

517
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:12,800
he said it's 16-bit and the range is

518
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:14,750
start from zero which means that the hot

519
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,700
screen will remove the session

520
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:20,500
immediately when there's no active saw

521
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:25,600
flow anymore and the maximum value

522
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:28,100
eternal is 18 hours

523
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,049
the option is indicatives

524
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:34,240
which means that local policy could have

525
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:37,310
right these options and is unreliable

526
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,799
but we can improve the delivery for

527
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:44,000
example by just saying it multiple times

528
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:47,180
per second or ITT or through the

529
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,870
lifetime another way is to attach it to

530
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:58,730
us TCP sequence number and let disappear

531
00:37:50,870 --> 00:38:02,089
transmission and do it next slide so the

532
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:09,770
next option is to really meet on a stop

533
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:11,690
flow it's like the motivation is for the

534
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:15,950
mobile user they usually have the

535
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:17,960
limited cellular data Kota but they want

536
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,600
to use the cellular network but they

537
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,080
need to limit the cost in terms of money

538
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:27,860
or reserve the doctor quota if that is

539
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:31,130
fixed but the kyon basically cannot

540
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:33,500
control the downstream data so the

541
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,750
solution is that client requests the

542
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:42,950
server a mustard sending rate on a stuff

543
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:46,580
flow next slide so as we think of a

544
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:50,569
similar option format but for the rate

545
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:56,680
it should be longer to be able to opt to

546
00:38:50,570 --> 00:39:01,190
express a longer range a bigger range so

547
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:04,910
so that we try to use the floating point

548
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:09,230
format of 62 bit so it means that

549
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:13,629
basically it could range from 0 to here

550
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:16,480
you can see the value is very big and

551
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:24,370
this option also indicative and

552
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:30,380
unreliable next slide so we have

553
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:34,460
prototype one one experiment that based

554
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:37,400
on daily news so we use a bps to quickly

555
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,950
test new and PT speed options

556
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,350
so basically on the client the BPI

557
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:46,040
program we insert the sub flow master

558
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:49,660
adoption and then on the server it will

559
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:56,300
read the mass rate and then based on the

560
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:58,640
smooth aditi to find the clamp window to

561
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:02,600
limit the amount of data to be sent in

562
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,540
that we are in that at that moment and

563
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:10,900
it could be done periodically for for

564
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:15,020
example a TT to update the window clamp

565
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,490
for example if the srt t changed over

566
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:22,509
time

567
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:26,509
next slide so as you can see we have

568
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:29,390
measured the transfer rate on the second

569
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:33,650
part second step flow into case the

570
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:37,210
deformed with no capping and the red one

571
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:42,260
with the red capping options with disk

572
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:46,610
window clamping mechanism at four

573
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:52,370
megabit and it worked pretty well next

574
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:55,130
slide so what about requesting a rate

575
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:58,370
limited zero because it could allow the

576
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:01,910
pr2 this several several temporarily for

577
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:05,420
example if we the client have to

578
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:11,270
connection Wi-Fi and cellular but then

579
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:14,810
he move between the route Wi-Fi and bad

580
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:20,720
Wi-Fi or to go out home so it can

581
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:26,410
smoothly disable the cellular path based

582
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,410
on the Wi-Fi condition next slide

583
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,410
so there are others open questions like

584
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:38,299
how to improve the reality so it's

585
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:42,980
similar to the timer option that we can

586
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,860
send several times or we can let the

587
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,910
server to respond to the request maybe

588
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:51,779
with a flat bit

589
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:54,480
then what about the duration of bread

590
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:56,789
limit policy should we let it until the

591
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,660
end of the connections or allow the

592
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:03,750
client to specify because yeah if we we

593
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:07,950
allowed that it will occupy more TCP

594
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:12,089
option space or we can compile it other

595
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:16,230
use case like we said on it's a flow to

596
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:19,319
be in backup most as long as the network

597
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:22,529
quality is that is fries we can have

598
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:26,038
specified the traffic ratio the most up

599
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:29,549
flows or we can cut the amount data is

600
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:31,980
that of the read but he personally I

601
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:35,160
think that there are different use case

602
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:41,849
and maybe that is too complex if we mix

603
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:44,569
them together okay so that's all for my

604
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:44,569
presentations

605
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:58,820
thanks hey so we've had we've had two

606
00:42:53,250 --> 00:43:02,430
proposals yeah so so we are there any

607
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:06,330
comments or questions about it'd be good

608
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:15,350
to talk about one and then the other I

609
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:15,350
guess so your she's just coming to the

610
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:23,970
know this is your secret program about

611
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,700
the rate control option so in this

612
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:30,899
proposal the center side capped the

613
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,569
window size yes how it is actuate or not

614
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,690
activate all right you know if we the

615
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:40,110
client-side controlled advertisement

616
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,860
window size to some extent we can do the

617
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:46,470
semester and then but why you are trying

618
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:54,000
to control at the server side not cryin

619
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:57,540
side because it's not very accurate you

620
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,720
means that you why we want to control on

621
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,730
the server side right because no client

622
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,490
side if you can control the

623
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:08,120
advertisement window size to some extent

624
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:12,149
you can control the sub-array

625
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:15,060
but for the entity speed the pulse

626
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:20,220
applause share the same windows the risk

627
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:25,320
if windows yeah but you can tweak that

628
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:30,450
path here but that have different

629
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:35,270
semantics so they for the product can be

630
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:38,850
I don't know that if you three drops it

631
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:44,060
then that will be just trigger fastly

632
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:44,060
transmission but okay

633
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:56,290
because you think you might change the

634
00:44:48,160 --> 00:45:03,598
semantics of the NPT speak Ryan okay

635
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:03,599
maybe we can okay

636
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,589
one more question sorry this is just a

637
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,440
little curiosity about inactivity my

638
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:19,570
option I'm wondering what was the

639
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,589
default okay current the behavior like a

640
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:26,080
phoenix infinity you know they eat the

641
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:28,089
leaders in the news I'm not so sure but

642
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,700
I from my experiment and my

643
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:35,770
understanding of the code then it just

644
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:38,770
keep the connection forever except maybe

645
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:43,359
that under the memory pressure they even

646
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:45,960
kick it that yeah I think it just keeps

647
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,960
forever

648
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:02,010
comments and questions alive of these an

649
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,629
especially on the second one we did that

650
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,440
ship fair bit of discussion on the

651
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:11,359
mainland yes

652
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:11,359
maybe that all got resolved thank you

653
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:18,000
okay

654
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:23,599
nobody seems to be asking any more

655
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,599
questions so thank thanks hey thanks

656
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:44,339
I think it sorts of cell phone so next

657
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,940
up is Marcelo to talk about this

658
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,940
purposely related work

659
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:25,060
okay hi so in this document we stuff and

660
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,919
Amelia what we have tried to do is to

661
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,549
make an analysis of the potential

662
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:33,730
privacy threats that multiple TCP

663
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:36,040
protocol has and so the scope here is

664
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:39,520
very similar to what we have done

665
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:43,660
regarding security that is basically try

666
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:46,180
to understand compared to regular TCP

667
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:49,629
whether the use of the multiple TCP

668
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:53,529
protocol introduces additional privacy

669
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:57,640
threats right it's out of the scope of

670
00:47:53,530 --> 00:48:01,000
the document to try to perform a general

671
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,609
analysis of privacy threats that affect

672
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,500
the same electricity and multi-party

673
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,780
city right the goal here is to

674
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,530
understand if because we're using

675
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,240
multiple TCP we're exposing additional

676
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:15,670
information that would not be visible if

677
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:19,299
we only use this it okay so basically

678
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:22,119
the goal here is to eventually restore

679
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:24,400
the same level of privacy that you have

680
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:30,280
when you use TCP when you start using

681
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:32,980
multipath visit okay so I mean you can

682
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,140
easily see that that multiple TCP may

683
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,840
have some potential privacy threats

684
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,900
right essentially what you're doing is

685
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,970
you're exposing multiple IP addresses

686
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,190
but whoever is able to observe that

687
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:47,618
particular signaling will be able to

688
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:50,380
bind together right so essentially the

689
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:53,830
you can conceive to potential privacy

690
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:56,859
threats here one is regarding movement

691
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:59,740
tracking right so because I Mabel to

692
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:01,750
observe the same device is changing IPS

693
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:05,560
I can actually track where this device

694
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:08,020
is going right and eventually if one

695
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:12,910
part in the device is exposing multiple

696
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:14,710
of IPRs at the same time maybe I can

697
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,379
actually have a more accurate position

698
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,789
of that particular device because I

699
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,999
don't know maybe the Wi-Fi

700
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:24,939
has a shorter range shorter scope some

701
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:27,098
more precise location than a cellular I

702
00:49:24,939 --> 00:49:30,999
mean an IP really is associated to a

703
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:34,779
cellular provide then the analysis that

704
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:36,578
we do is we do based on the type of

705
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:38,019
attackers I mean you have different

706
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:40,689
types of attackers attackers that are

707
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:43,359
partially on path or attackers that are

708
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:48,399
in all the possible paths the PCP will

709
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:50,729
will will use so if we go into the

710
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,150
detail mechanics of the of the attacks

711
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:56,739
there are two types of attacks one when

712
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,349
you use and pick a problem between

713
00:49:56,739 --> 00:50:03,069
another one will use analysis these are

714
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:05,739
the two the the protocol messages that

715
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:07,989
are susceptible of this type of attacks

716
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:10,660
all right so if you're using MP cable NP

717
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:12,729
join basically if you observe the token

718
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,649
that has been a change in the MP cable

719
00:50:12,729 --> 00:50:16,569
and you observe the same talk in

720
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,789
different MP joint messages you can

721
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:21,999
actually track down that it's the same

722
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:23,890
device that has and bind all these

723
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:26,319
houses together all right

724
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:28,328
in the case of the other address you can

725
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,029
actually bind that addresses containing

726
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:33,489
the other s message to the - between

727
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:36,339
them if you have multiple of them and to

728
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:38,739
the others that is being used for that

729
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:43,719
particular flow where there are others

730
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:45,279
messages being exchanged okay these

731
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:49,329
things are actually not very hard to fix

732
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:52,029
right I mean if you want to solve the

733
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:53,169
other there is vulnerability the only

734
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:55,449
thing that you need to do is to encrypt

735
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:59,259
their addresses containing the multi

736
00:50:55,449 --> 00:51:01,619
party CP message with multiple TCP

737
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:03,999
connection key right with that

738
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:05,979
essentially anyone who can observe the

739
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:11,618
first message can actually decrypt this

740
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:14,919
but you're essentially imposing that the

741
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:17,169
vulnerability is only if the attacker is

742
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:19,629
on the initial path right which is

743
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:22,029
basically the spirit of the whole

744
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:24,609
multi-party CP security so probably that

745
00:51:22,029 --> 00:51:26,559
will restore to a similar level to all

746
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:29,799
the rest of security features of multi

747
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,019
participant if you want to prevent the

748
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:32,710
multi path keep the NP cable and is

749
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:34,660
joined by

750
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:38,470
that well essentially what you need to

751
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:40,779
do is to actually change the token for

752
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,430
every MP joint right and you can

753
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,740
actually change it in a predictable way

754
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:47,558
right so if you do write on a hash of

755
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:51,040
the address and and the key for instance

756
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:53,230
that will actually allow you to to not

757
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,558
expose always the same token and hence

758
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:57,970
restore the privacy features as I said I

759
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:02,410
mean this these are fairly

760
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:04,689
straightforward countermeasures I don't

761
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:07,808
think they are very hard some period if

762
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,710
it's worthwhile doing them but just for

763
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:11,380
the sake of the nonce

764
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,030
and then probably there are a few other

765
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,730
things that we can actually include in

766
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:18,369
the in the document for instance some

767
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:20,740
guidelines in order to make people aware

768
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:23,079
that when you're exposing more addresses

769
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,430
you are exposing information so prior

770
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:26,020
some guidelines when you should be doing

771
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:28,180
that I mean if you have ten addresses

772
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:30,550
it's not worthwhile exposing all of them

773
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,319
at the same time and only use the expose

774
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,849
the one that you are planning to use or

775
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,890
stuff like that some guidelines like

776
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:38,790
that that will create some form of

777
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:41,700
awareness regarding these these issues

778
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:45,460
and that's pretty much it

779
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,500
so I guess the question is whether the

780
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,369
working group is interested in doing

781
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:57,839
something in this pace or or not and I

782
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:57,839
guess comments and questions

783
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:15,009
you know Yoshi from flora yeah I think I

784
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:19,569
understand the motivation and then so

785
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:21,990
one question I have is please say the

786
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:26,170
attacker monitors March for point and

787
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:30,609
then sorry sorry ok they attack our

788
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:35,620
monitors traffic's at multiple point and

789
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:40,090
then instead of a data well MP join they

790
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:44,680
check monitor the DSS option data sync

791
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:47,080
as number and then if they observed this

792
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,750
beta seekest number and they no

793
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,730
different no connection has just almost

794
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:55,300
a similar data's incorrect number and

795
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:57,190
then the attacker might be invite this

796
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,150
connection dyskinesia belong to the same

797
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,150
in PPC pieces

798
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:06,310
that's a good that's that's a good

799
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,640
addition I will await it I haven't

800
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:11,920
thought about it yes I agree yeah that

801
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,600
means you have to we have to think about

802
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,380
security of the DSS office as well

803
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:24,339
correct to security or at least the DSS

804
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:27,790
option right yeah no we rather than you

805
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:31,540
know we are you know enhance in PT

806
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:34,680
spokes on one by one or we might want to

807
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:38,290
you know think about the framework that

808
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:41,589
encrypt entire every single MPEG option

809
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:45,279
might be a yeah why can't you just

810
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:50,950
include the DSS option with the with the

811
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:53,110
with the session key yeah I mean III I

812
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,700
mean I understand or one option that

813
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:57,970
you're saying is okay let's provide a

814
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,290
framework that provides overall security

815
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:01,899
or confidentiality of the whole thing

816
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:05,020
the other thing would be and maybe

817
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:08,350
regional is you protect everything with

818
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:10,150
the session key and you enable different

819
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,560
ways of creating decision the session

820
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:14,140
key at this point basically what you

821
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,330
have is you you exchange it in clear but

822
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:18,040
if you manage to negotiate that key from

823
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:19,810
which some other means then it

824
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,750
automatically protects the whole nor the

825
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:23,720
rest of the things

826
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:25,820
that could work as well I guess I don't

827
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:29,230
know which is better that's what Michael

828
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:36,050
yeah you are more security guy Tommy I

829
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:39,590
mean the thing is we have talked many

830
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:41,990
times in the past about doing a secure

831
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:44,359
version of multi participate right

832
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:46,220
either combining with TLS you will

833
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:52,490
combine it with this pin it will combine

834
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:54,589
it with something right and that so

835
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:59,270
that's something that we can take we can

836
00:55:54,590 --> 00:56:02,030
take on probably if we want to do that

837
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:05,000
it would make sense to actually provide

838
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:07,580
like a thread analysis for the whole

839
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,130
protocol and try to define what are the

840
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,020
security goals for for the multi party

841
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,580
city secure version that that's

842
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,200
something that probably worthwhile I

843
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:18,410
mean I mean if you want to go that path

844
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,640
that's something that we should - what I

845
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:22,910
was trying to do in this particular

846
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,950
document is to actually because the

847
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:27,589
thing is if you go in that path it's a

848
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:30,348
major change in the product it's not a

849
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:32,599
minor update this is like a significant

850
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:34,609
change in the product what I was trying

851
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:38,980
to provide here that I think it is

852
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:41,779
feasible is doing minor tweaks in

853
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,490
potential for the future version or or

854
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:46,250
even in a document like this just simply

855
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:48,410
updating the base spec because it's

856
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,940
really a minor update I mean the stuff

857
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:53,390
that that I'm proposing here I really

858
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:55,880
really mind right so if I think you I

859
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:57,200
mean we need to take to understand

860
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,750
whether it's possible if you can solve

861
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,669
in particular the the additional attack

862
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,230
that you are presenting here or not but

863
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,960
as I said these are really minor things

864
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:07,550
right so you could actually do this and

865
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,570
restore somehow the privacy of the

866
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:13,640
product and you could do go all the way

867
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:18,410
and actually provide like a full-blown

868
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:21,170
encrypt SiC more secure version yeah I

869
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,359
think that the times the timescales for

870
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:24,410
these two things are very different

871
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:27,259
right and then the effort that requires

872
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:28,970
is very even so I don't know if both of

873
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:32,050
them make sense any of them make sense

874
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:32,049
none of them make sense

875
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,580
yeah just

876
00:57:41,170 --> 00:58:05,710
any more comments or questions so that's

877
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:08,349
the end of the individual graphs before

878
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:10,420
we move on for the rest

879
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:12,670
somebody wanted to come up to the mic

880
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:17,109
and tell us about some work they're

881
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:20,920
doing with hip and multiple TCP and tell

882
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:23,799
us about side meeting yes Adam Whittaker

883
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:26,920
um AX enterprise so we've been using

884
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:31,119
multipath TCP for a little bit now in

885
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:33,160
the u.s. area so UAS is part of the

886
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,500
thing that they're pushing is multiple

887
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,500
radios on a UAS

888
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:41,130
for failover and it's just seems like an

889
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:43,869
obvious thing to put multipath TCP on

890
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:47,769
the radio because they want to move all

891
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:49,119
their communications over to IP and part

892
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:52,839
of the work that we're doing has been

893
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:57,369
trying to put hip underneath multipath

894
00:58:52,839 --> 00:59:03,369
TCP net has led to some problems mainly

895
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:05,769
that a hip hides the IP locators which

896
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:08,319
is what's used for the sub flows in TCP

897
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:10,959
and it's a problem that we've been

898
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,369
thinking of but we haven't been doing

899
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,799
anything with and we don't have the

900
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:18,789
expertise so I'm opening it up to

901
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:20,650
everyone here that is an MP TCP to

902
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:22,690
hopefully garner some discussion because

903
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:25,630
we feel like maybe it's something has to

904
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:29,049
happen at the MP TCP side or hip side or

905
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:29,799
both we're not sure where it merges

906
00:59:29,049 --> 00:59:34,480
together

907
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:38,559
um so tonight at 610 in room C two on

908
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:41,519
floor 21 we're having a hip side meeting

909
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:44,140
it's mostly based on trustworthy

910
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,359
multi-purpose remote ID which is our

911
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:49,598
current focus but because we've been

912
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:51,759
using MP TCP in the UAS spectrum we'd be

913
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:55,089
more than happy to chat get comments

914
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:57,819
suggestions etc so feel free to stop by

915
00:59:55,089 --> 01:00:03,788
and say hello so that that's tonight at

916
00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:07,808
10 p.m. tonight at us 610 Oak 610 610

917
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:09,969
yes 6 1 0 yeah good could you send a

918
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:14,049
limo yes I can definitely send an email

919
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:18,519
and the problem I'm having with hip and

920
01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:21,460
multipass DCP I'll be opening a post on

921
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:31,529
the mailing list later tonight to start

922
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:31,529
discussion there as well thanks

923
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:06,259
so we're now moving on to the topic form

924
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:11,839
the agenda at the future the working

925
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:14,299
group I've got brief summary to talk

926
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:17,720
through Mason there's lots of time for

927
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:21,319
an open discussion about us and just to

928
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:24,709
note that in the TSB area meeting on

929
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:28,130
Thursday afternoon is a little time

930
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:30,259
stopped there to talk about um where

931
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:33,619
multi-path work should be done in the

932
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:38,150
ITF and future so really this discussion

933
01:01:33,619 --> 01:01:39,859
today impinges on that bit and that that

934
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:41,630
topic on thirst is slightly broader

935
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:45,558
because it includes things like melting

936
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:49,430
pot quick as well so that's some one for

937
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:51,440
information to go along to the TSB area

938
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:57,200
meeting if you did you want to

939
01:01:51,440 --> 01:02:00,259
contribute to that discussion right so

940
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,578
the future the working group I guess the

941
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:04,490
default we've talked about this a bit

942
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:08,150
before about you know having largely

943
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:11,029
what we have now completed what we got

944
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:14,059
reach arted to do so which the main item

945
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:18,049
was to develop the best version of the

946
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:20,329
protocol and that's now in the kind of

947
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:22,880
final editing with Ayane and the RFC

948
01:02:20,329 --> 01:02:25,519
editor which is great but unders mean

949
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,859
we've we've basically completed what we

950
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:30,200
set out to do in in the recharter so we

951
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:34,339
need to think about what so what to do

952
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:38,149
next the defaults having completed the

953
01:02:34,339 --> 01:02:41,930
charters that the working group ends and

954
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:46,670
closes you know sign up in in triumph

955
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:49,368
and declare success you know there would

956
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:51,650
be some minor extensions maintenance

957
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:55,670
work that that might might still need to

958
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:59,029
be done and eCPM will be an obvious

959
01:02:55,670 --> 01:03:01,309
place to do that so having said that

960
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:03,259
that's kind of the default of what would

961
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:08,670
happen which will be happening about a

962
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:10,589
meeting cycle time the working group

963
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:13,260
you know and discuss this with our with

964
01:03:10,589 --> 01:03:16,349
our 80 near the working group can

965
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,109
continue there's not a problem of doing

966
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:22,230
that but until you need to be active

967
01:03:18,109 --> 01:03:24,750
items to to progress in the working

968
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:28,220
group and that really means that there

969
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:31,079
needs to be multiple people involved to

970
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:36,359
do the design the documentation and

971
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:39,750
reviewing and see and somebody's going

972
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:42,000
to implement the ID live as well and I

973
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:44,640
guess we need more than one kind of

974
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:49,530
small topic that applies to those active

975
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:53,640
items so you know get here today and

976
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:56,099
then over the next few weeks min before

977
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:59,009
the next night yet we need to kind of

978
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:02,220
find out if if that is true and there

979
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:04,410
are a number of active items with with

980
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:08,598
the number of people who who want to do

981
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:13,319
work on them or if it's you know that

982
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:15,710
there's not some people of it's not that

983
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:21,390
interest at the moment

984
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:25,140
to do to do active work so as a as a

985
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:29,430
kind of point of information in the next

986
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:31,950
slide of we've listed the if you go on

987
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:34,980
the beta track of the active individual

988
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:36,839
drafts that there are so these the ones

989
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:39,510
that the data track that considers a

990
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:41,880
kind of live documents I mean the worst

991
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:45,930
set will expire draft that I think

992
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:48,650
people may want to reactivate you know

993
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:51,270
we just heard about the one of combining

994
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:53,970
for best security combining them with

995
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:57,180
TLS and that's no longer neck to drop it

996
01:04:53,970 --> 01:05:01,558
was there an impasse there may be other

997
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:04,230
ones as well so this that this is a list

998
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:06,920
of active individual graph so this it

999
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:10,950
kind of maybe things that people want to

1000
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:13,200
to take on and there's a sufficient

1001
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:16,589
group of people who are prepared to work

1002
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:20,058
on them and development we can we can

1003
01:05:16,589 --> 01:05:20,058
keep going as a working group

1004
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:28,790
you know whether one or two obese go to

1005
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:30,710
eCPM or on a suitable home so this the

1006
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:35,000
robust session establishment stuff that

1007
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:39,350
we heard out about today from for Marcus

1008
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:44,720
and he made requests for some beater to

1009
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:45,200
implement that there's an active there's

1010
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,299
a draft

1011
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,560
called initial path selection which to

1012
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:53,720
me kind of sounds a similar problem

1013
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:56,960
because trauma tackles so that might be

1014
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:01,100
a way of trying to get some extra people

1015
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:03,410
working on the same idea there was the

1016
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:05,529
privacy threats that Marcelo just talked

1017
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,529
about

1018
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:11,240
I've tried bearing in brackets by by the

1019
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:14,690
way to list the main author and then I

1020
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:19,759
put some affiliation so after you know

1021
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:21,710
Marcelo's at u3 uc3m but then I'd put

1022
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,780
affiliations in practice after to

1023
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:26,150
indicate there is actually already in on

1024
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:28,240
that one a group of people from

1025
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:30,590
different institutions who are all

1026
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:37,240
sufficiently interested in this work to

1027
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:42,350
have been a co-author on it thus the

1028
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:47,390
work that Sebastian did looking at how

1029
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:51,250
to get TFO and not of TCP to play well

1030
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:57,020
with each other and posting some mobster

1031
01:06:51,250 --> 01:07:01,460
MPG see people where there's a he is

1032
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:04,880
five PI D session continuity work it's

1033
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:07,850
the sweet EVP session continuity stuff

1034
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,850
we look identified some inefficiencies

1035
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:16,759
of getting that to not a novice beater

1036
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:19,819
to as the solution from the session

1037
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:23,750
continuity and up with some ideas for

1038
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:26,240
overcoming those inefficiencies thus the

1039
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:28,970
two drafts that hangers talked about

1040
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:34,089
early today the inactivity time option

1041
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:34,089
and sub flow rate limit

1042
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:42,740
then listen look see other work which we

1043
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:47,420
haven't heard about today the extended

1044
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:53,149
socket api's proposal to extend that API

1045
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:58,220
to indicate priority of sub flows there

1046
01:07:53,150 --> 01:08:00,519
was a proposal from a song to measure

1047
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:03,950
one-way latency to kind of help with the

1048
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:06,439
scheduler a multi-speed scheduler and

1049
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:10,640
then lastly there was another

1050
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:14,839
shephelah related one that's fantastic

1051
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:17,448
optimal scheduler which is a draft on

1052
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:19,519
there I'm not sure we've ever had she

1053
01:08:17,448 --> 01:08:24,259
had that presented and a meeting though

1054
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,270
that's another life dropped and so that

1055
01:08:24,259 --> 01:08:28,370
was kind of for information as the list

1056
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,779
of individual graphs we actually have

1057
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:34,238
quite a lot of quite a number of

1058
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:37,580
individual graphs but you know

1059
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:40,309
characterize feed overall problem is

1060
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:46,639
that these tend to be ones that is kind

1061
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:49,580
of a small group who are interested in

1062
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:52,040
it and it doesn't get that much it's

1063
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:55,370
been hard to grow those from Lee from

1064
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:57,439
the proposer a big interview draft and

1065
01:08:55,370 --> 01:09:01,250
that's not true for absolutely to all

1066
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:03,649
the people that in genuine country it's

1067
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:06,889
a kind of now it's it's kind of open for

1068
01:09:03,649 --> 01:09:10,129
discussion already about how people see

1069
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:12,259
futures working group if people are

1070
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:14,900
happy if we close if people want to try

1071
01:09:12,259 --> 01:09:19,279
and pick some of these or some different

1072
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:21,399
ones to really get some some live work

1073
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:24,440
with with several different people

1074
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:26,778
contributing to the review side the

1075
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:29,899
development of the protocol the idea and

1076
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:35,469
for implementation of that is relevant

1077
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:38,388
to the idea so the mic is open and

1078
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:42,939
lucentio and Omnitech as well be one

1079
01:09:38,389 --> 01:09:46,359
talks and we'll go to to Montreal first

1080
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:48,578
Marcus again Marcus Allen

1081
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:51,190
so I have several questions maybe some

1082
01:09:48,578 --> 01:09:54,340
of them are related to Miriah comfort

1083
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:59,440
area director so can you go to the

1084
01:09:54,340 --> 01:10:01,300
previous slide please first okay so in

1085
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:04,839
the first point you raise that maybe my

1086
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:07,300
next tensions maintains us made it is

1087
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,280
p.m. my question is what are minor

1088
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,110
extensions for example today I proposed

1089
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:16,960
the robust establishment it was a minor

1090
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:19,480
extension or a major extension it is

1091
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:24,400
maybe that much relevant that it makes

1092
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:25,718
sense to keep so what what are my next

1093
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:31,949
sentence what not the first question

1094
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:35,949
second question is in federal we at idea

1095
01:10:31,949 --> 01:10:38,969
multi-part related developments in

1096
01:10:35,949 --> 01:10:42,400
multiple TCP as such its multipath quick

1097
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:46,500
we also proposed market cost DCP for

1098
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:51,250
example so in general it makes sense to

1099
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:56,260
or shall we collect them may be in one

1100
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:59,079
working in second point and the third

1101
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:02,530
point is and that is one also one of the

1102
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:05,860
active draft documents we have in the in

1103
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:07,659
the last slide that multiple TCP the

1104
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:12,269
protocols elected by three TPP for

1105
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:15,250
market multiple activity purposes so

1106
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:17,949
that's why I wanna ask it as part of the

1107
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:20,020
liaison between you could appear an ITF

1108
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:23,400
and for that reason does it make sense

1109
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:23,400
to keep multiplicity

1110
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:34,290
give me a clue living small ad question

1111
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:35,880
I'm along my net extension that's for

1112
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,860
the GPM group to decide on a

1113
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,320
case-by-case basis but in general if you

1114
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:42,000
have if you want to add one amputees P

1115
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:45,870
sub option I would think that's a minor

1116
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,250
extension so basically everything that's

1117
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:49,800
on there under this right now are

1118
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:51,300
probably my extension the only reason to

1119
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,890
keep the working group is if there's

1120
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,810
like a long list of mine extensions you

1121
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:57,120
all want to do and then maybe you know

1122
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,430
I'm working with make sense and question

1123
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,849
number two yes that's exactly my problem

1124
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:04,140
we have all these magic press work which

1125
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,770
is discussed in different problems and

1126
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:10,950
we want to make sure that we we have

1127
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:12,300
people exchanging their ideas and not

1128
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:14,760
like working on two things in parallel

1129
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,530
and whatever coming to different

1130
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,540
conclusions for whatever reason so

1131
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:20,490
that's the main problem here but that's

1132
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:25,050
a discussion I want to have in Gees the

1133
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:27,900
area fantastic and Third Point yes the

1134
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:30,420
3gpp liaison is very aware of this usage

1135
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:32,700
of empathy TCP but they use it as

1136
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:35,370
specified I don't see there any any

1137
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,950
requests to actually change the protocol

1138
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:40,790
and they can use it as specified so I

1139
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:40,790
think we're good on that

1140
01:12:49,249 --> 01:12:52,849
um

1141
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:55,050
Florina you are you following up on

1142
01:12:52,849 --> 01:12:58,230
those comments is just because other

1143
01:12:55,050 --> 01:13:02,869
circum and a strictly related on 3gpp if

1144
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:05,518
you practically have two drafts better

1145
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:07,920
dependencies one of them percolate since

1146
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:09,539
the last code the other one which would

1147
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,300
I assume that you're gonna conclude it

1148
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:14,880
so from this perspective is artistic

1149
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:17,489
extensions for multiple operation

1150
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,380
multiple addresses so once met on it is

1151
01:13:17,489 --> 01:13:21,959
concluded you practically have zero

1152
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,710
dependencies from this work so there is

1153
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,749
another reason

1154
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:26,699
Florine Curtis might show I heard what

1155
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:28,949
you said so you the 3gpp has a

1156
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:31,320
dependency yes I kind of live there are

1157
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:34,018
two drafts okay

1158
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:37,170
one of them is a zero RTP PCP convert

1159
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:39,559
protocol it is the last call okay from

1160
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:42,869
what I understood the other one is the

1161
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:45,210
main draft that you have 26 tensions for

1162
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:47,219
multi path operation with multiple

1163
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:55,579
addresses which will gonna conclude it I

1164
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:57,719
assume by xiah TF 406 yeah so the way we

1165
01:13:55,579 --> 01:14:00,719
GP is that we keep a list of

1166
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:03,630
dependencies so we know which documents

1167
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,760
which RFC drafts are referenced in three

1168
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:08,400
documents and there are two references

1169
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,230
which are relevant to the NPT CP work

1170
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,629
one is to the best document which is now

1171
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:14,339
approved therefore we're good here and

1172
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:17,760
the other one is to the TCP converter

1173
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:24,150
which is working TC p.m. and this is

1174
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:46,650
approaching as thank you so we should

1175
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:49,339
have the person in it doesn't have to be

1176
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,339
in this working

1177
01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:05,889
we have anything all we have we actually

1178
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:08,380
may be spectacular annoyed you know you

1179
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:16,360
would be to use my I'll type it into the

1180
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:19,420
chair and anything because I yeah I can

1181
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:31,989
you knew John with you again because

1182
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:33,730
there's a lot of noise and so what you

1183
01:15:31,989 --> 01:15:35,589
said if you want to send up the wound of

1184
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:39,638
their support for working on an

1185
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:43,860
encrypted version of mpg city he's

1186
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:43,860
saying please need believe the field

1187
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,259
[Music]

1188
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:59,900
the who has been turned off so it was it

1189
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,599
was this the people support having all

1190
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:04,429
the options encrypted to get a more

1191
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:10,969
secure version lot of these three maps

1192
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:12,260
across America do people want to comment

1193
01:16:10,969 --> 01:16:15,559
on that that's probably easier than

1194
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:17,659
having a hum isn't it people like that

1195
01:16:15,559 --> 01:16:21,440
idea of working on a more secure version

1196
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:22,940
where you tripped all the options I'll

1197
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,259
tell you what let's have a show of hands

1198
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:26,570
who would who would actually want to

1199
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:30,679
work on do some work on an encrypted

1200
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:35,230
version a lot of TCP she contribute to

1201
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:35,230
the document and then MS analysis for it

1202
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:45,759
so I see Marcelo Marcel is gonna be busy

1203
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:57,829
individual comment and and I I love TCP

1204
01:16:55,579 --> 01:17:02,420
right I don't want to be mean to TCP but

1205
01:16:57,829 --> 01:17:06,070
if you want encryption use quick they

1206
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:06,070
might be working on a magic abortion

1207
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:19,469
the reason why people not very

1208
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:30,510
interested is it will be very

1209
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:34,260
complicated risk asking a different

1210
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:36,420
question who would be against work like

1211
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:38,270
that thing done you think that was a bad

1212
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:42,989
idea

1213
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:50,070
does anybody think it'd be bad one okay

1214
01:17:42,989 --> 01:17:52,409
so there's one couple you want to make

1215
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:54,739
it if you want to say why or we don't

1216
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:54,739
have to

1217
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:06,440
as Nicholas Blair I just think it'd be

1218
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:08,150
too heavy way to include that much

1219
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,639
encryption into the different header

1220
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:22,370
fields and we would essentially just be

1221
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:26,090
redoing work that's being done anyway so

1222
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:28,010
TCP Inc has studied someone application

1223
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:33,280
for TCP ink wasn't busy

1224
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:37,000
Felicity right now 50 TCP ink does not

1225
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:42,139
encrypt the header so we cannot use it

1226
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:47,410
but if we modify the CPE then this

1227
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:59,000
option might be possible and opinion for

1228
01:18:47,410 --> 01:19:00,590
HP ink export want to say something Mia

1229
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,250
cool even again so there's like

1230
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:05,420
basically zero deployment of disappea I

1231
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:09,220
wouldn't want to continue any work

1232
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:09,220
before we get any experience out of it

1233
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:28,059
any more comments or questions i dra

1234
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,059
meet echo or

1235
01:19:32,379 --> 01:19:41,840
om jabber this one is a right one yeah

1236
01:19:36,559 --> 01:19:44,719
Allah mentions so he has proposed Tiaras

1237
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:49,669
for us MPD's integration some time ago

1238
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:55,099
and it's already has been submitted as

1239
01:19:49,669 --> 01:20:00,079
an individual draft and that's one

1240
01:19:55,099 --> 01:20:03,499
pointer and then I can around do you

1241
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:07,898
want to enhance for working on this one

1242
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:07,898
nagging revive this one

1243
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,978
just one last question Marcus again does

1244
01:20:49,269 --> 01:20:56,729
it mean we will have another meeting at

1245
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:56,729
idea 106 or it does the last one today

1246
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:06,519
look we haven't made a decision about

1247
01:21:02,559 --> 01:21:09,309
that because the discussion here is not

1248
01:21:06,519 --> 01:21:15,550
the end of it so this is a this is the

1249
01:21:09,309 --> 01:21:17,320
prompt people need to find topics on

1250
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:22,329
which people want to collaborate and do

1251
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:26,018
work it's lots of topics then we will

1252
01:21:22,329 --> 01:21:26,440
meet in 106 Hawkins yeah if there are

1253
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:29,679
none

1254
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:34,749
I guess we won't order big short meeting

1255
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:41,050
I don't know he caught the side of this

1256
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:43,690
distance rate comment from Chuck and saw

1257
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:46,510
a dimension here is that trust MPT speed

1258
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:50,110
digression the raft has been submitted

1259
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:53,800
long time ago and then he said if people

1260
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:58,089
are interested in it I would contribute

1261
01:21:53,800 --> 01:22:02,679
I mean that means probably he can divide

1262
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:06,429
the drug in the back unit and this is

1263
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:11,559
relatively easy rather than building

1264
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:14,710
something from scratch to integrate and

1265
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:19,150
to add more security feature in any TCP

1266
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:24,479
spec and so there might be interesting

1267
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:24,478
pass or secure button of MPCP

1268
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:36,369
Ohio

1269
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:38,049
I just wanted to flag up that obviously

1270
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:40,509
a lot of people don't want to do

1271
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:41,679
encryption at the TCP level and that's

1272
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:44,280
kind of sensible we've got teased the

1273
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:46,960
ink already you don't want to go into

1274
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,509
reinventing the wheel here but we have T

1275
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,749
a TLS and the proposal we put in that

1276
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:55,989
draft I posted a link for was simply to

1277
01:22:52,749 --> 01:22:58,929
do TLS key extraction and use the keys

1278
01:22:55,989 --> 01:23:03,518
to engage the

1279
01:22:58,929 --> 01:23:07,059
TLS the engage use the keys and TLS to

1280
01:23:03,519 --> 01:23:08,800
do the session security if it's only

1281
01:23:07,059 --> 01:23:10,269
like a four-page graph because that's

1282
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:14,079
all you need to do this and there was

1283
01:23:10,269 --> 01:23:15,639
next grand prix tcp operon farming i

1284
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:19,570
haven't thought about how much would be

1285
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:21,760
one this was still a v0 thing but if

1286
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:24,219
there is an increased interest in doing

1287
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:32,499
encryption i would like to propose that

1288
01:23:24,219 --> 01:23:35,800
as a starting point for vehicle even so

1289
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:38,169
if there is any interest in this

1290
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:42,179
proposal i would strongly recommend to

1291
01:23:38,169 --> 01:23:42,179
bring it also to the TLS working

1292
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:54,420
so you know I mean this has nothing to

1293
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:56,370
do with pls and Els is used as this you

1294
01:23:54,420 --> 01:24:07,380
just exact the key and use the key to

1295
01:23:56,370 --> 01:24:09,030
fit it through to so right there is some

1296
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,470
purpose no interface to extract the key

1297
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:11,730
so if you propose them to have such an

1298
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:14,000
interface they will not be happy about

1299
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:14,000
it

1300
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:30,240
the people in the room is the or on - or

1301
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:35,410
anybody whose will be interested in

1302
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:36,510
helping Alan revive this work and

1303
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:41,830
working on it

1304
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:44,190
anybody interested in is at least Yoshi

1305
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:44,190
Yoshi

1306
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:05,080
I think blue bank guys have been

1307
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:05,080
interested in the past

1308
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:16,730
Olivier's the quarter of the is the

1309
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:20,230
author of the tax problem was

1310
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:20,230
interesting the person she wrote it

1311
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:35,250
okay any anymore comments or questions

1312
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:43,390
hey echoing fella from Germany I have a

1313
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,580
question

1314
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:48,910
could it be that a lot of people are in

1315
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:52,080
holiday and so because you have a lot of

1316
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:56,320
individual drafts what we have seen and

1317
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:59,800
I here see you

1318
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:01,780
not so much discussion today but in

1319
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:05,530
Prague we see a lot of discussion more

1320
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:10,570
discussions I remember so maybe it is

1321
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:14,650
only a bad day yeah

1322
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:18,070
so when I proposed not too close there

1323
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:29,740
is the working group and to wait until

1324
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:30,610
the next meeting IDF 106 maybe yeah me

1325
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:33,490
if you want to comment

1326
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:35,559
yeah shred in the valley I'd like to

1327
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:36,880
encode that comment I think if you look

1328
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,980
at if you go back to the next slide

1329
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,230
please

1330
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:43,059
so many of these proposals I remember

1331
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:46,389
you know you have discuss this war so

1332
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:49,540
light-years right but you know when did

1333
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:51,640
thought though the consensus of the room

1334
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:55,690
there was general interest for doing

1335
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:57,700
that work so now I think you know but we

1336
01:26:55,690 --> 01:27:00,009
haven't properly closed it right whether

1337
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:01,630
we haven't issued an eruption call or

1338
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:03,910
any of those work items right

1339
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:07,120
so my recommendation would be like you

1340
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:08,889
know delay this decision to do this here

1341
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:11,050
and some other group it's your decision

1342
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:13,960
but some of these work items have

1343
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:16,810
relevance in my opinion so maybe instead

1344
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,970
of 106 maybe move this discussion let's

1345
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:20,800
make sure this proper participation also

1346
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:22,990
today the attendance is somewhat very

1347
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:25,060
light there's also some other Bop going

1348
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:26,410
on I think for multiple reasons my

1349
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:28,980
recommendation would be to just delay

1350
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:28,980
this decision

1351
01:27:32,139 --> 01:27:38,809
yeah cool urban AG again so I will not

1352
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:40,249
make a decision right now you have a

1353
01:27:38,809 --> 01:27:42,499
chance and we do that for everything

1354
01:27:40,249 --> 01:27:43,610
that you can continue any discussion in

1355
01:27:42,499 --> 01:27:45,800
the meeting Justin that we want to

1356
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:47,960
confirm anything on the maintenance so

1357
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:52,400
you should do that on the mainest if you

1358
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:53,929
want to do it regarding you just said

1359
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,239
some of these items have support and

1360
01:27:53,929 --> 01:27:57,409
they are light that's great we can do

1361
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,909
them we don't have to do them in this

1362
01:27:57,409 --> 01:28:00,768
mainly in this working group right

1363
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:02,659
but like the more important part is it's

1364
01:28:00,769 --> 01:28:05,030
not enough it only that you also support

1365
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:06,768
it you need people who are reviewing

1366
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,869
this who are implementing this were

1367
01:28:06,769 --> 01:28:11,030
contributing to it right if we have 10

1368
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:12,380
items and each of the items has only the

1369
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:15,219
officers contributing to it it's not

1370
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:15,219
helpful at all

1371
01:28:22,869 --> 01:28:32,089
