2
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:52,510
welcome back to our second session on

3
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:54,010
debt net we are our first speaker up

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,739
just walked in the room so it's perfect

5
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,839
timing

6
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,449
I'm Lou burger this is young far coughs

7
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:09,580
my co-chair we have Ethan Grossman still

8
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:12,460
remote for the as is the case for all

9
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,960
IETF sessions our work here is covered

10
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:20,399
by our contribution guidelines that is

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,619
summarized in the note well if you're

12
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:28,929
unfamiliar with it please visit the URL

13
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:30,759
on the bottom of the page basically

14
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:33,630
everything you say here becomes part of

15
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,940
our permanent record and in fact we are

16
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,929
recording with video as well as

17
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,640
transmitting we and we have

18
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,569
collaborative note-taking taking place

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,969
on etherpad

20
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:48,159
please feel free to join in make sure

21
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:51,669
your comments your name is appropriately

22
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,159
captured and I'll do my best to relay

23
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,880
comments made by Jabbar with that we're

24
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:03,640
gonna jump into the agenda first up is

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:06,850
Greg mirskiy we have a separate news we

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:17,170
have a new blue sheets for their second

27
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:21,430
session so please sign oh thank you

28
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:28,720
first okay you wanna yeah here's some

29
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:30,840
substance historically its first thank

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,840
you

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:44,610
okay um we were presenting and

32
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:49,920
discussing document and then based on

33
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,760
how work on detling data plane is

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,670
ongoing

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,060
I was suggested to split this document

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:01,910
and specifically for the there was data

37
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:06,510
plane case and for the IEP so this is

38
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:10,260
presentation on MPLS they deplane

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:15,690
deterministic networks did with plane

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,540
and am so we had comments from Pascal we

41
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,030
addressed them and discussed and we took

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,350
their death net or a.m. document was

43
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:31,710
splitted in two and because of changes

44
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:34,650
in or how the impellers data p.m.

45
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:38,130
document progresses we removed the

46
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:49,050
optional years of Gail gash so it uses

47
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:53,970
only to the Royal VC C D so the D

48
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:57,110
control mode the sequence number and it

49
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,520
ensures that packet replication

50
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:08,200
duplicate elimination and all the

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:19,410
preservation functions work what we are

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:26,860
this document is to take control word

53
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:30,389
ACH from to the wire and use the

54
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:35,530
reserved field for the sequence number

55
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:40,510
so we're defining that associated

56
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:45,369
channel header which the first label is

57
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:48,940
one then the version the current version

58
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:52,990
is zero the sequence number is a food

59
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:56,290
that would be monotonically increment it

60
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,560
and the channel type the channel that we

61
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:05,139
use from Ayana to the wire associated

62
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:11,169
channel called points the sequence

63
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:13,539
number is needed so that death net or

64
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:16,320
a.m. can experience the same treatment

65
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:25,330
by packet or application elimination and

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:31,030
or the preservation function and you can

67
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:38,500
see that basically with this sequence

68
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:49,239
number if we have taken to replication

69
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:55,260
in n1 + r4 then the packet that has the

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:58,900
prime science so then they could go and

71
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:02,919
elimination in r2 will choose for

72
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:07,000
example the original packet and all

73
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:11,650
prime will be dropped and when the

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,140
packet elimination function in n2 will

75
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:19,440
probably choose copy' armed with two

76
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,440
primes

77
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:27,799
that's because that net om will have a

78
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:31,349
sequence number so this packets can be

79
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:34,230
compared and acted functions will work

80
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:40,410
on them as they work on adjust net net

81
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:44,010
flow so what's the next step because

82
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:48,900
there are documents that consider of how

83
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:51,960
MPLS works over all with IP UDP tunnel

84
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,710
and where the TSN domain will continue

85
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,250
this work to address specific what what

86
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:01,680
specifics can be for this scenarios we

87
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:06,000
welcome your comments suggestions and

88
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,460
questions always and very grateful for

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,380
them and we would like to ask for

90
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:17,450
consideration to consider of working

91
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:17,450
reproduction of this document comments

92
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm oh that's really funny

93
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,940
I was looking to Stuart and then looking

94
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,260
for Andy in the room of course and he's

95
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,440
not in the room and I looked down and

96
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,010
yes he's at the my queue so I will read

97
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,770
his question question for Greg this is

98
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,050
from anomalous the graph needs to

99
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,620
specify if the sequence number goes

100
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,890
through zero or not for example 255 0 1

101
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:52,710
255 1 this is currently not specified so

102
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:57,630
a technical comment right yes

103
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,729
the sickness number may read but my

104
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,790
understanding is that for packet

105
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:09,639
replication and in the nation functions

106
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:12,219
that is not critical because my

107
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,650
stop-in document is very specific on

108
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:18,340
what happens and perhaps tellurium

109
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:21,580
should follow okay then then I will need

110
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,239
to read because I missed that part okay

111
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,770
great thank you

112
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:33,880
comments any other comments from the

113
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:39,130
floor do people think this document is

114
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:41,588
headed in the right direction not

115
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:45,100
getting a lot of responses how many

116
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:49,540
people have read this document it's a

117
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,190
pretty small number I was assuming the

118
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,569
answer to the next question which I

119
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,220
usually asked so maybe I should have

120
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,060
started there how many think we should

121
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:02,199
be working on Oh a.m. for NPR mpls debt

122
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,689
net data play that's it's not a huge

123
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:06,729
number but it's a reasonable number that

124
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,930
was I actually had made the assumption

125
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,130
that this was something that the working

126
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,890
group would want to work on but I should

127
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,750
have asked my apologies

128
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,329
so the next question was how many read

129
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,949
we already saw that there's very few III

130
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,750
don't think we can do much right now

131
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:22,750
with the amount of people that we've had

132
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,149
read the document so really like to ask

133
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,730
people to to read the document comment

134
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,140
on the list think of it talk about

135
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,399
whether you think it's an headed in the

136
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,490
right direction or the wrong direction

137
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,010
that'd be really useful

138
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,690
just do it to make progress before the

139
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,939
next meeting maybe we should schedule it

140
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,160
for a sort of a an interim of some sort

141
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,110
just to do a proper review yeah one of

142
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,149
the that that's an interesting idea the

143
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,860
other thing and I haven't talked to

144
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:49,449
Janos about it so we got a synchronize

145
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,970
on this point you know one of the things

146
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:54,250
I'm I was thinking is is we could do an

147
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,649
adoption poll with an understanding that

148
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,690
if it fails it's not that it's dead so

149
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:02,050
normally when we do an adoption poll if

150
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,630
it's rejected that topic is closed and

151
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,660
we don't revisit it we could do an

152
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,189
adoption poll which is has with an

153
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,689
understanding that it's it's really

154
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,279
about is this headed in the right

155
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,279
direction and then we can come back and

156
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,760
do it again we can do both of those yeah

157
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,560
so we'll talk offline you know I think I

158
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,910
think there is general agreement that

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,290
this is something that working group

160
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,170
wants to work on

161
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,329
it's just it's just this is whether or

162
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:35,219
not there's any support for your

163
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:38,680
specific solution and again from the

164
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,240
jabber Andy has both read the document

165
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,280
and think we should be working on it

166
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,090
there's a nice thick that means the

167
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:55,319
topic thank you okay I'll can you switch

168
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:55,320
to from P so now we're moving on to IP

169
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:10,479
okay so this is a proportion and after

170
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:15,689
reading some drafts that discuss that

171
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:22,600
net over IP and relationship of IP UDP

172
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:25,530
with the MPLS and TSM so we decided that

173
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,930
for now it's an informational document

174
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:31,959
because since packet replication and

175
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:36,459
elimination functions are not envisioned

176
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:40,540
in IP in that net over IP then we

177
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:46,750
believe that all known IP OEM should

178
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:53,260
work and that's probably period so for

179
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:56,170
now we are moving as informational

180
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,390
document the concern or the question

181
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,430
that we would like the working group to

182
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:04,900
discuss and we will need to reflect that

183
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:09,689
here is that the definition of death net

184
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:13,770
flow in IP identified by six double IP

185
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:19,080
or en protocols use our different

186
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:23,260
well-known destination ports associating

187
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:27,070
IP OEM with a particular death net flow

188
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:31,030
and ensuring that they are corroded so

189
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:34,320
traverse the same nodes and links in IP

190
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,560
network not in a channels in IP networks

191
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,460
maple

192
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,279
a problem so we might need to have some

193
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,440
warning might be in this document or in

194
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,210
the data plane document actually if we

195
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,720
make it in the data claim document this

196
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:55,060
document might be not needed but we will

197
00:12:49,720 --> 00:13:00,520
need to really explain how that can work

198
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:13,839
so that I am is faith sharing with it

199
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:15,730
flow it monitors I'm holding the

200
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,980
dramatic purpose because I see David

201
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,470
that sounds like an accurate problem

202
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,410
description um David David you have

203
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:27,610
another slide talking about solutions

204
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:30,850
well that's what they have basically we

205
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:34,420
can only say that IPO M has to be mapped

206
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:38,950
with a dead net flow it might be just

207
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:42,910
some management tools that you have to

208
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:50,070
say that this flow and this flow will

209
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:54,219
have to go on this route frankly if

210
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:58,839
there is not much if there is a ECM pian

211
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:02,770
I P network and if that net allows to be

212
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:06,010
work or may work in a CMP environment in

213
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:10,510
IP network then it might become a more

214
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:12,760
problem so the table black David image

215
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:20,380
reaction was out great is completely

216
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:24,010
correct so so only the current about

217
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,540
congruent routing stuff we had we had in

218
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,569
the flow information whether we come so

219
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,030
far to the two directions to becoming

220
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,279
congruent but and and introducing

221
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,650
parameters for that like flow ID

222
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,990
management parameters like floor ID and

223
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:42,400
so on we may consider extending it to

224
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:44,830
the VIP and maybe give a different name

225
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,600
or something to make it sure or use

226
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,050
those

227
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,680
that the OEM flow goes along the same

228
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:55,740
way as it's more than just the same wake

229
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,969
a David thereby can concrete example

230
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,010
suppose that the debt net 40 plane is

231
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,810
fouled up at a node but the IP

232
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:08,880
forwarding plane is not the OEM traffic

233
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,979
BFD cannot be betrayed

234
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,380
traceroute in particular has got to go

235
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,150
through the detonate forwarding plane to

236
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,470
tell you where the broken node is

237
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,880
because you send it through the IP

238
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,360
forwarding plane will incorrectly tell

239
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,640
you everything's okay I David I thought

240
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,610
you were also going to make the point

241
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:29,040
that you you also have to get into the

242
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,470
right queues because there's a whole

243
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
queueing behavior property and part of

244
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,010
forwarding plane yeah yeah yeah that's

245
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,850
that's that that's absolute foreign

246
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:41,720
plane so in queue speak if the debt net

247
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,040
queue is broken in a node and the

248
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,370
corresponding queue for that pair of IP

249
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,770
addresses is functioning and you send

250
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,960
traceroute in a fashion that doesn't get

251
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,460
into the decnet queue traceroute will

252
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:01,850
fail to fight will fail to find the

253
00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:06,210
problem I think those this is norm Finn

254
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,990
it's it's not it's not trivial to to get

255
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:13,290
the OEM to follow the IP I know then I

256
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:18,540
agree and it's not trivial to get it

257
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:21,530
treated with the same QoS make sure it

258
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,709
goes in the same queues and so on well

259
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:29,160
actually that's that's that's that's

260
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:33,600
again if if the flow is identified by

261
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,000
six topple and that controls to which

262
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,600
you it goes sure yes I understand but

263
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,300
that is otherwise well you can if we

264
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,400
cannot make it happen then Oh am doesn't

265
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,680
serve its purpose right of course

266
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:52,050
so in an in theory you we should be able

267
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:55,709
to say this OEM this this we have to be

268
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:59,089
able to look at the OEM and tell which

269
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,090
flow the OEM is for

270
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:08,790
okay that it's so there's there's

271
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:12,270
there's an oem flow per vetnet flow

272
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:15,420
right at some point yes it can be the

273
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,879
case right so there's an oem flow for

274
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,150
debt net flow so we have to be able to

275
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,220
look at the OEM packet and say ah that

276
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,080
goes with this debt net flow and this

277
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,820
back and so it gets this debt net flow

278
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:32,730
service and and so on and the other part

279
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,520
of that is that we have to allow for the

280
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,040
bandwidth of the OEM in the reservation

281
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,250
for the flow which means we have to be

282
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:45,090
very very sure that the OEM is limited

283
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:49,410
in bandwidth and you know conforms to

284
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:52,250
whatever rules we have for for the flow

285
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,250
itself Oh

286
00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:06,929
something to think about is that with

287
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:09,390
the packet replication for example you

288
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,930
can argue that the sequence number

289
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:15,380
allows the data flow itself to be the

290
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,420
OEM now you don't get all the functions

291
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,960
okay but you certainly get connectivity

292
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,580
and if you have two paths and I'm

293
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,080
receiving it on one path and I'm not

294
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,379
receiving it on the other path I know

295
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:32,639
something's wrong and it's not just that

296
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:36,270
the source stopped so just know I

297
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,280
understand this is just IP sorry sorry

298
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,720
that's only if you can that's only if

299
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,970
you have the two paths yeah thank you

300
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:47,310
right again I I think it's a very good

301
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:51,920
suggestion to use what's called hybrid

302
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:55,860
or air methods so using the wire traffic

303
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,200
they're some advantages but in my

304
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:03,330
experience it's a good complementary to

305
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:05,940
it does not substitute for active for am

306
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,040
where the packets are specially

307
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,620
specifically constructed for the test

308
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:16,000
purposes and there are many cases

309
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:18,729
for now IP does or at least appears to

310
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,419
have some issues that we need to discuss

311
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:25,720
and define and faith sharing is reported

312
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:28,440
so also because there are some the

313
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,340
number of documents that explain how

314
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:38,110
that let IP works over MPLS and/or with

315
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:40,840
TCM so what we point out is that there

316
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:45,428
are two scenarios to work in regard to

317
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:48,189
our OEM so first its if it's a tunneling

318
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:50,470
and second one it's it's appearing you

319
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:55,720
can see inter working so we might have

320
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:59,049
just look at TSM or MPLS that let and

321
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,360
know as the means as one hop or we might

322
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:06,129
need to inter work to provide end-to-end

323
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,870
OAM but that bit so there is another

324
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,120
technology I mean I don't really see how

325
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,010
we solve it in classical IP without some

326
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,799
help somewhere or other because we've

327
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:18,039
never been able to solve the problem of

328
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:20,529
making the paths congruent with with IP

329
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:22,419
but what we could do and what we

330
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,669
probably need to do anyway is to

331
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:29,679
introduce an explicit routing technology

332
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:31,630
of which there are several candidates on

333
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,330
the one hand this SL on the other hand

334
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:40,200
there's something like PPR or there is

335
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,610
that's rsvp-te which was discussed RSVP

336
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,260
and they'd a working group actually

337
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,229
so there's actually there's act was

338
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,658
actually about four or five solutions

339
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,789
for explicit path and with others

340
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,230
there's also the PCE based language is

341
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,419
one we've always talked about yeah yeah

342
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,710
yeah I mean you know I mean listen all

343
00:20:55,419 --> 00:21:00,610
over anyway there are a load of

344
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,470
solutions and we probably need one of

345
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,899
those in place once one of those is in

346
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,029
place to support debt NER to make it a

347
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:10,449
bit more controlled than the OEM will

348
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,919
naturally be paid sharing so I miss

349
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,980
through it that we've actually been here

350
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,130
before with MPLS and as you may remember

351
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,010
we talked about using sort of companion

352
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:24,159
labels that were Co routed and had

353
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,330
shared resources and we talked about in

354
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,320
that in that context

355
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:31,629
that that still wasn't adequate because

356
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,750
you might have something in your your

357
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,970
label database get corrupted so just

358
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,950
because you use the same forwarding

359
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,200
identifier or you use different sorry

360
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,410
you use the same resources and the same

361
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,230
paths because you use different traffic

362
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:50,230
classification identifiers I'll be your

363
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,270
OEM still may not succeed which is part

364
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,880
of the reason why we ended up with - and

365
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,950
gal so you know we've been bit we've

366
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,130
been here before let's not forget those

367
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:03,160
lessons right but certainly we can do

368
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:07,120
some things like like resource sharing

369
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,860
and and congruent paths yeah I remember

370
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,189
you have to have the same key all the

371
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,449
same queuing stuff you serve Klaus and

372
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:21,400
all those sorts of things no it's worse

373
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:24,400
ICMP ICMP is a crucial part of IP OEM it

374
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,070
has none of that so so you have to set

375
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,580
the explicit path such that the source

376
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,919
destination pair is the is the trigger

377
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:37,870
not a richer set of information in the

378
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:40,150
packet right if if you correct if if you

379
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:43,179
do your traffic you're getting it

380
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,610
traffic's currently slice selection at a

381
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,460
get NIT node based solely on IP source

382
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:52,120
address pair then you'll pick up ICMP

383
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:57,220
get get fancier than that and things

384
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:59,770
start to get risky fast technology of

385
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,600
one of the paths and he brought ipv6

386
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:05,889
where you've got so many addresses you

387
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,800
can throw them away in in large quantity

388
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,020
then that's not a problem so I think

389
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,510
we've hit the point where it makes sense

390
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:18,400
to ask similar questions like we did for

391
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:21,310
MPLS does the group but go ahead yeah I

392
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,820
actually well how many more slides did

393
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:29,200
you have no no that's what no one side

394
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:31,450
actually I'm very excited that you

395
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,690
decided to go to these questions because

396
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,700
we have not thought about it that we'll

397
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,080
be asking for the working group adoption

398
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,669
well we're not asking for working group

399
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,168
adoption

400
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:43,129
what we're asking is is this a problem

401
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:48,779
the working group even wants to work on

402
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:50,488
so is IP om for IP debt net something

403
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:56,460
the working group would like to spend

404
00:23:50,489 --> 00:24:00,059
energy on spend time on if interested

405
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:03,059
put up your hand I would say that this

406
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:05,789
is still a reasonable number it is

407
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,649
definitely less than in the MPLS case

408
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:09,090
which frankly I'm surprised that I

409
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:13,289
thought it would be the same if not more

410
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:15,779
I rather read the room wrong you all

411
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:18,658
MPLS is an easier problem yes ok we have

412
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,940
a question of mic so the point I would

413
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:24,450
make is the stores potentially is much

414
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,369
much broader than just that net because

415
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,529
actually we don't have a first-class IP

416
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,600
OAM that we that has these properties

417
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:32,730
our forwarding behavior is different

418
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,389
than normal

419
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:38,129
IP and so we definitely have a different

420
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:42,149
problem and we also have different

421
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:44,158
techniques available to us for for

422
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:48,928
example part of our architecture is that

423
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:52,379
all of our IP six tupled flows are

424
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:53,639
explicitly controlled and so we can we

425
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:55,259
can push some things on the control

426
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:57,090
plane and place additional requirements

427
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,379
on the control plane that doesn't of

428
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,359
course answer what we're doing in the

429
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:02,129
data plane but we we have some different

430
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,619
tools sure we have a mo constrained

431
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:06,418
problem but nonetheless this is part of

432
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:11,970
a much wider problem the ITF hasn't

433
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:14,850
solved I think that what's to say is

434
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:17,100
that what we are monitoring into what

435
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,039
we're measuring we don't know where it

436
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,748
is in the network so we're knowing that

437
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,539
we're doing it between two points we

438
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:28,889
don't know which path this probes test

439
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:34,619
packets are traversing um

440
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:38,729
Norvin I'm very much interested in I'm

441
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:41,009
more interested in the the plain IP o am

442
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:45,040
then I am in MPLS because I feel like

443
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:50,200
the MPLS OEM is not very hard

444
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:53,050
so this is a lot more fun problem so if

445
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:57,730
if so if somebody comes up with a

446
00:25:53,050 --> 00:26:01,510
plausible solution I want to hear about

447
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:05,680
it but so I'm just waiting to hear a

448
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,780
plausible solution so at this point like

449
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,190
to suggest that the folks who are

450
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,830
interested in working on it

451
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,850
self-organized yeah and and let's see

452
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:18,399
what they come up with

453
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:21,280
so the greg has nominated yourself by

454
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,550
writing this document okay to coordinate

455
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,070
the activity but let's see if we can get

456
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:32,680
some critical mass of thinking on it and

457
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:37,600
just like on the being discussion if you

458
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:40,150
want to have a a the working group WebEx

459
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,030
to have informal meetings you can do

460
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,880
that that book is saying we will just

461
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,399
contact the chairs and we'll set you up

462
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,040
the other thing is is if you would like

463
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,980
to ask for an interim on this we can

464
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,889
also do that but we'd like to ask first

465
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,470
to do the self organizing thing and let

466
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,940
us know how we the chairs can support

467
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,790
the working group thank you

468
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,790
and with that you're actually at a time

469
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:14,950
you're fine you're fine

470
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:17,490
here thank you now we really are in the

471
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,490
control plane

472
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:37,480
actually in the beginning Andy will give

473
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:42,310
this presentation but considering that

474
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:45,760
he's not here so I am also in this work

475
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:49,000
so I will do the presentation and here

476
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,170
is I will work about the net controller

477
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,160
plan framework here is the background

478
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:59,320
actually although that then that control

479
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,180
all controller plan is not in the

480
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,970
chatter of the current and networking

481
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:06,370
group but this part of work is not

482
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,770
totally out of the sight of the net

483
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,770
because in then at the architecture

484
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:14,650
there is a section about the controller

485
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:18,629
plan a corresponding to the aggregation

486
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:19,750
of the control and management in fc7

487
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,870
4:26

488
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:26,500
and also in the tenant data plan draft

489
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:29,729
we can see in the previous presentations

490
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,960
that there are a lot of controller plan

491
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:37,270
considerations included in the current

492
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:40,660
draft so we are not this working we are

493
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,850
not zero we have something but the

494
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:46,000
purpose of this draft is that we want to

495
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:49,540
summary all these efforts about general

496
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,420
controller plan and also the requirement

497
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,030
in one place and we want to provide an

498
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,060
overview of the possible solutions for

499
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,940
the net control plan especially in the

500
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,360
architecture it can be a distributed

501
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,460
system with signaling protocol it can be

502
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,070
a fully centralized the controller

503
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:13,410
weather controller as the in system or

504
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:15,790
it can be a hybrid control plan a signal

505
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:19,210
signaling protocol and also have a

506
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:22,379
controller they work together this also

507
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:27,100
aligns with a work in actuallyI

508
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:31,560
the draft QC c is also have the similar

509
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:36,219
structure these three class classes and

510
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:38,740
also we want to discuss some control

511
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,900
plant issues that are unique to that for

512
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:44,460
example we have to build up explicit

513
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,400
pathway

514
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,960
resource reservation or we have to build

515
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:57,370
up explicit paths with PR yo F and we

516
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,370
have also some discussions about done as

517
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:04,629
integration with the existing control

518
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:08,610
plans for example the RMP is IP or as

519
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:11,710
our seminal routing things so and also a

520
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:14,530
Greg have some very great work about

521
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:17,350
this part the management plan issues

522
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:21,970
unique to ten that should also be

523
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:25,419
considered so what is the next actually

524
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:29,800
a we are not sure because the networking

525
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:33,160
group is not currently chattered to work

526
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,020
on the control plan now we just do the

527
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,990
work about the architecture the data

528
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:42,250
plan and the information model that data

529
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:44,610
data model yamoto so we are wondering

530
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,170
whether the controller plan solution is

531
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,449
also needed in the working group and

532
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,450
though whether the working group is

533
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:57,100
going to reach had her about this part

534
00:30:52,450 --> 00:31:03,910
of work to make this discussions happen

535
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:07,300
in the working group and so we of course

536
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:10,570
the comments review or questions are

537
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:13,780
welcome and also we want some feedback

538
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:19,000
from the working group what will what

539
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:21,700
should be done next that's all so from a

540
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,060
I just looked at the architect that they

541
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,320
sorry the Charter again to make sure

542
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,480
that what I was going to say is right I

543
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,370
think it is and I'll also look to

544
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:36,580
Deborah re D to respond to this maybe

545
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,810
not right now but afterwards after she

546
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,120
takes a look at the Charter again and

547
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,399
thanks about it but as I read the

548
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,129
Charter we are certainly not chartered

549
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,960
to do control playing solutions yes we

550
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,580
are chartered to do the management and

551
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,710
control architecture and make sure that

552
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,870
we have the right information that we

553
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:56,770
identify the information needed and the

554
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,909
management and control plane so part of

555
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,940
the document I think

556
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:03,970
is in scope there's another part that is

557
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:07,510
not in scope so going going and

558
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,240
identifying the possibilities and the

559
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:13,570
possible solutions sorry the possible

560
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,340
ways you know distributed or centralized

561
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,669
in multiple ways of controlling debt net

562
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:23,740
I read our charter is allowing that in

563
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:27,090
in terms of even identifying gaps in

564
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,800
control plane solutions I think is is

565
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:31,510
within our charter at least as I read it

566
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,000
and I'm I'm making sure our ad is

567
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:37,120
listening so she can she can tell me I'm

568
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,150
wrong now if we get to the point of

569
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,110
saying we've identified this and here's

570
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,460
our solution I think we've gone too far

571
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,110
what we would need to do is go to the

572
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,350
right working groups and talk to those

573
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,540
group groups about the solutions so in

574
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,790
terms of talking about the part of the

575
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:58,330
solution space the architecture for

576
00:32:54,790 --> 00:33:02,409
control that's certainly there talking

577
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:04,540
about what specific technologies are

578
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,310
available I think I think we're on safe

579
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,800
ground and you're doing that so I think

580
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,169
most of this document were in good in

581
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,760
okay place to have that discussion

582
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,280
there are definitely places where you're

583
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:19,600
saying let's solve it this way that yeah

584
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,280
that's too far okay Stuart so I'm a bit

585
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,770
worried that we've got cops feeding

586
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,290
horses here because if we need to do a

587
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:29,050
control plane solution which I think we

588
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,490
do we do need a mecca needs to be in

589
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,470
someone's charter to do it

590
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,330
we shouldn't stall this whole program we

591
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,070
have we have three or four working

592
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:40,240
groups who have a charter of doing

593
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:43,450
control playing an outing area so I

594
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,480
think we can probably ask them say you

595
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,250
own this protocol we see a gap do you

596
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,870
want to fill it and it certainly if they

597
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,660
come back and say no I think we have a

598
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,370
really strong reason to go to the isg

599
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:57,100
and say we should change our charter to

600
00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:00,129
allow us to do it okay but maybe somehow

601
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,919
Oh need to get past that reasonably soon

602
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,780
and if the original reason for not doing

603
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,880
control plane work is because we wanted

604
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,529
to get the data plane or I reckon we got

605
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,450
the data plane in as good a shape as we

606
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,250
can and it will be really useful to

607
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,439
start

608
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,449
early work on this other stuff so that

609
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,918
we aren't yet because you know it takes

610
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:20,609
a time when you need to think your way

611
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:23,638
through it and I think most of what the

612
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:25,820
document is doing today actually is it

613
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,200
really helpful in your that discussion

614
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,460
it we should get the structural and

615
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,949
administrative reasons for not doing

616
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,320
control playing out locate some be clear

617
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:36,779
it's the specification of the control

618
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,580
plane solutions everything up to that

619
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:43,740
point which is like 98% of this document

620
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,270
we can do here it's really the point

621
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,339
that says I mean I think there was like

622
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,409
two sections things got into solutions

623
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,720
all right as long as we got a pop that

624
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,419
seamlessly get one to control plane some

625
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,908
way so one of the interesting things

626
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:00,540
that happened or earlier this week in

627
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:04,400
tease is there was a proposal for doing

628
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,890
traffic engineering for IP flows and I

629
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,980
asked about bringing in supporting the

630
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:13,620
debt net IPE flow and the authors were

631
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,950
receptive so we may actually end up with

632
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,839
a solution that we can use before we've

633
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:25,470
even talked about the framework for it

634
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:29,220
so so Blue Ensign a quick comment so

635
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:32,839
given the situation where we have a good

636
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:39,480
document what Lou has their printed out

637
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:44,220
it's 98% correct I said if you go in

638
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:48,330
Skokie 80% correct in scope its its

639
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,370
scope is 98% correct it's not it's more

640
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:54,049
to do to the document but it's a good

641
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:57,299
document the the problem I have here is

642
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:01,830
when Lou says we should give it to those

643
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:05,190
are the working groups what is the is it

644
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,840
the debt networking group shares that

645
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:10,950
actually going to take that initiative

646
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:15,390
or not if we get to when we get to the

647
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:17,580
point of identifying shortcomings and we

648
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,930
start talking about solutions it's at

649
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,000
that point I think we need to coordinate

650
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:24,810
with the a B and the other other chairs

651
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,660
about how to how to go forward

652
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:30,330
we don't we're not quite there yet if if

653
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:33,240
now we're at the point where people are

654
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,670
bringing contributions of control

655
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,069
playing solution documents we can have

656
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:41,370
that the discussion in specific rather

657
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:44,190
than abstract by the way Andy malice had

658
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,210
one comment in response to I think what

659
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,670
I was talking about earlier with the

660
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:50,460
Charter his feeling was he was being

661
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,490
conservative in the reading of the

662
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,560
Charter were it since control playing

663
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,089
solutions were not there I guess he was

664
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,370
reading it as we couldn't even talk

665
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:03,780
about control plane which you know that

666
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:06,180
the community the just to be you know

667
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,370
clear you start out and talk about the

668
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,319
second line in the Charter it says the

669
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,540
work encompasses the data playing the

670
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,510
data playing OAM time synchronization

671
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:18,240
management control and security aspects

672
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,920
referring of debt net so control

673
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,350
management controls what we've called

674
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,730
the controller plane so you know from

675
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,580
the architecture level from the high

676
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,410
level that is certainly in scope so I'm

677
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,900
still a little bit concerned that you're

678
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,520
actually pushing it way too out I'll see

679
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,950
the two sections that you pointed out

680
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,970
that were given too far they are an

681
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,850
indication that this is already

682
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:44,549
happening now so it should be proactive

683
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:47,730
and take that decision take that action

684
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,200
now to start discussing within the

685
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:54,270
working group that we actually need to

686
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:57,089
be involved I I think the next step is

687
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,890
to get some proposed some proposals on

688
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,570
the table around rather than talk and

689
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,480
theoretical x' let's see the documents

690
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,770
and figure out where where they belong

691
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,210
so if someone has a control plane

692
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,580
solution they've been hanging back

693
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,140
holding back on bring it forward and

694
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,319
then we'll figure out where it where it

695
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,319
goes

696
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,800
contribute it somewhere could bring it

697
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,240
into the IETF and if it's in the wrong

698
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,780
working group we'll get into the right

699
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,029
working group as you said let's let's

700
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:28,740
not let's not hold up on process let's

701
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:32,790
get the documents submitted so Erik gray

702
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,189
Erickson I'm gonna point out the

703
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:37,930
elephant that we're all dancing around

704
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:40,150
lose already kind of hinted at it we

705
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,190
we could possibly have this work already

706
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:46,480
beginning to start in the TS working

707
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:49,030
group that's Lou talking to Luke so I

708
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:56,010
mean really this is not as complicated

709
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:58,839
as we seem to be trying to make yeah so

710
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:02,950
we have a document on the table that is

711
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,680
titled framework not solution so it's a

712
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:11,618
framework document on the controller

713
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:14,109
plane does like to gauge the feeling of

714
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:17,250
the working group on whether the working

715
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:19,440
group should be spending time on the

716
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,690
architecture and framework level

717
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,339
discussions of the controller plane so

718
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,589
again this is something that's in scope

719
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:29,790
revert Charter do we want to spend time

720
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:32,020
on it who's interested in doing that

721
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,910
I'm not even to look down to see if

722
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,550
jabber for Andy's hand is up I'm sure it

723
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:41,500
is so should we be working on the topic

724
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:43,809
of controller plane it's a similar

725
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,420
number to the previous one and a similar

726
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:49,000
comment there there's a reasonable

727
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:52,869
there's some some number there but

728
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,910
frankly it's smaller than I expected but

729
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:56,859
that's okay so there's some who thinks

730
00:39:54,910 --> 00:40:02,799
we should not be spending any time on

731
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:06,098
this topic no one okay so that's that's

732
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:09,790
useful information so I think for this

733
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:11,740
document it would be good to carve out

734
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,910
anything that a solution specifics and

735
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,609
if you have some solutions that you

736
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,190
think are necessary write them up and

737
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:20,078
submit them separately but let's

738
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:23,530
continue talking about the the document

739
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,589
in the working group okay but in my

740
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,839
personal opinion I think if we just have

741
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:32,160
a line about what to do and what not to

742
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:36,130
do first it will be very clear because

743
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:40,259
in for example in this document we can

744
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:44,200
point out which which section it's not

745
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,920
in the current chatter don't worry about

746
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:50,169
charter we worry about the technology in

747
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,460
this document feel free to talk about

748
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,790
what what is Miss

749
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,760
Singh mm-hmm don't put solutions in this

750
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,560
document okay do put solution if you

751
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,110
have a solution to brain put it in

752
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,850
another document okay contribute it to

753
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,010
one of the working groups that you think

754
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,569
is appropriate and the chairs will

755
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,010
figure out where it goes and between the

756
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,080
ad will figure out where it goes the

757
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,610
biggest thing is contribute it bring it

758
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:18,700
to the table let's get the discussions

759
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:21,730
going so what is the point or purpose of

760
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,740
the current draft perhaps it's just kind

761
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:30,010
of the requirement for than that control

762
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:31,569
plan is that the right direction what

763
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:38,040
you're asking me the purpose of your

764
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:42,160
document so it's a little without the

765
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,310
detailed discussions about the Pacific a

766
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,319
solution may be in the left part is the

767
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,000
requirement right so we've had other

768
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,040
documents in other work groups I've even

769
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,480
written some which go through and say

770
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,370
here's the set of things we need from

771
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,930
the control plane and here's what's

772
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,880
missing so it almost becomes a gap

773
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,520
analysis document those are very useful

774
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,140
documents ok so there's nothing and

775
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,880
you're doing that you're talking and

776
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,490
talking about what the options are and

777
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:10,540
where the gaps are that helps guide the

778
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:18,419
work that gets done so that's useful for

779
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:22,150
me and yeah their comments okay

780
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,770
and I I do note that our ad did not get

781
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:28,590
up and shout at us so that's this is a

782
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,590
good result thank you

783
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:50,299
i'm leon from china mobile and one of

784
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:54,589
the author of the ring topology draft

785
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:57,619
and today I'm going to present as the

786
00:42:54,589 --> 00:43:02,779
author and with the update from last

787
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:06,650
night's meeting so the update in this

788
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:08,960
fourth zero full version mainly is the

789
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,779
alignment of this draft OS the

790
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,390
architectural draft so basically we use

791
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:19,430
the terms that are defined in internet

792
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:22,690
architecture so and it's also support

793
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:26,779
the packet world of function and use the

794
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:30,710
defined F label s label service level

795
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:34,190
and the control world in data net

796
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:37,430
architecture the presentation will be

797
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:41,390
very short because I'm going to only

798
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:45,410
talk about the updates so the first one

799
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:47,839
is in the single ring situation where

800
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:53,029
you have a point-to-multipoint detonate

801
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,910
service the document basically show in

802
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:59,509
the ingress and egress a node of the

803
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:02,660
Ring what type of function in terms of

804
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:06,200
the replication elimination and

805
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:10,640
reordering is needed so first for this

806
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:14,210
particular example and in the ingress

807
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,150
node which is a in here you will need to

808
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:23,930
support the nodes of support the

809
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:27,799
replication function and for for the

810
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:31,569
leaf node in C D and F in this

811
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:34,519
particular case the node need to support

812
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:41,058
application and elimination and

813
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:43,640
reordering if needed so this is

814
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:48,799
basically the idea so for for for the

815
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:53,480
egress node you basically read out the

816
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:55,700
service read out the forwarding label to

817
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,589
determine whether this is the

818
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:01,368
fruit and this is the packet you need to

819
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:04,730
help out and then you the node basically

820
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:08,270
the service label to distinguish which

821
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:10,970
service which definite service it is and

822
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:13,780
then to decide whether it needs to be

823
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:18,859
reordered according to the control world

824
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:21,079
and in a more complicated situation

825
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:23,119
where you have a interactive you have

826
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:26,390
interconnected rings and in this

827
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:31,400
particular case you have two

828
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:35,410
interconnected node and to put in a

829
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:39,530
short in this diagram basically the

830
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:41,660
upper node in the interconnected area

831
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:46,089
will

832
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:49,368
we'll deal with the clockwise wrote and

833
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:52,910
the bottom one will deal with the

834
00:45:49,369 --> 00:46:02,750
counterclockwise known so to be more in

835
00:45:52,910 --> 00:46:06,890
detail the the i1 know when they receive

836
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:09,920
the packet from be it will basically

837
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:12,049
forward a to pef the elimination

838
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,319
function and the e-mini function will

839
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:19,040
read out the packet and then replicate

840
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:24,680
it again to the ring on the right hand

841
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:30,200
side on the clock rise on a clockwise

842
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:33,740
vote and then if the I too received a

843
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,379
packet either from clockwise or

844
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:40,000
counterclockwise on the left hand side

845
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,369
ring and it will basically replicate the

846
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,970
eliminate eliminate the packet first and

847
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:49,549
then replicate the packet on the ring on

848
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:56,000
the right hand side on the

849
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:58,849
counterclockwise wrote and the other

850
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,619
mechanism are all the same for single

851
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:06,160
ring for the packet on the rain either

852
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:09,580
on the left hand side or ring on the

853
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:18,279
right hand side ray

854
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:22,410
yep so summary the ring topology is very

855
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:26,020
important for for long-haul transmission

856
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:29,109
basically we're going to see and these

857
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:32,800
type of ring topology very frequently in

858
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:36,100
a network for long haul so we think it

859
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,260
is very important for data net up to

860
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:41,860
four week or for people to understand

861
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:46,200
and to know how we should configure the

862
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:49,720
ring topology for detonates services and

863
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:52,299
basically rain topology intrinsically

864
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,330
give you the protection with clockwise

865
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:58,090
and counterclockwise route at the same

866
00:47:55,330 --> 00:48:00,940
time and and it's more efficient because

867
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:04,710
it's only two copies of the packets to

868
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:10,510
be sent and to guarantee your

869
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:13,060
performance and we think after last

870
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:16,690
meetings discussion and the revised

871
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,820
version in this couple of months effort

872
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:22,660
we think this document is in a pretty

873
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:26,080
good status and so we would like to call

874
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:29,830
for a working group adoption for this

875
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:33,720
document thank you that's all from me I

876
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:37,920
have a question for verification so what

877
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,959
makes this so specific in the sense that

878
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,230
we now have the emptyness data plane

879
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,990
that describes engine generic I mean the

880
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,910
data template opinion generic brillo

881
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:51,750
fans control hood and everything and we

882
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:55,330
have a number of solutions for ring

883
00:48:51,750 --> 00:49:02,710
topologies of work is going on currently

884
00:48:55,330 --> 00:49:04,990
as well so I mean is it kind of an

885
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:11,440
informational description on how to

886
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:14,939
combine these into a solution or Wow

887
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,140
Simona stir the this graph only describe

888
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:23,230
specifically how you handle ring

889
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:27,220
topology in our in a in a m+

890
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:30,550
a data plane that that's that's yeah

891
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,770
that that's probably the the answer have

892
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,880
you looked at the other MPLS ring

893
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:38,099
solutions

894
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:45,040
you mean in atlas linger in the ietf yes

895
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:52,119
okay and you don't think they apply you

896
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:57,430
don't think we can build on them well

897
00:49:52,119 --> 00:50:00,400
it's it's the principle are the same but

898
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:02,770
it's it's really a guideline where when

899
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,619
you introduce date and detonate services

900
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:09,700
you basically introduce the replication

901
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:14,109
and elimination and reordering functions

902
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:16,540
which are not you know characteristics

903
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:18,190
of native that's nice so we have two

904
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,900
layers right you have the forty layer

905
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,060
and the service layer and the free off

906
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,619
lives at the service layer have you

907
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,990
looked at taking advantage of the ring

908
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:29,710
the existing MPLS ring solutions at the

909
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:32,859
forwarding layer have have we looked at

910
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:37,510
using the existing ring solutions as

911
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:42,040
solutions at the forwarding layer right

912
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:44,619
that's a good question so you know I

913
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:49,000
know I understand if I read this

914
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:50,829
correctly and it's it I haven't read the

915
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,640
previous version of the draft I haven't

916
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:57,940
read the new one but I think this is are

917
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,890
more for the forwarding layer and then

918
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,319
you need to add the application and

919
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:05,710
elimination and reordering for the

920
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:09,400
service layer so you shouldn't specify

921
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:13,230
anything new for the the forbidding

922
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,230
layer you should use our mrs at this

923
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:20,310
cutie kampala I know nothing about DHCP

924
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:31,210
so you always do uh two questions one is

925
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:34,180
I haven't read the draft but how do you

926
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,170
determine Farquharson anticlockwise is

927
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,990
that something that scan

928
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,640
figured or do you order discover that so

929
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:41,950
how do I decide clockwise or

930
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:44,170
anticlockwise yeah I mean every node has

931
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:46,240
to have the same notion otherwise you'll

932
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,069
have a packet going this way from A to B

933
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,890
and then if we things that clockwise is

934
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:53,589
back to a so there's not how do you get

935
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,690
every node on the ring to have the same

936
00:51:53,589 --> 00:52:00,490
idea of what is clockwise and what is

937
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:04,150
and counter clockwise I'm not quite sure

938
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:06,578
well the Wow I might need to take this

939
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,700
too too too too often discussion but in

940
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:13,599
my point of view you basically set up

941
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:16,660
you set up your SP so you couldn't

942
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:20,859
figure in configuring it beforehand so

943
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:25,000
so one of the advantages of our Mar 2 to

944
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:28,058
it does this you know by advertising

945
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,369
stuff into ice ice or SPF and it

946
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:32,680
determines this automatically versus

947
00:52:30,369 --> 00:52:35,410
needing any configuration the other

948
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,240
thing is in this two ring case you said

949
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:39,910
the upper node and the lower node which

950
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,430
makes sense but you need to do this in

951
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:45,879
terms of you know in this case the upper

952
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:47,890
node is i1 if you're going clockwise and

953
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,890
for if you're going counterclockwise

954
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:53,950
it's I to you need to have this either

955
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:55,990
be algorithmically done or again you're

956
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,308
going to use configuration the whole

957
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:00,308
thing mode rings is if you're going to

958
00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:02,829
have lots of rings making sure you

959
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:05,440
configure all the Rings correctly can be

960
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:08,140
a big problem so the more you can make

961
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,690
the Rings do this either algorithmically

962
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:13,470
or by discovery or something the better

963
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:15,609
you are in terms of making this a

964
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:19,058
scalable solution from a management

965
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:23,140
point of view right oh and one last

966
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:24,970
thing is our cords I mean for example in

967
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,520
some rings you have this thing called an

968
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:29,500
optical bypass so physically you're

969
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,970
still in a ring but you might have a

970
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:36,400
link from say e 2g is that of any

971
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:44,500
interest in that net or is that does not

972
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:45,970
matter or do do not go by us yeah so

973
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,250
I guess it's a question it's a question

974
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:52,810
for the authors yeah the authors are the

975
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:55,780
one to bring it right I can't answer

976
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:59,020
that right now but I'll take it offline

977
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:00,910
and have discussions okay okay I think

978
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,349
the general comment is take a look at

979
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:08,200
our Marv and see if you build on top of

980
00:54:02,349 --> 00:54:14,020
it yeah from a tree

981
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:17,410
the there are many there are many ring

982
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:21,550
protection mechanism for various

983
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:28,899
transport network technologies including

984
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:32,220
MPLS ARIMA on those photos rim

985
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:37,090
protection mechanisms we cannot avoid

986
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:45,129
traffic disruption in case of data

987
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:49,359
failure but with this the net ring then

988
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:53,609
the ring technology here for we can we

989
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:59,859
can I mean in the event of NATO failure

990
00:54:53,609 --> 00:55:03,848
we we can avoid the traffic disruption I

991
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:07,869
mean that we cannot we don't lose any

992
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:12,369
packet so yes that's the advantage of

993
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:14,740
this this document yes that but that

994
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:17,109
feature comes the deafness

995
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:19,450
so the deafness service correction the P

996
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:21,490
of that's the feature that provides you

997
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:25,720
that so it's as it has been pointed out

998
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:28,500
we have two layers forwarding now

999
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:32,680
[Music]

1000
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:35,260
existing technologies and as for the P

1001
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:39,160
of I wanted to also mention that what

1002
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:41,200
you can find is we call it a load or

1003
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:45,220
topology which is comprised of things

1004
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:47,560
and there were in 802 dot on CB what

1005
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,020
example is explained in detail where to

1006
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,700
place application of elimination points

1007
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:54,880
and so on how to leverage that affect

1008
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:58,129
their artifact of topology so it's a

1009
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:02,190
combination of the series informally

1010
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:08,550
right exactly I mean this I mean I heard

1011
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:10,830
a question about how you kind of use a

1012
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:15,690
conventional reading protection

1013
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:18,299
mechanism with is that net technology I

1014
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:21,960
need the net are in protection my answer

1015
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:25,830
is that or when you use this the net

1016
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:30,420
type of protection mechanism you disable

1017
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:36,090
that conventional protection mechanism

1018
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:39,240
in fording plan not for the fourth so

1019
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:47,090
for the right sub layer that's right

1020
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:53,810
okay it is the one and this draft I mean

1021
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:57,360
I know that Turtles the existing the net

1022
00:56:53,810 --> 00:57:01,799
framework and architecture documents

1023
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:03,150
describe that later case including I

1024
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,300
mean this ring

1025
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:11,220
I mean ring with two interconnected nose

1026
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:14,070
can be seen as rather rare type reddit

1027
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:20,250
apollo's network yeah I know that but

1028
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:24,570
here is that the this draft at this

1029
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:28,800
document describes how you apply the net

1030
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:33,900
technology to the ring topology in

1031
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:39,150
details current current architecture and

1032
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:42,450
framework documents description we

1033
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:43,980
thought are not enough yeah I think

1034
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:48,060
you're suggesting that there there's a

1035
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:51,450
room for a pre off Oh Optima sorry and

1036
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:54,420
optimized pre off aware ring protection

1037
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:57,000
scheme and you know that that may be the

1038
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,310
case and I think you need to articulate

1039
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,670
it a little bit better and in particular

1040
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:04,680
if talk about how you want to take

1041
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:07,500
advantage of our mr or why you think you

1042
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,419
can't take advantage of our mr i think

1043
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,800
that's a good discussion to have because

1044
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,360
we've we've worked since we

1045
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,130
it's a technology we've worked on we

1046
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,830
want to make sure that if we can

1047
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,720
leverage it we can't we can and if we

1048
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:22,380
can't and it makes sense to do a pre off

1049
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:25,049
aware ring solution well we can go we

1050
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,310
can spend go to a bit deeper on that one

1051
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:30,440
of the things that of course will come

1052
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:30,440
up is how to skit make that scalable

1053
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:37,140
Christian education what do you mean by

1054
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:42,810
scalable I didn't hear the last word

1055
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:48,170
well what do you mean by scalable where

1056
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:53,790
that your ring protection scheme is

1057
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:56,940
where each each ring you don't have to

1058
00:58:53,790 --> 00:59:00,150
have the same number of pre-op functions

1059
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:02,760
as you have in hand if there's a way to

1060
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:08,760
do that if there's some way to do some

1061
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:10,980
shared protection who do you if your

1062
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,290
only solution if your solution is is

1063
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,940
that at every basically every ring

1064
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:17,070
becomes a segment and you do free off

1065
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,110
within that segment for every flow

1066
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:21,870
that's that's gonna be a very expensive

1067
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:25,230
solution so maybe there's an opportunity

1068
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:27,450
to do something better you know through

1069
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:31,530
aggregation is what we could believe

1070
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:37,859
yeah I cannot get you kitchen right away

1071
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:41,460
but I can I can ask you and about the

1072
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:46,250
first one I mean we certainly can add

1073
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:50,700
the description on how that this can

1074
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:53,400
cooperate with our ml or any

1075
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:56,549
conventional implicature switching

1076
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:04,500
mechanisms because we can certainly do

1077
00:59:56,550 --> 01:00:08,490
them I guess my my community compared my

1078
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:11,190
my comment is the way that they're using

1079
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:14,370
this in the ring since you're

1080
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:16,140
multitasking on both both paths you're

1081
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:18,480
not doing protection really what you're

1082
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,830
saying is if a link fails you still get

1083
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,020
the packet become going the other way

1084
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:24,090
around but armor has two parts to it one

1085
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,660
is the self-configuring of rings and the

1086
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:26,190
others

1087
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,839
action I think you don't need the

1088
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,000
protection part here but you do need the

1089
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:33,288
self-configuring to make it scalable

1090
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,289
from a management point of view

1091
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:41,430
Laura Anderson I got up here because I

1092
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:44,130
thought Lou was a little bit too vague

1093
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:48,029
when he said you take a look at the

1094
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:50,670
forum or well yes that you came back and

1095
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,920
said that they actually have to show

1096
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:55,559
that they can't use on Rory but I think

1097
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,109
that's the case we need to look at or an

1098
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:02,490
hour and see if there is a synergy here

1099
01:00:58,109 --> 01:01:04,799
and if we can use it we should use it in

1100
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:07,129
general we try not I mean I know some

1101
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:11,009
groups don't follow this but in general

1102
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:13,710
we try not to have two solutions for

1103
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:15,240
exactly the same problem so that's all

1104
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:17,970
I'm saying I'm not saying anything more

1105
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:21,959
than let's follow our standard practice

1106
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:27,779
of if there's an existing solution that

1107
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:33,930
is usable let's use it okay jungle you

1108
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:39,319
again about self auto auto configuration

1109
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:43,649
I mean they here the example is 4p2 MP

1110
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:48,299
multicast the services and the the

1111
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:53,730
bridge node over or to know that h22 to

1112
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:59,779
each leaf is aware of that I mean that I

1113
01:01:53,730 --> 01:02:03,720
have I have a subscriber so there that

1114
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:09,809
there can in my understanding that is

1115
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:13,038
done by any any multicast a protocol but

1116
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:19,319
case configuration protocol and then

1117
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:23,250
maybe that once subscriber is attached

1118
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:26,009
EDA and then that can get the

1119
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:30,980
information I mean a signal and then

1120
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:36,320
enable packet replication functionality

1121
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:39,350
there can be done automatically

1122
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,270
well we look forward to seeing the

1123
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:42,470
update based on the discussion I think

1124
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:44,000
we've had some good discussion and some

1125
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:47,299
good interest in this I think it's fair

1126
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,540
that we should have look the the Rai

1127
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:52,820
solution and and and but we also think

1128
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:55,370
that the the value of this draft is

1129
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:58,090
really to give a guideline of how you

1130
01:02:55,370 --> 01:03:00,380
integrate the service layer

1131
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:02,810
consideration of debt not to to the rain

1132
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:03,890
topology as well yeah and and we look

1133
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,900
forward to seeing the update and

1134
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:10,069
wherever you end up based on your your

1135
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:11,570
exploration of the RMR yeah what you can

1136
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:13,640
use what you can use yeah

1137
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:15,800
all right with with that we're actually

1138
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,839
over time we managed to use all our time

1139
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,090
even though we had hoped we'd have some

1140
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:23,450
additional conversation on SR v6 and

1141
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:25,520
bounded latency requirements if you have

1142
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:27,410
comments on those please take them to

1143
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,520
the list and continue the discussion

1144
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:33,980
there and thank you very much and we

1145
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:42,350
will see you online

1146
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:45,190
