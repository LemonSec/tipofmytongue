1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,400
we have a very full agenda so my name is

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,509
Aaron Falk this is the hot RFC

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,020
talk series I'm happy that you all have

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,000
come this is I think the fourth or maybe

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,800
fifth time that we've run this the idea

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,948
of this session is to have a series of

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,010
introductory talks to give folks who are

8
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,960
doing something new in the IETF a way to

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,720
get the word out and so it's especially

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,330
good for things that cross areas or are

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,750
new to the ITF maybe coming in from the

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,970
IRT F or boss that sort of thing to just

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,799
give a very short synopsis with some

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,190
coordinates on how to get involved or

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:54,040
learn more if you're interested we have

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,890
about 22 talks tonight so we've got a

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,540
very full agenda still should come in

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,010
under the two-hour slots so if you've

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,979
made dinner plans I think you'll still

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,899
be able to to make them but the way that

21
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,570
we're going to do that is through very

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,200
strict time limits so we're using the

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,758
larger time management method and so at

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
the end of four minutes if the speaker

25
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,290
hasn't concluded you should hear this

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,289
sound

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
at which point I'd like everybody in the

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,979
room to start clapping and thank our

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,580
speaker very good guys have got the

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,590
right idea

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,190
now all that comes down to my ability to

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,380
push the button correctly let's see on

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,460
the material site you should find all

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,460
the slides that you're going to see

35
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,580
tonight as well as abstracts that

36
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,780
summarize the talks and include the

37
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,610
coordinates for finding out more

38
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,210
information so there's not gonna be any

39
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,890
time for a Q&A the it's really intended

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,330
to be something that's very concise give

41
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,920
you the flavor or something new move on

42
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,070
to the next thing I hope you find it

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,600
interesting and so Brian if you would

44
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,048
come up our first speaker and I'll get

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,048
your slides up

46
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,620
[Music]

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,250
okay wait Oh yo we only have you pressed

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,250
your button yet

49
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,230
okay so the on the left you see some

50
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,270
users on the right you see some services

51
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,179
on the objective of what we're talking

52
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,709
about here is to discuss a new way of

53
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,620
possibly connecting the users to

54
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,620
services I click - nothing happened

55
00:02:51,010 --> 00:03:02,120
thank you what anyway why end-to-end IP

56
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,880
service is no longer a safe assumption

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,390
in the Internet they will usually be

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,109
middleboxes users want specific services

59
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:14,238
they don't want IP addresses or URLs and

60
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,580
I Spees want to provide some services

61
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:26,720
and they want to redirect the user to

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:29,810
other services that was the wrong one so

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,849
what use the service type requested on

64
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,010
IP address to forward packets at the

65
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,470
network edge we're not talking about the

66
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,720
core of the network abstract a service

67
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,060
as something called a service action

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,540
type which is a small integer indicating

69
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,390
the service is a very generic idea near

70
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,670
the user the packets are routed by the

71
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,369
service action type and not by the

72
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,309
address and of course before you to ask

73
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,170
the obvious question IP reach ability is

74
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,480
one of the available services which is

75
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,530
how it turns out to work backwards so

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,200
here are something examples of service

77
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,019
action types reach ability on ipv6 reach

78
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,119
ability on ipv4 discovery service

79
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,560
computation service a storage service

80
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,820
and there's a list of others in the

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:20,209
draft packets are in a format derived

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,460
from ipv6 this is a low-level protocol

83
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,229
but there's a service action type

84
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,000
instead of a destination address because

85
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,919
users don't care about destination

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
addresses and there are other goodies

87
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,969
that look like a lair violation because

88
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,119
actually this thing is intentionally a

89
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,490
lair violation there's some toy code is

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,050
probably not worth looking at more

91
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,140
important there is a site meeting

92
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,500
discussion on Wednesday morning 8:30 not

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,750
in the church but in the room called

94
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,700
we're also discussing other draft that

95
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:58,450
I'm going to talk about in the second

96
00:04:48,700 --> 00:05:00,969
four minutes and I'm done hello it's me

97
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:05,310
again with the same with the same

98
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:09,970
co-authors this is a bit more

99
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,150
down-to-earth why are we talking about

100
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,910
this in edge deployments of IOT in

101
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,020
particular the physical MTU and the

102
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,020
bitrate Oh

103
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:24,070
in some cases extremely low that's well

104
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,320
known so packet size matters a lot he

105
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,500
edge routers the edge routers may be

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,810
constrained themselves that has other

107
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,770
implications besides the problem of

108
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,570
bandwidth and bitrate header

109
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:42,250
decompression and header compression

110
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:45,430
header decompression use resources 128

111
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,260
bit addresses use memory so for a

112
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,310
certain class advertised there is a

113
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:54,849
strong case for both reducing packet

114
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,680
size and reducing the header

115
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,590
decompression and compression overhead

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,260
what why are you doing by using shorter

117
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,869
addresses routing on the shorter

118
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:08,409
addresses not transmitting unnecessary

119
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,290
bytes and avoiding any fancy compression

120
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:17,230
decompression algorithms at the level of

121
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:19,450
processing the IP header how you define

122
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,580
an address length in within a domain all

123
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,520
addresses within the domain are assumed

124
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,130
to have a prefix in front of that of 128

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,080
minus n bits and there's lots of bit

126
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,930
bytes and headers that you can get rid

127
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:37,840
of if you think about it and we use a

128
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:39,610
flexible header encoding octet to tell

129
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,799
the lowest layer of software how the

130
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,020
header has been encoded so you might end

131
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,570
up with a complete ipv6 header that

132
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,880
consists of a low length NextEra hop

133
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,800
limit and a truncated destination

134
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,680
address because it turns out in the

135
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,900
right conditions all the other bits and

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,600
pieces in the header intact

137
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,359
any use and those are the bits that you

138
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,170
expect the this constrained router to

139
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,840
look at where six low working group on

140
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:10,920
tomorrow and same side meeting

141
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:20,250
discussion in not Adam on Wednesday the

142
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:22,500
end before we go to our next speaker I

143
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,170
just want to let folks know that this

144
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,230
session is being streamed live and

145
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,720
there's going to be a video available on

146
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,430
YouTube so if you want to point somebody

147
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,480
to this there'll be YouTube coordinates

148
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,480
and usual file

149
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,750
okay hello everyone today I'm

150
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:58,200
introducing a new technology called

151
00:07:50,750 --> 00:08:02,460
instant congestion assessment Network so

152
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:05,210
what's a main target problem first the

153
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,000
traffic in real networks especially

154
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:12,510
metro network is always heavily

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,290
unbalanced although we have ecmp or you

156
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:18,020
can build such kind of technologies

157
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:21,720
surely they don't really work very well

158
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:27,299
and second the traffic is always

159
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:30,750
changing so fast and traditional traffic

160
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:35,940
engineering technology cannot adapt the

161
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:39,960
traffic in real-time so with the ICANN

162
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,650
technology we can provide guaranteed

163
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,920
networ load balance in real-time

164
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:50,720
millisecond level and as well as SLE

165
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:54,060
assurance and high availability these

166
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,280
actually share the same core technology

167
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:01,800
but with different purposes and for the

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:06,449
use case one the network loop balance we

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,870
have already implement a prototype based

170
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:15,240
on commercial hardware router and

171
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:18,420
according to our test in laboratory the

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:23,820
whole network throughput could be

173
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:28,709
increased up to 30 percentage which is a

174
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:31,170
ridiculous resort and the basic

175
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:35,430
principle of the IEEE content knowledge

176
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:38,280
that we used the I think controller to

177
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,250
calculate multiple paths between each

178
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:46,610
pair of ingress and egress router and

179
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:49,590
after that the rotors will by themselves

180
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,800
adjust the flows between the multiple

181
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,510
paths based on the continuous

182
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,790
measurement of the

183
00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:01,750
Pass congestion seach situation this is

184
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:08,480
done in a very fast manner in

185
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:10,700
millisecond level so welcome to join the

186
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:16,180
discussion with more details in tears

187
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:18,890
and RTG GG and you can also check the

188
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,579
backup slides of this presentation and

189
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:25,430
please feel free to contact with me with

190
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:32,640
any questions thanks

[Applause]

192
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:49,720
hi so Adam and Bob and I are working

193
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:51,220
with various international standard

194
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,720
setting bodies and government agencies

195
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,779
on a really critical problem go next

196
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,550
slide yeah so it's just this a small

197
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,980
unmanned air vehicle can very rapidly

198
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,050
get close to a crowd or a piece of

199
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,779
critical infrastructure without being

200
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,060
observed on route and some public safety

201
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,860
person armed with only something that

202
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,689
he's likely to be carrying needs to be

203
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,640
able to quickly identify that thing is

204
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,430
it a friend is it a fall can we look up

205
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,470
its flight plan maybe can we establish

206
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,420
communications with its operator and

207
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,680
know for sure that it's the operator of

208
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,500
that aircraft that we're talking with

209
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,920
this problem of mapping a physical

210
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,709
location to a trustworthy identity

211
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,319
seemed to me related to the identifier

212
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,029
locator split in the internet and where

213
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,450
we're trying to go between a logical

214
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:42,250
location and an identity and so we're

215
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,740
looking at the use of hip to do this and

216
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:50,140
I'm gonna let a hip expert take the rest

217
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:52,930
of the time speaking with Stu and Adam

218
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,959
we've worked out value of hits as the

219
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,000
remote ID for UAE's it provides a

220
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,670
trustworthy identity to pair with

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,190
physical logical location data as you

222
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,779
know hits our value ipv6 addresses can

223
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,640
be used directly over the broadcast of

224
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,589
broadcast media if that's what you're

225
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,980
transmitting like Bluetooth Bluetooth

226
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,920
the five is one of the buys for this

227
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,140
with prove ownership using the high for

228
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,000
the signature full mobility and

229
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,459
multihoming so in case you're using

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,459
multiple files on this particular UA

231
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:26,739
we're supported you can use the hip face

232
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:29,709
IPSec for secure communication if that's

233
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,199
what you desire need and we can come up

234
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,209
to a secure registration of the full

235
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,390
identity bootstrap on a first come first

236
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:41,649
owned for the ID that's what's available

237
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,360
there but it's not exactly what's needed

238
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,880
for this case there's some work needs to

239
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,430
be done the original design of hip

240
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,069
talked about hierarchical hips I've done

241
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,130
a draft on this since then and because

242
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:55,479
of ownership and other registry issues

243
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,970
hierarchal hits would definitely be a

244
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,980
value for this we need to have an

245
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,560
expanded registration process of what's

246
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,570
in the current documents in terms of a

247
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,640
federated registrated registration

248
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,170
authorities to tie in the various

249
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,330
metadata the actual physical location

250
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,150
and ownership and other information

251
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:16,900
about the device some of the new crypto

252
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:19,090
support which is out there taking

253
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,750
advantage of seaboard where we're

254
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:26,170
appropriate and since they keep on in

255
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,570
the work talking oh look at hip as a

256
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,490
whole Olaf method that's we've seen so

257
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,820
far there would be other work to be

258
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,280
determined as we go through this process

259
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,040
but we feel that this is a very good fit

260
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:45,280
of technology and a requirement

261
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,199
situation and we have a sign meeting

262
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,949
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon during

263
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,580
the PM 3 timeslot and it's in room C 2

264
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,810
for our side meeting and there's a

265
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,080
mailing list that's right thing ends

266
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,880
main list TM - our ID at IETF Court

267
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:07,600
which is just set up today

268
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:09,160
[Applause]

269
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,870
for the folks in the back there are a

270
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,430
few seats in the front and a few seats

271
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,660
over against the wall over there if you

272
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,660
are trying to get in and

273
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,070
hello Sharon from NexStar

274
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:35,360
Sharon from the X I want to talk to you

275
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:39,290
about a cool problem and RFC draft that

276
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:44,030
solves it it has to do with the sharing

277
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:47,540
of physical information of a on the road

278
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:49,760
between cars and it makes use of a grid

279
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:54,199
of the earth actually gonna go rid of

280
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:57,020
the earth called h3 and an overlay

281
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,980
network which can make those tiles of

282
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:04,130
the earth addressable called Lisp so

283
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,080
just as a background on the problem we

284
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,810
distribute hundreds or thousands of

285
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,700
cameras each week to drivers for them to

286
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,969
drive around they are paired with their

287
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:18,530
phones they do it because of insurance

288
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:21,530
in motivations and the insurers want

289
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:25,250
them to do that but as a result we

290
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:28,670
actually have tens of thousands of eyes

291
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:33,220
crawling the physical space and the

292
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:35,569
public domain in every major US city and

293
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,430
because of the pairing to the phone it's

294
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,440
not just cameras they actually

295
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,609
understand what they see with the eye

296
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,910
and they are connected using a network

297
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:50,960
so when we want all these mobility

298
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,689
client agents roaming the streets to

299
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,540
communicate what they see the connected

300
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:59,110
car industry had two options for us one

301
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,510
is the offline network tell us about

302
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:06,500
like a stop sign that fell or started by

303
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:08,689
a tree or construction zone which is in

304
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,610
permeate our of permit but it doesn't

305
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,700
tell you if that construction cone is

306
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,920
generating problems right now or if that

307
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,370
traffic sign is okay but the traffic

308
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,760
light is out right now so there is a

309
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,310
real-time Network option mostly for

310
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,930
safety and but that's a peer-to-peer

311
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:32,119
network so for example to safety

312
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,859
situations not for something that I'm

313
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,100
about to hit right now but something

314
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,080
which let's say I am

315
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,320
driving 100 kilometres an hour to a

316
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,220
pileup or to a slowdown I'm turning a

317
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,710
corner in a junction in a city to a

318
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,100
double parked vehicle an hour unloading

319
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:52,530
vehicle a tough situation for me to

320
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,870
negotiate out of and the cross traffic

321
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,600
sees it clearly there is no clear way

322
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,370
for me to get that information if the

323
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,900
car that the last car just drove away

324
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,090
three seconds ago and one get the

325
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,980
information or may get multiple and

326
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:09,060
conflicting informations from cars I

327
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:12,720
don't know and I don't want to know so

328
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:16,230
the solution is to pack up all these

329
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,640
annotations as you drive in and assign

330
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,980
it to a tile that tile has a ID based on

331
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,360
the location in the earth but also its

332
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,060
transit to an eID

333
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:31,459
which is a lisp address which is now

334
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,460
make it something I can send packets to

335
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:39,270
this addressing scheme allows me to

336
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,210
share information between let's say

337
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,120
mobility car going here mobility car

338
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,450
going there these cars is this guy cars

339
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,969
future and vice versa they can publish

340
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,610
and subscribe to it in tests we were

341
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,580
able to communicate a red light bridge

342
00:17:53,610 --> 00:18:00,600
in other four milliseconds a bit of a

343
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,939
lab conditions between a camera on the

344
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,370
junctions and all the cars approaching

345
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,470
and affected by it so if you're

346
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,699
interested it's discussed in the list

347
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:14,600
working group tomorrow and happy to have

348
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,600
more participants

349
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,399
[Applause]

350
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,629
hi I'm Ronnie Evan and on this car I'll

351
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:38,840
present the open congestion control

352
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:44,210
architecture with network operation for

353
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:48,110
our DMA fabric the motivation for this

354
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:50,480
work is for data center that the high

355
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,370
link speeds that are making network

356
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,919
transfer complete faster in fewer out

357
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,750
--'tis short data burst require low

358
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,760
latency while longer data transfer

359
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,090
requires high throughput so these are

360
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,010
two requirement there the RTA is the

361
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,649
common protocol in data center network

362
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,990
however the congestion control is not

363
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:14,090
optimized for different usage and lack

364
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:16,190
of interoperability allowing for

365
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,500
flexibility in running an optimized

366
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,720
congestion method in the network

367
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,429
interface card in having fast congestion

368
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,799
notification to the sender can improve

369
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,169
the our DMA they have a trench transfer

370
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,179
it's common in the deficit and network

371
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:32,480
the TCP traffic is mixed with the our

372
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:35,900
DMA traffic and the causes conflicts

373
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,130
between priorities between them and what

374
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,870
we're saying is there a better method

375
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,059
that could solve the problems mentioned

376
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,129
above while addressing interoperability

377
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,950
so that our DMA traffic can be treated

378
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,660
more efficiently so we have two

379
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,360
documents on the open control

380
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,090
architectures the requirement document

381
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,830
and the architectural document the

382
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,629
requirement discussed the problems of

383
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,580
the currently mode direct memory access

384
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,530
fabric congestion and link technology

385
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,290
and the requirement for better

386
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,149
performance and the architecture

387
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:07,850
proposed an open control architecture of

388
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,799
host networks for the high-performance

389
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,879
our DMA fabric to provide better

390
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:18,049
congestion and the link for HPC and

391
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,179
distributed storage application the

392
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:25,250
architecture itself is seen in this

393
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:27,440
slide there are there's the center the

394
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,480
reaction point and then the receiver is

395
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,160
the notification point but the switch

396
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,730
can serve bosses the congestion point

397
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,440
that also

398
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,760
the congestion point but also can

399
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,970
provide identification

400
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:42,290
so there's can be a net only control

401
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:44,150
channel and of course they Nick - Nick

402
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,280
control channel that will provide the

403
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,130
information to allow the sender to

404
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,910
respond better and faster so the design

405
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,860
configuration is provide better

406
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,040
information about the congestion stay

407
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:01,159
stay to the sender faster and more

408
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,170
accurate from the network and notify the

409
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:07,520
sender the reaction point from their

410
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:09,650
network support it can support proactive

411
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,320
response from the notification point and

412
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,480
support our DMA transport different our

413
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,280
deviate transport so this what we are

414
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,120
talking about is something that would be

415
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,720
transport agnostic and support multiplex

416
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,479
the traffic of our DMA and TCP we did

417
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,020
some already some experimental tests and

418
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,290
we are having a side meeting on tomorrow

419
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,770
in Auto damn room and of course if you

420
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:39,000
want to discuss it with me this is my

421
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:45,210
coordinates thank you

422
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,210
[Applause]

423
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,549
hi I'm Paul Congdon and if we had

424
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,440
coordinated better I probably would have

425
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,960
gone just before Ronnie because this is

426
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,429
very similar topic but I'm kind of

427
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,350
approaching it from a little bit of a

428
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:07,029
more higher level not a specific

429
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,969
solution Ronnie has some some drafts

430
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:11,649
that that describe that solution someone

431
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,450
talked about strat strategies to

432
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:15,820
dramatically improve congestion control

433
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,590
and high performance data centers so

434
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,450
first of all data center congestion is

435
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,189
different than the internet congestion I

436
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,799
think we all know that's a few handful

437
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,299
of transactions can cause a lot coming

438
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:27,580
in from the web can cause a lot of

439
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:29,320
activity inside a data center so data

440
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,960
centers have much different environment

441
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,490
there's different bandwidth delay the

442
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,360
switches are implemented different and

443
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,460
small buffers high speed links you know

444
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,039
then different Internet routers there's

445
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,159
a lot more homogeneity in the network

446
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:47,830
design it's not so random the traffic is

447
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,379
very concentrated servers and storage

448
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,149
are all in close proximity and there's a

449
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:53,408
lot of different the traffic profiles

450
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:56,469
are kind of well-known highly

451
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:58,210
coordinated correlated and typically

452
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,159
they're managed with a lot fewer people

453
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,049
under a single management domain so all

454
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,820
this means that these data center

455
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,289
congesting the environment in which it

456
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,700
runs is much different than the internet

457
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:08,919
and we know we do internet standards

458
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,440
here but but we also do have focused on

459
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,990
data center standards DC TCP as an

460
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,720
example so the data center needs low

461
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,220
latency low overhead high efficiency and

462
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,409
high throughput so one thing the data

463
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,909
center kind of has in common with the

464
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,519
Internet is there's this trend to do

465
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:26,470
more over UDP something like we've seen

466
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,539
a lot of activity with quic for example

467
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,269
so what if we you know could do

468
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:34,929
something that that was more sort of

469
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:38,019
quick like but not quick you know as

470
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:39,340
heavy perhaps for specific for the data

471
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,669
center and maybe we did something that

472
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:45,309
was Datagram congestion control like but

473
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:47,019
again focused on the congestion problems

474
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,139
of the Internet of the data center it

475
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:51,789
would need to be Hardware off loadable

476
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:54,008
but maybe with less emphasis on security

477
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,879
and crypto and all the threading kind of

478
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,580
stuff that

479
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,760
have it would need to be really common

480
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,889
congestion control as described in the

481
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,530
previous talk and ideally would need to

482
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,690
have the network visibility marking and

483
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,660
signaling abilities from the network

484
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,100
itself so the ITF has this expertise so

485
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,870
let's leverage and not leave it to the

486
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,090
UDP application riders let's see if we

487
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,760
can do something we know datacenter

488
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,679
congestion is different the authors of

489
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,240
these papers have done a lot of work on

490
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,400
congestion trees so there's kind of two

491
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,870
types you know in network and in

492
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,360
congestion and it's constantly moving

493
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:31,709
moving around in cast or in network

494
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,929
we've got solutions today such as ecmp

495
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:37,570
ecn even even in a lossless environment

496
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:40,050
ecn with priority flow control all of

497
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:42,460
these have various pros and cons but

498
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:45,690
they're not completely addressing the

499
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,120
needs that we see so some ideas of

500
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:52,420
augmenting ecn with with a data center

501
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,280
focus for a UDP layer you know providing

502
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,260
more feedback from the switches in the

503
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,050
packet headers perhaps you know marking

504
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,360
delay inside packets so that we can get

505
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,760
really fine grain view of what's going

506
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,469
on being able to figure out is this

507
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,960
congestion we're experiencing right now

508
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,040
is it in network or is it in cast you

509
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,890
know because maybe we would take

510
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,990
different approaches being able to speed

511
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,760
up notifications to the source so they

512
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,610
can quench you know in a way that

513
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,410
addresses it and then implementing fast

514
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,689
mechanisms in the switch to respond

515
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,580
immediately so so what like to do is

516
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,730
discuss the technical approach and

517
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,409
feasibility of these ideas in a side

518
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,000
meeting so we have a side meeting

519
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,590
tomorrow Notre Dame it's the same one

520
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,260
that was announced and we're also

521
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,389
providing remote participation for that

522
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,330
and then we're going to be requesting a

523
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,220
ETF mailing list as well so I think I

524
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,020
made it we also have a whole bunch of

525
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,290
references in this deck if you want to

526
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,290
read them

527
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,509
thank you for the folks in the back

528
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,488
there's room on the floor in the front

529
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,669
if you guys want to sit down so just

530
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:56,669
saying

531
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,540
Thanks hi I will represent a walk

532
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,530
showing that we can leverage an existing

533
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,320
network intelligence to build service

534
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,420
from Zhang Sheng in most of existing

535
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,220
deployment service functions even trains

536
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,160
are controlled by a central control

537
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,430
point which computable ideal placement

538
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,470
of virtual functions such as IDs for

539
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:36,380
your world and the flow path that goes

540
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,360
for them raising some program since it

541
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,250
creates failure and the network's

542
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,439
scalability issues it's oddly

543
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,220
interoperable with existing networks and

544
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,820
it under exploit existing protocols or

545
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,770
negative a network for instance service

546
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,439
function training program is mainly a

547
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,000
routing program because you have to

548
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,230
route traffic for a set of white one

549
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,210
between two before which in the

550
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,330
destination so what your purpose is to

551
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,850
augment classical entire entire gate for

552
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,070
protocol and make them a function aware

553
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:10,510
you know in order to build service

554
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:13,040
function path I will quickly remind how

555
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:15,290
integral from functions you have a

556
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,090
gateway which are connecting networks

557
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:21,379
sharing information and building a

558
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,360
network view and based on what it it

559
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,990
will compute

560
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:29,570
routing tables what who proposes to bind

561
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:35,680
some prefix to a specific function such

562
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:38,649
as first file an IDs allowing to use of

563
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:44,450
routing protocol to function through

564
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:51,290
total flow through functions and to use

565
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:52,580
any casings to to use the IGP matrix to

566
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:58,310
select the functions and other

567
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:59,929
consequence you have a logical network

568
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,500
view which is which one where you have a

569
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:06,950
for instance pink nodes which represent

570
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:12,020
a for instance a firewall and in the two

571
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:14,760
instance on the shooters will be

572
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:17,700
we'll be fun based of some matrix where

573
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,460
I sit for two to be instance if you're

574
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,920
interested in a walk where we are doing

575
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,380
you can come to a contentious session on

576
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:29,040
Thursday and we can discuss about that

577
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:33,330
and you can also find the sum of all we

578
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:49,050
have presented in existing conferences

579
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:51,840
different Thank You Jeffrey from

580
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:54,450
highways so the purpose of this talk is

581
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,659
to find the people she had the same

582
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:01,140
interests as with me too about the

583
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:04,200
theory behind the networking so to kind

584
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,929
of clarify the terminology theory as a

585
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:12,000
system of ideas to explain based on

586
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:14,280
general principles so ITF is quite a

587
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,340
unique we have many contribution from

588
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,010
universities and we even have a research

589
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,520
arm i at EF but in my personal views

590
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:26,190
there's still an gap in our networking

591
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,030
area as a whole so our innovation and

592
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:32,309
the design highly rely on experience I

593
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:35,460
don't find a well-defined body of

594
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:39,139
knowledge or a set of approaches that

595
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:42,150
can help us to make design choice and

596
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:45,450
understand the trade-off behind those

597
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,950
decisions so I'm not the only one have

598
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,830
this feeling so these are very

599
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:54,390
interesting paper from Jennifer works

600
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:57,480
for the Princeton Princeton University

601
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,290
here she coated some doubts from people

602
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,170
inside and outside networking community

603
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:08,490
so is networking a set of protocol

604
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:10,830
acronyms or a heap of head formats or we

605
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,290
are just a big a bunch of boxes of

606
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:17,159
course Jennifer defeated as though all

607
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:21,300
these questions elegantly but at the end

608
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,220
of the paper she also suggested that we

609
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,418
can make the question we ask more

610
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,499
precise and

611
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:31,259
the way we answer them more Legolas and

612
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:33,779
the week maybe we can not so much value

613
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:37,169
new problems over deep answers to

614
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:39,119
existing questions we need to encourage

615
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,369
a more thorough and complete and the

616
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:45,418
deeper research

617
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:48,449
so why IDF so in one way this theory can

618
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:52,080
help IDF to explain and predict the

619
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:56,309
outcomes from new design and facing your

620
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,850
problems and also it can help us for

621
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:03,600
clinical help new generation to inherit

622
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:07,049
and make their own contributions so on

623
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,619
the other way when IDF who can can help

624
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:13,350
so we have both rich and very successful

625
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:16,918
experience and expertise in theory we

626
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:19,469
have so many academic participants so

627
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:23,309
why now now we are facing some new

628
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:26,070
requirements such as deterministic and

629
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:29,639
bounded delay services so we may require

630
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:33,559
more theoretical analysis than before so

631
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:36,928
this is the other example in Ige's the

632
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:40,200
proposed to apply a network calculus a

633
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:45,359
kind of queueing theory to the time

634
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:47,629
sensitive networking problem so there

635
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:52,739
are several useful reference of course

636
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:55,738
this in one way is in warranty as the

637
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:58,470
mathematical foundations and to us and

638
00:31:55,739 --> 00:32:01,409
on the other yes the theory of the zan

639
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:04,200
hope the semen proposed a framework long

640
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:05,669
time ago I don't think I have time to

641
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,749
adjust the details but if you are

642
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:13,100
interested contact us me and my friend

643
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:20,550
can Leon from China Mobile thank you

644
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,550
[Applause]

645
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,860
okay this is about software management

646
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,929
if you don't use these standards which

647
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,870
is really the entire software industry

648
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:45,280
outside networking so you you you know

649
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,379
every every company starts the same way

650
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,940
you write a little service you start

651
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,610
including more services to do your

652
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,950
function and then you learn about micro

653
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:56,379
services it becomes this and of course

654
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,750
you get this and of course you need a

655
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,180
management plan to to make sense of this

656
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:05,080
all so for each one of those little

657
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,540
boxes this is what you have to do today

658
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,850
you have to scrape log files to find out

659
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,889
if the Services is acting incorrectly

660
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,840
you have to write some tool to generate

661
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:17,200
config files deliver it bounce the

662
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,520
service okay sorry thanks if it has a

663
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,930
REST API you have to integrate with that

664
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,780
you find performance metrics any which

665
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,070
way you can and if it has a security

666
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,410
model you got to somehow integrate with

667
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:33,070
that so every single service you have to

668
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,510
do this with and if it looks like a lot

669
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,399
of work it is a lot of work but a lot of

670
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,020
companies are cheating because they're

671
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,060
finding recipes on the Internet to help

672
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,010
them get a jump start or they're only

673
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,659
mapping the pieces that they they think

674
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,430
they need before they go into deployment

675
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,080
and this is a problem because they find

676
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,630
out after deployment they forgot

677
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,689
something so clearly this is a lot of

678
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:55,840
work and the standards for yang Andres

679
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,120
conf solve this entirely with the

680
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,270
industry as a whole and to give you an

681
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,340
idea the scope of this problem puppet

682
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,379
labs they estimate there are now more

683
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,510
people in the management plane than

684
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,040
there are in the data plane so more

685
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,199
people writing software about software

686
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,379
than the software itself solving

687
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:18,129
problems so this is a very large problem

688
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:20,649
and so in 2015 I became aware of these

689
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:23,168
standards and wrote a implementation of

690
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:26,290
the the yang and the rest comp specs in

691
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:29,770
go I started there so I wrote a little

692
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,540
my first project was this bartender and

693
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,179
it has a Raspberry Pi and some relays

694
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:39,250
and some pumps and it's got a little

695
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:40,659
interface to make oh that so but I

696
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,550
didn't flip it at all in rest comp so

697
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,919
there's a yang model for the bartender

698
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:47,490
and you can assign a pump to a

699
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,690
particular liquid and

700
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:51,189
even when you make your recipe you're

701
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,010
going through ress Kampf

702
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,240
and it was really no special tools on

703
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,550
the JavaScript to get this to work

704
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,410
rest comp really is designed really well

705
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,280
to make it palatable to the industry as

706
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,319
a whole which is what his design was so

707
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,290
any I really like how rest comp has

708
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,560
different modules so if you know amazon

709
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:13,119
published a yang for alexa skill i could

710
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,270
add that in and all of a sudden you're

711
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,430
saying Alexa said make me a mai tai so

712
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,190
since then I've used this in lots of

713
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,230
different industries IOT schools malware

714
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:26,619
detection the standards work really

715
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:29,440
really well but of course that's only so

716
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:31,510
good so when we've arrived is when I can

717
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,119
tell say pager duty which is a system

718
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,130
for alerting you to say hey post grads

719
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:38,109
when there's a slow query paged me about

720
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,640
it and I didn't have to involve DevOps I

721
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:41,680
didn't have to program anything and this

722
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,569
is all possible with the standards but

723
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,589
none of these tools know about these

724
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:49,990
standards or implementing those so I'm

725
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:52,630
really here to talk about this this

726
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,609
problem in industry as a whole see if

727
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,250
this problem resonates with anybody

728
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:58,779
I realized ITF is concerned about

729
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,390
networking but there's definitely a

730
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,100
bigger hole and I estimate this is there

731
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:06,430
are actually 10 million developers this

732
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,049
this could actually help them out so and

733
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,390
I'm one of those because without these

734
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:13,290
standards I find using these standards

735
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,400
in outside networking it really doesn't

736
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,400
doesn't really solve the bigger problems

737
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,010
so like I said if this is resonates with

738
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,910
you reach out to me there's no working

739
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:28,650
groups on this but maybe next ITF there

740
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,649
could that's it

741
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:44,229
if the ITF is about anything it's about

742
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:46,180
making bringing my ties into schools hi

743
00:36:44,229 --> 00:36:48,038
everyone I'm here to talk about like

744
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,989
aetherium improvement proposals and

745
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:53,289
there's no time for introductions we

746
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:54,849
just in jumping so as you may know or

747
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:56,859
may not a theorem is the second largest

748
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,749
cryptocurrency just based on the market

749
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:00,489
cap there is a possibly the number of

750
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:03,038
developers and tools that are based on

751
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:06,339
that alright the first and hold

752
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,109
blockchain DLTS theorem is a home for

753
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:10,269
ENS which is a theorem naming service

754
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:13,140
which they're trying to do that eat ETL

755
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:16,508
D and also do DNS SEC in the blockchain

756
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,769
also for EFS or D central file system

757
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:20,380
applications there are a lot of more

758
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,479
apps there so I'm mostly argument

759
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,099
looking processes here so etherium is

760
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:25,959
one of the healthiest essential dev

761
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:28,539
cycles ethan amongst the blockchain and

762
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:31,839
cryptocurrency projects or is it far

763
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:33,459
from the perfect perfect some of the

764
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,529
historical and challenges like the

765
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:38,078
central decentralization requires a

766
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:40,150
non-hierarchical development cycle and

767
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,829
it's really hard so they have this e IP

768
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,410
which is in a theorem improvement

769
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:46,420
proposals which was inspired by Bitcoin

770
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,670
improver proposals and that was inspired

771
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,009
by pet Python enhancement proposals

772
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,199
which that also in was enjoyed by IETF

773
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:54,549
request for comment and there are some

774
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,440
aspects of it dropped on this path we

775
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:58,209
don't know where exactly but a security

776
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,519
consideration section on the IP it's not

777
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:02,140
there I'm really trying to put add it

778
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:05,049
back and it's gonna be added in the next

779
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,400
month probably so there is some other

780
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:09,130
process this is like the process today

781
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,499
I'm gonna go quickly on on these and the

782
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,390
slides are there for more details so

783
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:15,249
after discussing in the forum's and

784
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,348
getting the community supports the EIP

785
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:18,729
author would add the CIP there so

786
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,309
security concession is missing there

787
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:23,259
we're trying to add it there and then

788
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:25,779
goes to a selected track so the track

789
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,910
the core track is actually the consensus

790
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:29,859
protocol and the protocol it's a really

791
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,529
critical one it has resulted in forks in

792
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:34,119
the network and a lot of controversy

793
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:36,339
there are some others that look ERC if

794
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,209
you have heard of tokens security tokens

795
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:41,650
you are c20 they're all in this track

796
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:43,808
and there are some other things so the

797
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,220
process itself has like four you could

798
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:49,720
say five steps

799
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:51,868
so when it gets a community support it

800
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,879
gets the work in progress draft and

801
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:57,339
basically they write these usually major

802
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,560
major and if it's a career Pete needs

803
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:02,440
implementation the basic talk about it

804
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,440
talks about the proof-of-concept after

805
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,280
that it has in the EIP number and goes

806
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,800
to a draft mode here the European

807
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,200
and further make sure the draft to have

808
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,319
in a way that actually makes sense and

809
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,730
it has some more support and after that

810
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:20,740
it goes to the last call this process

811
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,810
every iteration takes more than around

812
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,810
two weeks and it's actually the ends up

813
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:28,270
with a call like a conference call so

814
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:30,400
here mainly they talk about if there are

815
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,079
there any security implementations and

816
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,349
that needed to be checked here mainly on

817
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,170
test tests and it's more on a non

818
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:40,000
official one and after that if it's a

819
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,560
quarry IP gets accepted and all the

820
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,510
clients at least three of the clients

821
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,730
there are like four or five ATM clients

822
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,800
need to implement that to get that

823
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,050
actually in a final state if it's not

824
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,970
cool then it sometimes is standard it

825
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,160
just goes to the public to find out

826
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,959
state so this is overall what I just

827
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,910
talked about and this is the first

828
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,560
attempt as far as we know to visualize

829
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,810
this and have something to show that

830
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,490
this is the process usually and still

831
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:07,390
even with this process it happens on

832
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:09,098
github proposals people request

833
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,420
everything happens there there's this

834
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:14,520
forum if they're your magicians that

835
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:17,020
people discuss there and magicians there

836
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,700
for the optimization and also this is

837
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,550
the call this is like a chord F called

838
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:24,189
actually the decisions happen there so

839
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:28,240
why am I talking about this so I've been

840
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:30,819
involved in also our IT process we need

841
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,098
that our ITF people to find the gaps and

842
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:35,410
missing pieces in this and in this

843
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:38,290
process and if I modules I'm open to any

844
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,720
discussions and comments and this is how

845
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:44,460
you can reach me and I would be happy to

846
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,459
talk about anything about watching

847
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:50,959
[Applause]

848
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,560
[Applause]

849
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,690
hello everyone my name is chingu I'm

850
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,420
from Poway I'm here to discuss what's

851
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,730
the next step of young unite have

852
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:15,000
actually a little bit of background for

853
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:18,510
me I used to chair area same area same

854
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,460
in Holmes area who deliver young be the

855
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:25,859
model for era VPN and actually witnessed

856
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,829
the young take off and followership but

857
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:31,190
we still feel there's some problem so

858
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:34,260
that's why I bring this topic here and

859
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:39,210
so young data model get a lot of

860
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:44,119
traction actually operator began to plan

861
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:47,250
to deploy a young beta model and but the

862
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:50,819
the reason for that actually young

863
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:53,310
actually not only happy to automate as a

864
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:57,300
networker but also allow operator to

865
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:59,790
build the more agile service young

866
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,450
actually can model the service from the

867
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:05,160
top and also allow you to model the

868
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:08,460
collaboration of raising of the device

869
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,200
allow you to configure the product on

870
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,020
the device get a net was set hopper so

871
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,450
usually the young beta model you will

872
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,839
classify them into service layer model

873
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,759
and device level model but also in the

874
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:23,040
between we have resource level model

875
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,260
they allow you to schedule results to

876
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:31,560
meet the service requirements from the

877
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:33,810
top and also allow you to do to program

878
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:38,430
the networker actually make adapt to

879
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:42,990
network change and so right now in idea

880
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:48,240
more than 260 young a model actually has

881
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:52,259
been developed in idea and more than 50

882
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,859
obviously and including 80 young teen

883
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,210
model and we also see actually more than

884
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,890
100 young

885
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,560
working with each other that be

886
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:05,759
proceeded in night here so which have so

887
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:08,190
many young Bella model and but the the

888
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,920
problem actually is you know we can

889
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,950
reference the intact bender in the

890
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,700
operated test report we can see actually

891
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:20,390
that como has widely adopted it but for

892
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,069
young the model still an early in

893
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:29,549
adoption stages so what's the reason

894
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:31,740
behind so we see actually because the

895
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:34,220
many operate actually you know not

896
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,080
engaging ideal for this young data model

897
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,850
development actually for some operator

898
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,549
who already deployed these can

899
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:44,009
technology may not aware I developed

900
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:47,610
this young Tatum model even for the

901
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:50,160
operator who actually know what I do to

902
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:53,490
him but they don't know how how this

903
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:57,120
young would put together to deliver

904
00:43:53,490 --> 00:44:02,399
service to fulfill the service actually

905
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:04,109
so there's a critical gap actually they

906
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,430
were leader that I'd have young pay the

907
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:11,400
model actually like a sufficient input

908
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:15,299
from operators so to address this

909
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,160
actually one of the approach a way

910
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:22,500
proposed actually we can define young

911
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:24,960
they the model framework actually to

912
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,340
have operator to how to integrate the

913
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,810
young data model in the same namespace

914
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,340
and so we have a chapter actually posted

915
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:35,490
in OBS technologies that will be

916
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:40,680
discussed in OBS a publishing on one

917
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:43,200
Wednesday and try we actually we work

918
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:48,299
together with operator try try to fill

919
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:52,770
this gap to help operator to provide

920
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,510
such guideline how to you know figure

921
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:58,860
out how even a layer model can put

922
00:44:54,510 --> 00:45:02,100
together and in addition we we think you

923
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,050
know standard walk is not enough for

924
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,990
some of these you may rely more

925
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:11,870
coordination between

926
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:14,948
[Applause]

927
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,949
[Music]

928
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:28,750
okay I'm full hon Baker and this is the

929
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:31,780
mathematical mesh oh so internet

930
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:34,210
security is broken it's broken because

931
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,640
users are finding security it's just too

932
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,400
much effort and you can't solve that by

933
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,529
asking them to try harder it's broken

934
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,900
because applications are not solving the

935
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:46,150
real problem I mean like look at all the

936
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,270
data breaches their data at rest

937
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:51,970
breaches we mostly focus on transport

938
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,850
and we've not actually changed our

939
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:57,459
approach very much since the PGP are

940
00:45:54,850 --> 00:46:00,310
days and the Pam days we're still using

941
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:03,970
the same tool box and we're still using

942
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:06,240
the same limited number of operations so

943
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,799
the measure dress is three core problems

944
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,189
device management so you can glue all

945
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,830
your devices together so they're worn

946
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:17,200
gestalt contact management so you can

947
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:19,480
connect all the people that you connect

948
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,210
to together and have access to all their

949
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,120
public keys on all your devices and a

950
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,820
secure control plane messaging which is

951
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:32,410
end-to-end secure and traffic analysis

952
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:35,920
resistant Oh wrong so it's based on the

953
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:38,819
principle of I'm using more advanced

954
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,890
cryptography than in Bruce Schneier book

955
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,930
one key cryptography is great des you

956
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:46,270
know you can do a lot with des but two

957
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,770
key is better because you can separate

958
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:51,130
out the roles of encryption and

959
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:57,310
decryption if one is good and two is

960
00:46:51,130 --> 00:47:00,430
better why don't we try three four five

961
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:02,259
separate the roles out more and we can

962
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:07,830
do more cryptography and more

963
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:07,830
cryptography means more security yes

964
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,849
there's a bunch of small powerful

965
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:17,210
concepts here I can't go through these

966
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:19,849
at all but basically there's five basic

967
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,440
technologies here and it's a grab bag

968
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:23,570
and they're all designed to work

969
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,240
together but you can also use them a la

970
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:29,090
carte in your projects going to be

971
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:34,310
talking about this effects dispatched

972
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:38,300
tomorrow at 1:30 and this is the wrong

973
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:40,940
set of slides it seems a she sent in I'm

974
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,890
about to start releasing this so if

975
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:45,560
you've got a strong opinions on it

976
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:48,410
please talk to me before I release it

977
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:50,180
because the minute I have users I'm

978
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:53,540
going to start protecting legacy and

979
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:56,330
code if you want to change anything talk

980
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:58,430
before I release the code there's a

981
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:00,109
whole bunch of drafts and the drafts are

982
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,750
based on running code that comes from

983
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:05,299
the reference library so all in MIT

984
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,580
license all c-sharp all that good sir

985
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,440
and the objective here is to provide

986
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:12,710
people with kind of like a psychic learn

987
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,530
for cryptography if you look at the

988
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:19,010
advanced in AI that's happened over the

989
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:21,950
past ten years that happened after the

990
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,950
AI people made it really easy for people

991
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:28,009
to add AI into application with things

992
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:29,689
like pandas and scikit-learn so the

993
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,609
reference codes an attempt to do that's

994
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,520
the same thing for cryptography and

995
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:39,049
you've got all the same goodness of

996
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:42,859
blockchain pkcs7 PGP x.509 and so on but

997
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:45,410
in a much smaller library because if you

998
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:47,810
make all the systems use the same

999
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:50,390
unified approach you can get rid of a

1000
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:54,740
lot of code I've got rid of 2/3 of the

1001
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:55,910
code of the past two years so meetup so

1002
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,799
we're going to be talking about sex

1003
00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:01,598
dispatch tomorrow at 1:30 please be

1004
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,599
there or talk to me afterwards thank you

1005
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,860
I'll upload oh and there's also going to

1006
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:24,620
be podcasts explaining each part of this

1007
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:27,290
on the web I'm either Luba chef and I

1008
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,509
really want to talk to you about law

1009
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:34,100
packet loss detection in encrypted

1010
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:37,220
protocols I'm looking at quick alright

1011
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:40,430
I'm a transport guy I love to think of

1012
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:42,589
my networks as just dumb pipes but

1013
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,990
really for them to be dumb pipes there

1014
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:47,600
could be somebody inside that pipe who

1015
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:52,750
is looking for leaks and can find and

1016
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:56,540
page them quickly if it's senior TCP

1017
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:59,300
flow in that pipe it's pretty good

1018
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:02,450
she can look at sequence numbers at

1019
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:05,660
numbers figure out if there is leak see

1020
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:09,560
it if it's upstream downstream if she is

1021
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:12,710
looking at a quick flow not as good

1022
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:16,460
there is no really no bids to look at to

1023
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:20,570
see if the respect loss so it's I think

1024
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:25,870
it's a problem and there is a propose a

1025
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:28,910
solution that uses two bits one bit is a

1026
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:34,250
cube it stands for square signal it's

1027
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:37,819
very simple and that's in essence 64

1028
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:43,130
when you send in packet 64 of them comes

1029
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:45,410
zero cubed 64 one 64 0 so forth the

1030
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:50,240
other packet the other surahs a little

1031
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:52,819
bit is an else for loss event a bit and

1032
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,040
it is set when there's a special

1033
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,580
unreported loss counter which is greater

1034
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,120
than zero and unreported loss counter is

1035
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:04,490
maintained by the sender when there is a

1036
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,920
packet that the sender sent and depend

1037
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:09,680
sender deems it lost it increments the

1038
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,830
counter when the packet with l1 is sent

1039
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,470
the counter is decremented so if you can

1040
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:16,538
see the picture there are two packets in

1041
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:20,519
red the

1042
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:23,349
lost about one or tt-to one or two later

1043
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:28,569
Center determined they've been lost and

1044
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:30,749
it sent two packets with l1 okay how can

1045
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:33,459
we use that how is it useful so

1046
00:51:30,749 --> 00:51:36,009
end-to-end loss is pretty simple it's

1047
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:39,819
just a fraction of packets with l equals

1048
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:43,119
one bits that observer observed upstream

1049
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:45,969
loss is basically how many bits with a

1050
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,459
particular Q value are missing from a

1051
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:51,039
block once you have downstream and

1052
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:52,928
upstream loss you can figure out when

1053
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,669
you once you come end-to-end and

1054
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:59,979
upstream loss you can figure out the

1055
00:51:54,669 --> 00:52:02,049
downstream loss pretty cool so it's cool

1056
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:06,519
in theory but we decided to test it in

1057
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:09,640
practice Akamai's implemented a scheme

1058
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:12,269
based on this in our deployed servers

1059
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:15,279
and we've been serving quick traffic to

1060
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:18,279
some orange end users in a number of

1061
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:21,459
countries for for some time and there is

1062
00:52:18,279 --> 00:52:25,509
data for it actually real world data not

1063
00:52:21,459 --> 00:52:29,919
simulator or anything else and plenty

1064
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:31,630
and if you are interested I hope you are

1065
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:33,669
but if you're interested if you're an

1066
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:37,929
operator or have thoughts about it

1067
00:52:33,669 --> 00:52:41,859
please see us we'll be a here Monday

1068
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:47,159
tomorrow 8:30 to 9:30 for a side meeting

1069
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:50,069
and we'll talk about it in TS vwg on

1070
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:54,029
Thursday that's going to be focused on

1071
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:57,969
protocol details as well as privacy and

1072
00:52:54,029 --> 00:53:00,759
ossification risk and then on Friday

1073
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:03,669
onmyoji will actually present lots and

1074
00:53:00,759 --> 00:53:05,349
lots of data and talk about it and of

1075
00:53:03,669 --> 00:53:08,308
course you can talk to us

1076
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,309
Thanks

1077
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:14,950
brought me

1078
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:40,770
I'm broad and I want to talk about zero

1079
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:43,348
is not must be there are reserved does

1080
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:44,849
not must be zero we all know about these

1081
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:47,549
common words that are used throughout

1082
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:49,200
our RFC's there's a word I'd like to add

1083
00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:51,720
to that list and that's the word

1084
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,558
reserved because it is interpreted

1085
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,700
differently at times it's pretty

1086
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:01,559
frequently used it's poorly documented

1087
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,839
there's different ideas of exactly what

1088
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:08,789
it means and how it's used depending on

1089
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:12,509
in what context it's used this is is

1090
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:14,789
become a problem when it's when when

1091
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:17,760
reserved is treated this must be zero by

1092
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:19,770
a receiver and some future things come

1093
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,660
along and go that's not reserved anymore

1094
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:24,119
I want to use that for something else

1095
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,618
and somebody goes nope that must be zero

1096
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,329
we're gonna throw that packet away it's

1097
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:28,950
no good

1098
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:32,030
we're repeatedly running into this

1099
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:35,788
problem in protocol implementations in

1100
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:38,549
software and almost anything that uses

1101
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:41,670
the word reserved so I'm basically

1102
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:44,160
trying to bring the idea that we might

1103
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,990
want to clearly define this clearly

1104
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,029
define the different contexts that it

1105
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:53,700
can be used in and what it means in

1106
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:55,859
those contexts if they're this is this

1107
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:58,230
is gonna be a one minute talk if there's

1108
00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:00,328
any future discussion if people want to

1109
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:02,700
try and talk about let's codify this

1110
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:04,589
let's make an RFC out of it I'm

1111
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:08,009
available I'll be here all week there's

1112
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:09,299
my email address I've got a couple

1113
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:13,190
minutes if anybody wants to throw

1114
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:13,190
anything out about it right now we can

1115
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,049
do it do I hear you what can I hear a

1116
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:22,230
second on that motion should we should I

1117
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:24,829
start a draft okay that's what I wanted

1118
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,829
to hear thank you

1119
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,880
[Applause]

1120
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,790
hit one enter so slightly just hit one

1121
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:56,700
hit enter has to quickly jump to a slide

1122
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:59,250
number hello everyone my name is Stuart

1123
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:02,160
Cheshire as some of you may know I'm the

1124
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,860
creator of zero configuration networking

1125
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,020
and in a surf discovery and what Apple

1126
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:10,050
calls Bonjour I'm sure everybody knows

1127
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:12,060
it's used widely in Apple products what

1128
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,920
a lot of people don't realize is it's

1129
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,620
now in most Linux distributions

1130
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,320
it's used by chromecast it's on Android

1131
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:26,040
and it's starting Windows 10 it's even

1132
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:28,290
in Microsoft Windows anywhere in your

1133
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,660
software that you have somewhere for a

1134
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:32,580
user to type in an IP address or a host

1135
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:35,190
name you can use DNS service discovery

1136
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:38,040
to give them a list of options to choose

1137
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:40,320
from instead if you have iPhones here

1138
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,360
you can tap on AirPrint and you pick the

1139
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,330
printer you want there's nowhere to type

1140
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,580
an IP address if the thing you want

1141
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:49,560
doesn't show up you fix that by fixing

1142
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,529
the network not by typing in IP

1143
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,549
addresses on the client devices

1144
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:56,280
traditionally this is used peer-to-peer

1145
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:58,830
multicast what's great about that is it

1146
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,810
requires no infrastructure you just hook

1147
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:03,779
up two laptops with an Ethernet cable no

1148
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:06,000
switch they can discover each other two

1149
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,010
phones using peer-to-peer Wi-Fi no

1150
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,710
access points they can discover each

1151
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:13,230
other services that's great for small

1152
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:15,810
networks but it's inefficient on large

1153
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,340
networks because it impacts every device

1154
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,450
on the network even the ones you're not

1155
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,840
talking to right now

1156
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:23,970
it's slow on Wi-Fi because multicast is

1157
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,650
sent to low rate and multicast SAR

1158
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:28,919
batched with the beacon so there's high

1159
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:31,800
latency it's wasteful of shared wireless

1160
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,060
spectrum and it's unreliable because

1161
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,770
it's not acknowledged so you have to

1162
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,529
retransmit which makes it even more

1163
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:41,120
wasteful of that precious wireless

1164
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:41,120
spectrum with these slow transmissions

1165
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:47,670
so we want to discover things that are

1166
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:50,610
multiple hops away without flooding the

1167
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:53,460
multicast and if you do this with your

1168
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:56,160
iPhone today you send a multicast but

1169
00:57:53,460 --> 00:58:00,570
the printers not nearby we solve that by

1170
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,799
adding a discovery proxy your device now

1171
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:04,410
makes a TCP can

1172
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,760
action by sending IP packets multiple

1173
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:08,190
hops through that network

1174
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,740
the discovery proxy can then do the

1175
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:13,380
multicast on your behalf and send the

1176
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,180
answer back you discover the printer you

1177
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:19,200
can now make an end-to-end TCP

1178
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:22,109
connection and use that we'd love you to

1179
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,689
get involved you can join the DNS SD

1180
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:29,760
mailing list you can check out the code

1181
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:32,610
from the IETF hackathon we have an open

1182
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,280
wrt package for this little open wrt

1183
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:37,230
router in about five minutes you can add

1184
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,450
a discovery proxy to this and have one

1185
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,460
running on your own home network we'll

1186
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:43,950
be showing this at the hack demo happy

1187
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,240
hour tomorrow just across over there so

1188
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,609
you can come and see it working for

1189
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,529
yourself and of course come to our dns

1190
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:51,950
SD working group meeting on thursday

1191
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,950
thank you

1192
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:59,209
[Applause]

1193
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:15,250
shooting from Maui today I'm going to

1194
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:21,620
introduce you one of our new work is a

1195
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:25,430
application-aware ipv6 networking so

1196
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:28,490
first about the motivation as internet

1197
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:31,609
he involves we could say we have already

1198
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:33,890
experienced Oh IP the first generation

1199
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,110
but there are still some challenges

1200
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:39,759
for example the isolated the network

1201
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:43,700
Islands or the limited program program

1202
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:47,170
program ability and most importantly and

1203
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:50,960
the network is still on its own and

1204
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:55,430
application and the network isolated at

1205
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:57,800
the coupled and now we have ice our v6

1206
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:01,009
we could say we are entering a new

1207
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:04,850
generation all IP the second generation

1208
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:09,440
and ice our v6 has its own mission and

1209
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:13,040
first it is a based on ipv6 so it has

1210
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,680
the affinity to IP so it could be much

1211
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:20,690
easier to integrate the network domains

1212
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:23,629
and also it has the programmability so

1213
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:26,000
it has the programmer programmable

1214
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:28,670
fields so you could convey more

1215
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,250
information from the applications to the

1216
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:33,290
network so in that case you could

1217
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:36,700
integrate the application and the

1218
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:41,750
network make them to work together so

1219
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:44,779
here are the ipv6 extension hiders we

1220
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:46,940
have the hop by hop and destination

1221
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,180
options hiders and also the routing

1222
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:52,880
header i sorry choose one of these so we

1223
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:55,850
have the arguments views and also that

1224
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,010
here we you we could use to convey some

1225
01:00:55,850 --> 01:01:01,810
information from the applications and

1226
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:05,060
that are the foundations for the

1227
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:09,650
application aware ipv6 all eyes are

1228
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:12,590
basics networking we call it AP and 6 so

1229
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:16,310
basically we are actually make use of

1230
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:18,070
the ipv6 extension headers to convey

1231
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:21,070
some informations from the

1232
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:24,840
applications into the network so the

1233
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:29,230
network could make the flying granular

1234
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:32,440
traffic operations to do the for example

1235
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:35,680
the resort natural resources meant to

1236
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:38,350
guarantee the SLA so it could be applied

1237
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:41,560
to for example the fixed mobile

1238
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:44,259
broadband like the to be to see

1239
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:47,950
scenarios and also the mobile broadband

1240
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:50,410
and for the solution side we could have

1241
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:52,569
the host side solution that is the

1242
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:57,040
application directly put the information

1243
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:59,500
into the ipv6 hiders all it could be the

1244
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:01,600
network site solutions that is the

1245
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,820
network edge could attack the

1246
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,310
application and provide the information

1247
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:11,770
about the application and can wing it

1248
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:13,990
into the network and we are we are going

1249
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:17,350
to have a side meeting on Thursday

1250
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:21,279
Thursday morning and we have the agenda

1251
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:24,490
you could refer refer the related drafts

1252
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,500
we listed in the side meeting wiki okay

1253
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:32,839
thank you

1254
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:32,840
[Applause]

1255
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:24,509
we're on the backup USB stick I don't

1256
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:24,509
know why sorry okay

1257
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:35,130
yep

1258
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,808
great my name is Joseph Potvin I'm

1259
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:39,059
executive director for excel rhythms

1260
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:41,040
foundation some colleagues and I have

1261
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:42,780
initiated a project called

1262
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,730
an Internet of rules I'll say right away

1263
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,930
if you think it's a terrible name that

1264
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:48,750
we should not be calling what we're

1265
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:50,879
doing that please let us know I'll

1266
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:53,000
restrict this to the why and the what of

1267
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,260
what we're doing I could explain how

1268
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,349
there's running code behind this we're

1269
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,819
doing alpha testing right now but I've

1270
01:03:58,349 --> 01:04:01,950
had a very interesting conversations

1271
01:03:59,819 --> 01:04:04,380
over the last two days as part of the

1272
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:06,808
hackathon and there's lots of different

1273
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:12,000
ideas about and good ideas about how to

1274
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:13,799
do this next so very happy to see what

1275
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,040
Rodney was talking about a few sessions

1276
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:20,970
here ago we're actually working on the

1277
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:22,890
generalization of how words like must

1278
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:24,808
must not required shell and so forth

1279
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:27,839
actually get deployed so if you can

1280
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:29,339
imagine any IOT implementation and let's

1281
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,230
say there's some Court decision in some

1282
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:34,828
province or state and that's gonna

1283
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:37,470
affect privacy rules in terms of how

1284
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:40,349
data moves around from and to all sorts

1285
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:41,520
of IOT devices exactly how is that new

1286
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:43,140
rule going to get deployed you could

1287
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,210
even say oh it's going to get deployed

1288
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:47,460
through the equipment providers how is

1289
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:50,910
even that rule expressed and say English

1290
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:54,089
or or spanish going to get deployed to

1291
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:54,598
the 45,000 suppliers of these IOT

1292
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:57,180
devices

1293
01:04:54,599 --> 01:05:00,540
this affects issues in money finance

1294
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:02,279
commerce tax international trade machine

1295
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:05,490
control systems internet-based

1296
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:07,950
networking whatever it is the gap in

1297
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:09,750
this space is so huge it's hard to see

1298
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,009
so it's hard to communicate this

1299
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,450
sometimes because most people are

1300
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:16,680
looking for little gaps this is an

1301
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:18,750
enormous gap next so the problem is

1302
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,618
enormous ly wasteful error-prone

1303
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:23,849
redundancy each of you who is not from

1304
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,430
Canada when you pay your hotel bill

1305
01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:28,799
right now you're actually supposed to be

1306
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:30,750
zero rated on the value-added tax but

1307
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,000
you're going to pay it and if you were

1308
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:35,579
to try to claim it back on the way out

1309
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,220
good luck to you little rules like that

1310
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:41,099
come in and they were just simply not

1311
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:42,859
deployable today that's tax but any of

1312
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:45,560
these other domains you have

1313
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:47,120
same kind of problem it requires a

1314
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,070
domain-specific language which we've

1315
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,690
prototyped right now and not prototype

1316
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,990
we've actually implemented an alpha and

1317
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:56,150
an optimized algorithm search we're not

1318
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:59,660
dealing with if-then statements we're

1319
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:02,720
dealing with given X facts con has a

1320
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:05,330
context when there's an input fact for

1321
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,859
circumstance then Zed ought to be the

1322
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:12,100
case so these are just three facts next

1323
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:15,650
the actual software we have deployed

1324
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:18,200
begins by interacting with an API

1325
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:20,450
there's a small component piece and

1326
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,799
auxiliary piece called lichen you can

1327
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:23,299
use it or not use it it's a it's a

1328
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,550
reference implementation create your own

1329
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:27,950
if you like roll your own that provides

1330
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:30,740
the context FAQ in the input in fact out

1331
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:35,839
to the server in the server is a

1332
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:38,810
distributed set of servers with the

1333
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:40,040
collection of algorithms which implement

1334
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:45,020
the rules and these algorithms are

1335
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:48,500
simple declarative tabular or tupple

1336
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:51,320
oriented programs we deliver those back

1337
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:53,390
as output facts we do not inject them we

1338
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,280
stop at the point of delivering back the

1339
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:58,910
fact there that there is a rule and

1340
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,740
here's what it is and next please so

1341
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:03,140
Excel go the domain-specific language

1342
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:05,000
it's think of programming in terms of

1343
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:08,690
control tables decision tables and so

1344
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,970
forth with a few reserved words very

1345
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:13,670
very minimalist it's deliberately not

1346
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:15,140
turing-complete and it uses all any

1347
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:18,260
standard schema when it comes to

1348
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:21,350
identifying what industry it is what

1349
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:23,690
what jurisdiction it is what product

1350
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:29,240
type it is next please

1351
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:31,460
inter Libre sorry about it I'm okay

1352
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:34,160
that's the search engine and then next

1353
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:36,320
slide I'm presenting in this room on

1354
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:44,359
Tuesday 8:30

1355
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:44,359
[Applause]

1356
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,828
hi so I'm gonna talk a little bit about

1357
01:08:22,089 --> 01:08:25,420
multiple provisioning domains a term

1358
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:28,028
that you've probably heard and maybe

1359
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:30,880
know what it means but I think a lot of

1360
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:33,250
people don't so hence the talk so the

1361
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,139
point of this is back in the 1990s you

1362
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:37,029
had a host it was probably sitting on

1363
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:39,130
your desk it's connected to a network it

1364
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:40,389
got DNS and IP addresses somehow from

1365
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:45,159
the network and everything just worked

1366
01:08:40,389 --> 01:08:48,279
that was great good times times have

1367
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:49,448
changed and so recently and you know

1368
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:52,119
certainly in the 20 teens and even

1369
01:08:49,448 --> 01:08:53,528
before that it was not uncommon to have

1370
01:08:52,118 --> 01:08:57,429
a host connected to more than one

1371
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:59,679
network typical scenarios VPN is a

1372
01:08:57,429 --> 01:09:03,190
classic typical scenario but a less well

1373
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,569
less well understood scenario or is when

1374
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:06,189
you have a host is connected to say a

1375
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:10,839
phone for example that's connected to

1376
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:12,759
your cell service provider and to a

1377
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:14,979
wireless network which may have a

1378
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:16,599
captive portal on it you don't want your

1379
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:17,738
network service to suddenly stop because

1380
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:21,339
you're connected to the captive portal

1381
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:22,750
network so things get a little more

1382
01:09:21,339 --> 01:09:27,068
complicated when you have to deal with

1383
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:34,118
use cases like this that's a typo but

1384
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:38,079
anyway so anyway so so the host so if a

1385
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:39,608
host looks up a service using using

1386
01:09:38,078 --> 01:09:42,698
using the DNS server that it got from

1387
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:46,089
from network a it is and then tries to

1388
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:47,858
use the answer it got on network B if

1389
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:50,799
that service is actually only reachable

1390
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:53,139
on network a it's gonna fail so we need

1391
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,550
to be able to associate networks we need

1392
01:09:53,139 --> 01:10:00,369
to be able to associate things like DNS

1393
01:09:54,550 --> 01:10:02,139
servers and IP prefixes together and of

1394
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:04,839
course in the 2020s things are even more

1395
01:10:02,139 --> 01:10:07,440
exciting this is starting now but but

1396
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,699
you know you can see there there are

1397
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:13,419
routers that you can buy that have both

1398
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:16,210
a connector for your ISP and also a

1399
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,460
cellular backup and you'd like that to

1400
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:21,070
be able to work and you'd also like your

1401
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:24,369
devices on the home network to be able

1402
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:27,929
to distinguish between the two providers

1403
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:30,000
so how do you do that

1404
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:32,219
the answer is with provisioning domains

1405
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,870
so a provisioning domain is a connect

1406
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,219
collection of configuration information

1407
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:38,969
that's known to have come from the same

1408
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:40,699
source so in the previous example where

1409
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:42,540
we had network a and network B

1410
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:44,940
networking and network B were both

1411
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:47,550
different provisioning domains and

1412
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:49,259
similarly in the 2020s example where

1413
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:50,580
we've got provider a and provider B

1414
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:54,510
those are both also different

1415
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:56,100
provisioning domains so how do we

1416
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:59,969
communicate with this to the hosts in

1417
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,469
the 2010s usually we would just notice

1418
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:02,850
that we had two network interfaces and

1419
01:11:01,469 --> 01:11:04,710
so we would be able to set up an ad-hoc

1420
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:08,040
provisioning domain we would just assume

1421
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:10,949
that information that we got on an

1422
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,150
interface a and interface information

1423
01:11:10,949 --> 01:11:14,489
that we got an interface B are not

1424
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:16,309
interchangeable and and we would just do

1425
01:11:14,489 --> 01:11:20,009
that automatically without being told

1426
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:22,050
that doesn't work so well if you have a

1427
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:23,219
border router and you're behind the

1428
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:25,350
border router and the border router is

1429
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:26,699
connected to two different homes so in

1430
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:30,120
that case we need something called an

1431
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:33,299
explicit provisioning domain and so work

1432
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:34,890
has been going on in the ITF recently to

1433
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:39,570
make explicit provisioning domains

1434
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:40,890
happen so the original work was done in

1435
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:42,989
the myth working group we produced a

1436
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:45,030
document called the multiple multiple

1437
01:11:42,989 --> 01:11:46,530
provisioning domain architecture which

1438
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,849
explained the problem that I just

1439
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:51,330
explained to you in quite a bit more

1440
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:56,010
detail and more accuracy but didn't

1441
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:58,590
actually solve it and then just recently

1442
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:00,150
a number of folks in the interior

1443
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:02,550
working group been working on a document

1444
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:04,320
called draft end area providing domains

1445
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,840
discovering provisioning domain names

1446
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,799
and data so this is using an RA option

1447
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,600
to explicitly state that this prefix and

1448
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,670
all the information about this prefix is

1449
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:18,989
in its own provisioning domain which has

1450
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:21,360
this name and so that work is almost

1451
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:22,650
done I'm mostly telling you about this

1452
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:25,059
because I think it's really useful and

1453
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:31,820
you want to know please come to intern

1454
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:39,710
[Applause]

1455
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:39,710
Spencer Spencer

1456
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:02,950
so Spitzer Dawkins and talking a little

1457
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:06,340
bit about performance implication of

1458
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:08,349
path characteristics this is a Rube

1459
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,520
Goldberg machine which actually turns

1460
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:12,490
out to be a pretty good implementation

1461
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:17,970
of what I think a lot of network paths

1462
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:21,760
look like these days so how we got here

1463
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:25,740
we did a follow on to the tcp over

1464
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:28,660
satellite working group in 1997 to 2000

1465
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:31,840
talking about very long RTT interaction

1466
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:34,240
with slow lost recovery we I brought a

1467
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:37,240
proposal for TCP over cellular to the

1468
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:40,330
IETF and the ad suggested a structured

1469
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:43,870
approach instead of doing TCP over foo

1470
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:48,340
links Aaron and I co-chaired the pilk

1471
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:50,230
working group 1999 to 2004 and we had

1472
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:57,520
specific recommendations that we issued

1473
01:13:50,230 --> 01:14:00,459
it's BCPs most of them for specific link

1474
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:04,750
characteristics and that was adopted

1475
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:07,090
actually by web forum version 2 was life

1476
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:10,420
was good for a while things have

1477
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:12,550
probably changed since 2004

1478
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:15,220
a lot of stuff is on here there's

1479
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:17,890
actually probably more things that have

1480
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:18,190
changed that then I didn't put on the

1481
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,590
slide

1482
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:23,230
things like CD ends and stuff like that

1483
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:25,660
but you know a lot has been going on

1484
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:27,250
that'd be just to pick one of them we

1485
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,260
weren't thinking about multipath at all

1486
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:32,830
we were thrilled we could get one path

1487
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:39,280
to work so what I'd like to do at IETF

1488
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:44,140
105 we had a side meeting and went out

1489
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:45,940
at ITF one 104 in the code lounge and

1490
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,340
that was helpful so I was going to

1491
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,500
another one of those meetings but I've

1492
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:52,360
also been told

1493
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:55,690
active in the panarchy research group

1494
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:57,160
and they've been thinking about path

1495
01:14:55,690 --> 01:15:00,040
aware networking I'd like to talk to

1496
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:04,780
them about what is engineering and what

1497
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:06,550
is research so what's ready for the ITF

1498
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:09,759
tournament record nations for

1499
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:12,010
and was not ready for the ietf to make

1500
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:16,390
recommendations for independent that's

1501
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:17,680
the wind energy is meeting the thing you

1502
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,720
know so like I say the thing that I'm

1503
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:23,290
saying here that I need to make pretty

1504
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:25,780
clear is that I'm talking about I'm

1505
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:28,840
talking about producing BCPs for

1506
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:31,259
protocol designers because we still get

1507
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,310
a lot of product we still get a lot of

1508
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:36,610
proposals from people who are trying to

1509
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:39,880
solve specific problems with

1510
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:42,250
well-meaning ideas that the transport

1511
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:45,370
community has identified problems with a

1512
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:49,180
long time ago but we never write those

1513
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:53,230
things down my favorite one was you know

1514
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:56,950
if you read my PhD dissertation from ten

1515
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:58,950
years ago you would clearly see that and

1516
01:15:56,950 --> 01:16:02,170
that was the best that was the best

1517
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:03,910
recommendation we had I think the ITF

1518
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:06,790
has done better in the past I think we

1519
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:10,990
could do better hope to see you on

1520
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:15,180
Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon

1521
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:17,950
[Applause]

1522
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:19,600
so for those of you not keeping track

1523
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,920
we're down to the last three talks if

1524
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,390
you're thinking about dinner maybe a

1525
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,710
little bit hungry we should be out of

1526
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:28,000
here in about 15 minutes so you can

1527
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:32,190
start making your plans but our next

1528
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,190
speaker is use out to talk about loops

1529
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:43,150
I only have a single page yeah so we

1530
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:45,130
should finish with much lesser than 50

1531
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:48,940
minutes I only have a single page here

1532
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:51,610
and I'm gonna give a simple okay

1533
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:54,610
announcement on the loops path because

1534
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:58,269
this is one of the very first sessions

1535
01:16:54,610 --> 01:17:01,690
of ITF so I want you guys who were

1536
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:04,990
possibly just here and with your jetlag

1537
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:07,929
aware that this time the session starts

1538
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:09,940
from 10 okay so tomorrow morning 10

1539
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:12,640
o'clock we are going to have the pub

1540
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:17,490
loops which stands for the local

1541
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:20,440
optimization and path segments okay the

1542
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:23,349
okay give a very simple description the

1543
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:25,450
path of a long-haul Network can be

1544
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:28,720
naturally or purposely partitioned into

1545
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:31,570
multiple segments via possibly like

1546
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:36,190
tunnel stitching so loops aims to

1547
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:38,620
provide loss recovery locally over some

1548
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:41,740
specific segments so that's the basic

1549
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:44,170
idea of loops so here are two pointers

1550
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:46,210
of the drafts so please read them and

1551
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:48,000
please join us tomorrow morning 10:00

1552
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:54,710
okay thanks

1553
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,710
[Applause]

1554
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:10,650
so I'm team April I'm here to talk

1555
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:13,409
quickly about the DNS transparency

1556
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:16,348
project many of you are probably

1557
01:18:13,409 --> 01:18:17,669
familiar about how DNS works it's pulled

1558
01:18:16,349 --> 01:18:19,829
a system where there's no way to

1559
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:22,320
currently get a push based notification

1560
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:25,849
to arbitrary end-users without having to

1561
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:28,380
arrange something with the DNS provider

1562
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:29,909
this means that any short-term changes

1563
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,909
in the DNS that aren't being actively

1564
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:35,688
monitored well will get missed and there

1565
01:18:32,909 --> 01:18:38,369
have been recent attacks if you look at

1566
01:18:35,689 --> 01:18:40,530
if you were to go in Google for sea

1567
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:42,929
turtle or DNS panel as you can see hold

1568
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:44,249
right up on some of these attacks that

1569
01:18:42,929 --> 01:18:46,519
took advantage of this some of the

1570
01:18:44,249 --> 01:18:49,199
weaknesses in that in the current model

1571
01:18:46,519 --> 01:18:51,119
this project is proposing to create a

1572
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,249
system where there's a push or

1573
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,199
generating a push based model where we

1574
01:18:53,249 --> 01:18:57,179
get data from registries and then

1575
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:58,379
propagated out through a pub sub sort of

1576
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:00,360
system to the end users that are

1577
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,979
interested that could be a registrant it

1578
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:05,070
could be a user or all sorts of things

1579
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:07,169
like that and this would get hopefully

1580
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:09,719
real-time updates from as many TL DS and

1581
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:12,269
then possibly later on second and third

1582
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:13,590
level domains as possible and then it'll

1583
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:15,539
aggregate that and ship it out to

1584
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:19,519
whoever wants to get it in hopefully

1585
01:19:15,539 --> 01:19:21,030
real-time or near real-time formats

1586
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:23,070
there are a whole bunch of people

1587
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:24,749
involved you can talk to any of us I

1588
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:27,630
think there's only two of us here this

1589
01:19:24,749 --> 01:19:29,459
week but the two of us that are here

1590
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:31,559
will be here all week we've also been

1591
01:19:29,459 --> 01:19:32,400
working with some people from a couple

1592
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:34,800
different governments around the world

1593
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:38,999
to try and figure out what exactly the

1594
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,260
consumers need and then if the things

1595
01:19:38,999 --> 01:19:42,059
we're looking for right now if you're a

1596
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,559
registry or registry operator would be

1597
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:46,050
interested to talk about possibly what

1598
01:19:43,559 --> 01:19:49,169
we could do to get data if you're a

1599
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:50,849
registrar or authority operators we'd be

1600
01:19:49,169 --> 01:19:52,829
interested to talk later on about how we

1601
01:19:50,849 --> 01:19:55,349
can get some of your data if you just

1602
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:57,449
want to see we have a very simple web

1603
01:19:55,349 --> 01:19:58,619
page up there and we also have a form

1604
01:19:57,449 --> 01:20:00,959
where you can fill it if you want to get

1605
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:03,630
more information as we get more data

1606
01:20:00,959 --> 01:20:07,679
than ships out we're in the process of

1607
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:09,059
trying to stand up or merge with a be

1608
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,070
taken under some other existing

1609
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:14,159
nonprofit an independent agency or

1610
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:16,709
independent organization so we can have

1611
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:17,129
a independent status and build something

1612
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:19,290
that's hope

1613
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:21,270
fully available to the community at

1614
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:26,610
large and we're hoping to make it free

1615
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:28,020
to end-users so there's the link if you

1616
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:29,159
have any questions find me this week I

1617
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:41,330
don't want to stay in between you and

1618
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:41,330
dinner all right thank you so the last

1619
01:20:41,659 --> 01:20:48,480
session there less talk is mine so I

1620
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,800
know some of you know about this have

1621
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,049
been participating in it but not

1622
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,330
everybody maybe so this is kind of a

1623
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:56,070
hobby little side project I've been

1624
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:59,400
doing at ITF meetings which is to try to

1625
01:20:56,070 --> 01:21:01,290
do a little social event that's modeled

1626
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:05,699
on the sitcom outrageous opinion session

1627
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:08,370
and it was the ideas to do some

1628
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:10,500
satirical talks I was calling it bad

1629
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:12,090
idea Pecha Kucha for a while trying to

1630
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,400
generalize it to not strictly be Pecha

1631
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,050
Kucha format we've got several folks

1632
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,730
signed up now and I saw a few come into

1633
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:20,040
my inbox during the session so I think

1634
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:23,009
the list is growing it's Thursday night

1635
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:25,139
at 9:30 in Duluth which I think is the

1636
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:27,179
