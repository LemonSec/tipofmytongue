1
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,880
that's funny

2
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,880
but that is like

3
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:09,500
hi if you're here for something other

4
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:12,769
than Zack dispatch oh where you would

5
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,180
like to be otherwise welcome um

6
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:20,630
Kathleen Moriarty Richard Barnes

7
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,320
together we are sick this bet all of us

8
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:26,650
together

9
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,650
I say we will dispatch to you all right

10
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:39,020
note the note well alright so logistics

11
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,990
I guess the first presentation will fall

12
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,780
out of the normal format and Michael

13
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,370
Richardson is gonna talk for four

14
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,919
minutes and present for four and the

15
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,139
rest of them have a 15-minute time slot

16
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,880
I think we're gonna be 15 minutes

17
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:58,669
presentation if it's a nice discussion

18
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:01,159
yes anyone have last-minute

19
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:06,099
modifications or proposals for agenda

20
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,100
items last call before we launch into it

21
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,750
all right seeing no agenda bashes

22
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,409
Michael Richardson please join us on the

23
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,590
stage there's a pink X up here with your

24
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,590
name

25
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:37,930
we got the bigger than in this video hi

26
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:59,700
hello okay

27
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,670
hi I'm Michael Richardson and I have

28
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,990
been working on a document called

29
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,690
bootstrapping key infrastructure and

30
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,370
it's an extension of RFC 70:30 which was

31
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,290
produced by the PKK's working group and

32
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,450
in the process of doing Interop testing

33
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,450
we discovered some hoops ins next slide

34
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:25,230
so RFC 70/30 runs over HTTPS and lets

35
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,320
you view certificate enrollment using

36
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,440
CMC methods and throughout the document

37
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,800
it believes it's running over sy and

38
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,810
rather than HTTP as a result it asks you

39
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,780
to put content transfer encoding heading

40
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,780
your headers in with the say base64 and

41
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,300
and then asks you to basically for stuff

42
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:53,790
that could be binary and so that was a

43
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,800
bit confusing so it turns out that it

44
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,500
turns out that there are no actual real

45
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,570
implementations out there of it that

46
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,640
actually put the content transfer

47
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,950
encoding header in because it's actually

48
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,780
deprecated by all the HTTP documents so

49
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:12,000
implementers are left wondering does

50
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,659
that mean that I should put binary in

51
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,270
the in what's there or base64-encoded

52
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,050
and the answer is the document said to

53
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,150
base64 encode it so they did with the

54
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,290
result that people were like oh okay

55
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,370
it's basic C 4 encoded well is Bruschi

56
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,580
base64 encoded even though it doesn't

57
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:35,280
say it and therefore we got into

58
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,630
confusion things and it also makes it a

59
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,549
little more confusing because people

60
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,310
like to run things with curl which is

61
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,470
really hard to dump binary objects into

62
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,760
it but really easy to jump base64 things

63
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,250
in and people don't always realize

64
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,080
whether they're providing a convenient

65
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,700
encoding to curl or whether they're

66
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,789
actually that's what they're

67
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,830
transmitting anyway so this is a

68
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,070
document that basically shrimps to

69
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,140
clarify these four four points two of

70
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,980
them errata were raised by Shawn Turner

71
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,979
next slide actually

72
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,349
the content part two of them are raised

73
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,710
by by Sean Turner on this topic there is

74
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:16,438
an ASN one complaint about the document

75
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,388
that it does it wrong and I actually and

76
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,349
not I have no idea if it's right or

77
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:25,009
wrong and I need help on that and then

78
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:28,050
finally there's a typo that apparently

79
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:29,669
in extra space that apparently when

80
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,830
implementation believed was mandatory

81
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,598
and insisted was there and then they

82
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,549
realized it was just it was a

83
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,880
typographic issue in the document when

84
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:40,139
they tried to interoperate so those are

85
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,448
four things that just a simple

86
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,370
clarification document on it I don't

87
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:49,109
think it's worth revising the best Ness

88
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,670
document next slightly I don't believe

89
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,399
it's worth revising the document are

90
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,040
doing abyss at this point you may have

91
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,660
seen my zero zero zero one documents

92
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,639
which went on the assumption that

93
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,410
content transfer encoding was actually

94
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,930
being sent we actually could upgrade

95
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,380
everything to binary if only we could

96
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,899
change the what was there and after a

97
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,180
fair number of feedback we realized this

98
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,130
was impossible it's got to stay the way

99
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,189
it is and we just need to document it as

100
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:24,600
this is broken in the following way

101
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:25,980
deal that's it any questions you know

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,959
four minutes for questions if anyone

103
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,990
would like to ask clarifications about

104
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:32,459
the verification stuff or tell tell this

105
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:37,949
group where the document should be

106
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:39,989
processed so just to recall the dispatch

107
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,670
options we could form a new working

108
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,149
group from this document yeah you could

109
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,589
pull the ball we could dispatch the

110
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,750
existing working group right maybe

111
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:51,180
sponsor or we could tell you to go away

112
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,189
are you telling your they ya gong yeah

113
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,979
my suggestion is either to send it the

114
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:58,199
documents of lamps which vaguely has

115
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,480
impaired and P kick stuff and probably

116
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:04,979
has the asn.1 clue to fix the other part

117
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,949
or ad sponsor it and I believe Alexei

118
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,560
has volunteered it just be better folks

119
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:13,260
think that's appropriate Martin um non

120
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,699
Thompson I have a slight preference for

121
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,500
going to an existing working group if

122
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,649
you but an existing working group if you

123
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,629
if you can find one that

124
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:21,860
is willing to take on the work some of

125
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:23,509
these working groups don't really have

126
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,869
the charters for it which makes it a

127
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:28,910
little tricky so I don't really mind I

128
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:31,459
also prefer that because I think it will

129
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,839
get the better early review on the a s

130
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:37,579
and one thing that it needs rather than

131
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:39,589
happening at and discusses so um the

132
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,449
thing that occurs is perhaps you could

133
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:45,110
monkey patch this in some way using

134
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:46,910
content encoding to avoid that base64

135
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,449
issue but I don't know if we have a

136
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:54,589
base64 content encoding so that that

137
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:56,508
would be new work and so it might you

138
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,149
know content transfer encoding is not a

139
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:02,749
thing in HTTP so yeah let's not pretend

140
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:05,089
that happen but we might be able to do

141
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:07,519
something that will for those that

142
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:11,689
implement this correctly up to the new

143
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:16,790
standard won't result in any confusion

144
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:21,319
terms so of the four or five actions

145
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:24,860
that are defined all but one are posts

146
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:26,420
and so you have to the client has to

147
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,660
somehow guess having never spoken to the

148
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,689
server before like whether it accepts

149
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,969
this new format or not and that turns

150
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:36,709
out to be non-trivial unless we I don't

151
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,569
know we go LPN or something I don't know

152
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:41,660
what but do know me

153
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:45,009
I think it's do not fix just yeah so

154
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:48,050
just document it yeah

155
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:49,790
all right so the hi I'm Sean Turner the

156
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,420
joke comm is we should just rename lamps

157
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,709
P kicks wait forever but I think you

158
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,229
should probably send it there since it's

159
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,550
already kind of the P kicks thing even

160
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,800
sorry shouldn't you should send it to

161
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,049
lamps lamps and you should rename P

162
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,969
kicks or lamps Topeka X Prime or

163
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:07,399
something great like that made long live

164
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,990
forever I think we should definitely fix

165
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,279
these things I think I don't know I was

166
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,259
considering whether we could use the

167
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,540
HTTP except header to try to tell the

168
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:15,829
server what you support there was

169
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,089
something that Mark Nottingham suggested

170
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,170
at one point that maybe there's some way

171
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,490
we could figure out how to do that I

172
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,378
don't know if that'll work but it's

173
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,850
something to propose and I guess in the

174
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:25,009
errata that I submitted there were some

175
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,290
suggestions for workarounds about should

176
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,670
be except to do this so that so maybe

177
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,439
those weasel worrying work and maybe it

178
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,209
won't fit and that actually works great

179
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:34,880
for the response

180
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,220
and I actually implemented it but it

181
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,070
doesn't work for the post and then I

182
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,550
went oh so I will step out of the way

183
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,560
because I know I'm no expert

184
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,150
hi Berman didn't you we can say lamps

185
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,130
and that that's okay I'd love to hear

186
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,510
folks are directing conferred Lance I

187
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,210
would just remind we probably need to

188
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:57,319
have a charter conversation yeah exactly

189
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,940
so Rick Sol's the other reason that send

190
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,830
it to lamps is that's where Jim shod and

191
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:07,130
Russ Housley hang out and they are the

192
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:08,830
asn.1 experts so thank you for making my

193
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,990
point for me

194
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,340
month olds back on the post issue there

195
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,490
is now say that talks about content

196
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:19,430
encoding and client requests and I think

197
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,690
that we're almost in that area and so

198
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,150
there's a there's a bunch of text about

199
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,510
how to deal with that in that RC I can

200
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,100
send it positive which document is this

201
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,720
our seed med mid that I can't remember

202
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,390
off the top of my head but I'll find it

203
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:38,270
for you and send it off 72 72 30 series

204
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:40,010
or or something else 70 to 30 so but one

205
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,079
of those you mean yeah something

206
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,750
something in the HTTP area yes

207
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:50,180
okay about about content negotiation for

208
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:51,350
post is what you're saying for okay

209
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,780
exactly what are you talking about

210
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,720
okay this is so the speakers know

211
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,110
there's echoes off of this wall so it's

212
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,900
weird

213
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,150
I can hear it I can hear him both

214
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:06,050
directly and off the wall and off the

215
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:08,270
speaker so it's just really weird yeah

216
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,160
Martin speak up so Michael it sounds

217
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,480
like your preference is to go to lamps

218
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,199
there's some comments from the floor

219
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,610
that dispatch this to lamps Russell's a

220
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,770
standing up is he coming to the mic as

221
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:23,600
lamps chair okay Hades I'm looking to

222
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,340
units I'm like a pause block um okay

223
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,680
great so well consider this dispatched

224
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:33,140
two lamps then thank you

225
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,859
next up is dave carroll or some

226
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,860
controller Ike

227
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:50,939
okay it's like yeah oh they're up I

228
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,529
can't see there should be a quicker

229
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:54,529
there if you want try driving yourself

230
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:05,879
does this not work

231
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:08,519
alright umm so I'm here to talk about

232
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:12,269
controller Ike this is something we

233
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,489
started doing in SD when work and it's

234
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:18,509
been growing in the routing group a lot

235
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:23,369
of interest in it it is basically a key

236
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:25,579
management protocol there what is it

237
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:27,989
Ike is basically a key management

238
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,719
protocol that will drop in in place of

239
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:33,239
standard Ike except it works through a

240
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,459
controller you know the concept is there

241
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:41,069
is no peer-to-peer direct messaging at a

242
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,410
high level it's pretty simple so what

243
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:45,269
we're doing is a different exchange just

244
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,789
like you know the idea is to try to make

245
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:50,249
it similar to diffie-hellman you would

246
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:52,350
do in Ike but we're doing it through a

247
00:15:50,249 --> 00:16:01,410
controller and we're trying to keep the

248
00:15:52,350 --> 00:16:03,209
scale of the messaging down yeah so the

249
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,358
problem we came up with that we had to

250
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:08,039
address was that we had we're doing

251
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:11,009
large-scale networks we were doing

252
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:13,829
10,000 plus nodes in a full mesh and

253
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:15,359
there was too much hike going on the

254
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:20,099
amount of traffic over the network was

255
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:23,189
too high the complexity just was not

256
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,049
manageable as an N squared and so by

257
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:28,730
coming up with a controller based model

258
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:31,410
we've reduced the messaging to order n

259
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,989
control basically each peer creates a

260
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,209
different public value sends it to the

261
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:39,660
controller controller collects these all

262
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:41,789
and sends them all down the concept is

263
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,868
very simple where this gets interesting

264
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:47,329
is when you try to synchronize if you

265
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:49,320
obviously you'll have to do rekeying and

266
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:51,420
when rekeying happy

267
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,010
you have the problem that keys get

268
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,099
distributed to different periods at

269
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,720
different times for redundancy reasons

270
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,550
you'll want to have multiple controllers

271
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:05,120
the state isn't always the same and so

272
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:07,530
the draft that we put forward is

273
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,329
addresses the synchronization and shows

274
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,040
how you can handle that with a

275
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:20,430
centralized controller base to key

276
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:25,920
exchange yeah and the key there is no

277
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:27,750
peer-to-peer messaging what isn't it

278
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,640
we're not pushing this as a replacement

279
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:35,670
to Ike obviously I guess stood the test

280
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,400
of time it's around but in certain

281
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:42,330
models this is we find this it to be a

282
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,760
little more ideal it is also not a

283
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,960
two-way attribute negotiation protocol

284
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:52,140
you can you can end up with two peers in

285
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,650
Ike that we may offer different things

286
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,970
and the other wants in in this there is

287
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,610
much more of a limit

288
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,530
you've got to but but in this model

289
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:06,090
worth coming from a centralized

290
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:08,820
controller and so we're not as worried

291
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:12,840
about needing to negotiate completely

292
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:17,580
disparate options there is a small

293
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,679
ability to negotiate a hierarchy for you

294
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,290
know you may have a couple of algorithms

295
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:27,900
and you can negotiate down I won't go

296
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:30,180
into the details but it's in there and

297
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,220
the other the other key to this is we're

298
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,920
not providing the secure communication

299
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,200
to the controller so this is a protocol

300
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:42,210
that is embedded in something else in

301
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,460
the VIP Telos cisco the the Pella

302
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,670
sp1 products we have our own protocol

303
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,970
that is secure in the routing working

304
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:53,310
groups we are working with bgp insecure

305
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,930
bgp messages and that's all taken care

306
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,679
of as part of the communication to the

307
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,680
route reflector

308
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:06,080
so why do we want to do this so the key

309
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,960
for us is optimization we reduce the

310
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,990
complexity reproduce the messaging from

311
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,940
N squared to n but there's there's other

312
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,880
attributes to this that are really have

313
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,460
been really helpful for us in SD Wham's

314
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,470
so one of the one of the keys that we

315
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,040
found is we have customers that want to

316
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,950
do control over a managed secure network

317
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,030
they may have an MPLS link that's

318
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,680
provision they have whatever they have

319
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:36,530
but the data doesn't necessarily go over

320
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,900
that same network and this allows us to

321
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:42,770
do control over one messaging over

322
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,840
another the other side of it is we work

323
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,570
at at least one customer that had some

324
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,720
very odd shaped networks they had links

325
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,939
that were not bi-directional and so you

326
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,640
have a case where two peers cannot talk

327
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,280
to each other by directionally but they

328
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,900
can each talk to the controller and so

329
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,790
we can provide a way to do key

330
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:08,090
management and still have a one-way

331
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:11,659
IPSec tunnel so where is this being used

332
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:14,689
I'll throw it a few drafts here these

333
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,720
are things that are being pushed forward

334
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:20,630
in some other working groups I know

335
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,650
IDR I think it's tomorrow is gonna be

336
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,260
talking a lot about security

337
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:28,160
architecture and directions that this is

338
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,450
headed and this is it hopefully intended

339
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,450
to be one part of that architecture

340
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:43,370
Wednesday got it not tomorrow and you

341
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,930
know and this has been discussed drafts

342
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,129
with this have been presented in best

343
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:51,290
it's been discussed in IDR even the I to

344
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,070
NSF work has looked into this and this

345
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:57,440
could fit in very well with the I to NSF

346
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,939
infrastructure though not as the not as

347
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:05,300
the messaging portion just the

348
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:07,930
configuration much like Ike who will

349
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,930
skip by that

350
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,379
so when is when is stuff happening there

351
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,500
are currently two implementations of

352
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,990
this draft that are known to be there to

353
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,440
be fair and honest they are very

354
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,440
incestuously related so maybe it's not

355
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,140
quite - but the stuff is working it is

356
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,700
going it's also currently under

357
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,500
consideration a number of working groups

358
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,680
that are looking to try to integrate a

359
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:42,740
controller based key management for uh

360
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:45,510
for SD lands for overlay networking and

361
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,780
then this is kind of my last slide I've

362
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:51,660
tried to do this rather quickly and the

363
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:58,830
next question is one can we do something

364
00:21:51,660 --> 00:22:09,690
else something to move forward Erika

365
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:12,270
scroll so I guess first answer to a

366
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,560
clarifying question on when you say it's

367
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,629
not in squared

368
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,740
it's n what do you what units are you

369
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:22,170
counting in messages okay cuz it is N

370
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,240
squared in helmand calculations are

371
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,100
still N squared sin squared data

372
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,860
transmission as well right because you

373
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,060
have to send every grace to send and

374
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,439
October since and out everybody can

375
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,710
write so if those are unidirectional

376
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,370
connections they still one squared right

377
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,290
it's 2n everybody sends a message up to

378
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,389
the controller the controller sends a

379
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,550
message down to everybody else but that

380
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,410
message can if that's the addressing

381
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,960
data in messages right anyway this is 2n

382
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,730
it's order n again if you're counting

383
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:58,560
messages versus bytes things are very

384
00:22:50,730 --> 00:23:00,510
very different but anyway so on your

385
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,790
pain I mean so this is like by the way

386
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,230
skip um in case nobody here people don't

387
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,700
remember history this is basically the

388
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,190
same protocol that Sun originally

389
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,880
proposed Friday SEC and was and we ended

390
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,320
up selecting Ike and as we've skipped

391
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,170
you're paying a lot for this which is

392
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,980
you're not getting PFS and you have the

393
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:26,490
odd protocol design without confirmation

394
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:29,159
so I guess I guess as I said of my email

395
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:32,880
um an alternative design is to do

396
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,610
effectively is to basically do key

397
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,990
establishment only when you need it and

398
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,490
then basically overhead you're paying is

399
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,559
whatever messages you're sending in

400
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,519
addition to the actual communication

401
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,330
you're setting because I assume you do

402
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:48,240
intend to send packets right do intend

403
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,889
to send data packets right exactly um so

404
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,450
not necessarily bidirectionally

405
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:53,039
understood but you don't need but on

406
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,880
there there are plenty of designs which

407
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,110
don't require by commercial

408
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:01,399
communication and still get you better

409
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:04,019
guarantees than this does so you know

410
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm not trying to push forward that this

411
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:10,769
draft is the be-all end-all protocol for

412
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,090
a controller based model but I would

413
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:15,090
like to start the discussion on a

414
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:18,209
controller based model not using the

415
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,699
peer-to-peer well I guess I would

416
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,840
encourage you to sharpen I encourage you

417
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,720
to see the requirements where I wasn't

418
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,500
stating the design you're looking for um

419
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,600
because it seems to me that the

420
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,519
requirements bit won't back out of this

421
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,719
don't necessarily get you to the

422
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,429
conclusion you just got to okay I'm not

423
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,570
sure what requirements are well you're

424
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,269
saying you don't want to do peer to peer

425
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,590
but why I'm slow say again you said you

426
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,620
don't want to do peer to peer but what

427
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,480
we source are you conserving i I don't

428
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,158
always have peer-to-peer bi-directional

429
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:53,190
communication I'm conserving Methodism

430
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,230
Natives it's not just like propose an

431
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,299
alternative hypothetical here imagining

432
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,659
everyone has bi-directional connectivity

433
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:03,750
to a controller one one design you could

434
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:06,779
adopt is to do normal Ike directly

435
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,000
between the normal Ike from one peer to

436
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:12,480
another but tunneled via those

437
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,840
controller connections right as well so

438
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,190
so that you do normal Ike full mesh but

439
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,269
over the controller connection because

440
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,399
you have bi-directional constant

441
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:22,260
connectivity that way so I guess I I

442
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:23,760
think kind of what occurs asking is like

443
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,340
how does this design differ from that

444
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,289
one given that both of those use the

445
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,799
controller to route messages between the

446
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:33,299
various endpoints well at that point you

447
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,790
know again now you're doing N squared

448
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,920
message

449
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,899
and you're doing it all through the

450
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:45,250
controller which is going to become

451
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:47,500
quite a bottleneck I this this is where

452
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,770
we came up with as a more optional I was

453
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,560
right that so my follow up that might

454
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:57,340
clarify what Richards and my question is

455
00:25:53,560 --> 00:26:00,700
do you have a goal to be able to work

456
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,199
between split brain controllers where

457
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,380
there's multiple controllers and they no

458
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,780
longer the partitions in parts of the

459
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,950
network and still have things happen in

460
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,570
other words do you have an idea that you

461
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,740
might also be doing ike between

462
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:16,870
controllers to build meshes between

463
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,570
networks that were partitioned as for us

464
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:22,840
from there on their control links I have

465
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,669
implementations that do that today we

466
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,889
work we work with multiple and other

467
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,480
local controllers where each peer may

468
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,490
only talk to one of the controller

469
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,610
doesn't look like IP to between the two

470
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:37,090
controllers it does not do i ke to

471
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:40,750
between it does something very very

472
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:43,600
similar to this so please Holly said

473
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:47,310
Jesse so one of the use cases for the

474
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:51,429
controller is bgp route reflector and

475
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:54,550
our redundancy built into it and we do

476
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:59,470
this point emotionally it is been there

477
00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:02,490
past 15 20 years being truant and the

478
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,590
idea and we've have we've had many

479
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:09,750
services VPN services based on this

480
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:15,929
controller last but not least a VPN and

481
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:18,910
there is requirement to be able to add

482
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:21,910
security features to evpn and leverage

483
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:24,910
that controller and this is one of the

484
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:27,670
draft that we are introducing in the

485
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,700
best and ideal working group and it is

486
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,860
getting good traction and the idea is I

487
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:37,120
have the controller I'm doing this

488
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,699
signaling for my VPN and many other

489
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,899
things I'd like to be able to use the

490
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,900
same controller to

491
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:51,520
to leverage it for point-to-point

492
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,560
tunneling soda so the signaling

493
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,080
connection is point-to-multipoint the

494
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,210
signaling but the tunnel

495
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,620
IPSec tunnel that they set up as a

496
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,730
result of their signaling his

497
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,389
point-to-point and the work in terms of

498
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:09,760
how the signaling is done as I said

499
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:13,150
we've introduced a trap in best and

500
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:22,660
we're getting fairly good very good

501
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:25,270
interest on it then the downbar from

502
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,120
choo-choo I I strongly support this

503
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:30,120
proposal I think the IPSec have been the

504
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,820
industry for many decades right

505
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,830
primarily is peer to peer however in

506
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,389
today's environment for example for

507
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,240
enterprise going to the cloud or

508
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:42,370
Enterprise going to multiple clouds you

509
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,130
have an edge device it's no longer just

510
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,169
one connection to make here we're

511
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,470
talking about multiple connections I

512
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:53,620
have an edge device I may have five 10

513
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:55,540
tenants connected to my edge device each

514
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,929
attendant in to talk to their peers

515
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,850
right so from one edge supposedly if I

516
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,640
have just simply 10 no that's not

517
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:06,340
talking about 100 nodes Network 10 node

518
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,890
Network if I had to talk to connect with

519
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,770
all my dear so that means I have to have

520
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:14,830
9 connection to all my peers but if I

521
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:18,010
have 5 tenants attached each of them

522
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,860
need a cassette so that's 5 times 9 so

523
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:23,920
for one node today I have to support 45

524
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:28,060
peer-to-peer key management that's a lot

525
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:31,480
of work and in addition to that for SD

526
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:34,690
one or the device connecting to the

527
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,400
multiple cloud there's always always a

528
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,650
controller doesn't matter it's not just

529
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,370
for this particular purpose for other

530
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:44,440
purposes neither controller so as a

531
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,540
device today you already have a secure

532
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,090
connection with the controller through

533
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,100
that secure connection you can

534
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,550
distribute all those key informations

535
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,919
not directly key information per se but

536
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:59,500
rekey mechanism all those kind of

537
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,450
requires to rekey so that make the whole

538
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,550
network scalable otherwise just

539
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,580
unimaginable OneNote probably have to

540
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:09,909
handle hundreds of keys and that's just

541
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:14,350
not manageable by a small virtual device

542
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:16,180
especially I support this maybe this

543
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:20,320
exactly mechanism doesn't have to be the

544
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:23,110
one but it's controller paged IKEA has

545
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,360
to be in something to be discussed idea

546
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,709
so we have about a minute left per

547
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,679
person before needs to start wrapping

548
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,330
this up so please be breathing okay yeah

549
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,910
you have mirror culture effect Alyssa

550
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:38,139
this was presented in nitro NSF and I to

551
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:41,920
a surface has this document about using

552
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:44,440
a controller to initiate IPSec and you

553
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,990
have two modes or cases and one with I

554
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,780
can run without like a class installed

555
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,270
and we saw this is kind of a middle

556
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,060
ground and what I'm missing is what does

557
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:59,920
this give you that the I less that case

558
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:02,620
it does not give you so so in the I -

559
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,430
and it's a flow projection the eyeglass

560
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:09,489
case is simply having keys produced at

561
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:12,850
the controller and pushed down to the

562
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:15,820
ends so the controller now owns or knows

563
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:19,899
every key used in the network there's

564
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:22,750
certain obvious limitations to that sort

565
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,540
of model in the past I've spoken in I to

566
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,660
NSF about trying to integrate this into

567
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,340
that flow and since then this is

568
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,210
somewhat evolved with the routing groups

569
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:37,810
and the notion would be that I to NSF

570
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:41,380
would be used to configure the static

571
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:43,570
configuration for either an IKE or a

572
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,580
controller Ike but then the actual

573
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,399
dynamic messaging would happen through a

574
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:52,780
route reflector not through the I to NSF

575
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:55,030
yang model I think that's a much cleaner

576
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:59,410
design with what I to NSF has put

577
00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:03,100
forward but I don't see where we need

578
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,840
both that both this and that's too many

579
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,399
ways to get to the same thing so does

580
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:10,300
this need to be revisited in Knight to

581
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:14,200
NSF after developments yet

582
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:16,149
the document is pretty much done so not

583
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,600
with this document if somebody wants to

584
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:23,920
extend it later I can assess maybe the

585
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,980
home I so so the architecture that's

586
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:31,030
currently being put forward in best as

587
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:34,240
far as these dynamic routing models has

588
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:36,220
a configuration server that configures

589
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,830
nodes as they come online they need to

590
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,480
do some sort of ztp or something else to

591
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,610
connect to the network and they get a

592
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,650
configuration pushed but then there's

593
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,649
the dynamic routing where they send the

594
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:50,320
overlay routing to the RR and that would

595
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:55,540
be a more ideal place to send key

596
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,340
management updates yeah so I think

597
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,010
insert dispatch here and we're not like

598
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,449
building the protocol it sounds to me

599
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,150
like there's some confusion about the

600
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:07,180
actual requirements here maybe you put

601
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,770
people is by me and since designing

602
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,330
aches is kind of like difficult and

603
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,800
getting em right is not easy but they

604
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,379
could be really useful to get like a

605
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,270
somewhat clearer statement about how

606
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,440
this problem domain is sufficiently

607
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,820
different from other problems that means

608
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,400
that we can't lovers and they already

609
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,480
have and I think then exchange you and I

610
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,280
had earlier suggest to these I don't

611
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,980
understand this properly I'm telling my

612
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,440
fault but um so I think interest

613
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,790
dispatching this what we were helpful BJ

614
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,650
said we have a clear problem statements

615
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,909
that actually make clear like what this

616
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,800
use case how it's different and

617
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,150
potentially in ways that are more

618
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,500
constrained in a way in perhaps

619
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,700
bandwidth in ways that are less

620
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,520
constrained insurers have any controller

621
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,690
available right and then we can see what

622
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:49,720
protocol actually makes sense from a

623
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:51,870
super-intense asterick Union we hadn't

624
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,790
you know presentation of tha gave me

625
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,409
some time ago I remember and conclusion

626
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,720
was that we said that I need to do which

627
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,700
I paycheck so we don't want to do it the

628
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,560
night basic crew so if somebody

629
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,850
could propose that that's a solution to

630
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,139
that we are not going to take it like

631
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,540
this again me because this doesn't have

632
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,090
anything to check the other problem I

633
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,190
have disease is that it's assumes like

634
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,169
arrow saying you don't have really

635
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,350
requirements this assumes that your

636
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:19,060
whole network is stuck because they if

637
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,860
you have if you start building this

638
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,199
network one by one you have one node

639
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,750
that you add one node then even a dog

640
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,850
then

641
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,460
her unsecured okay because every time

642
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,810
you add a note you need to send that one

643
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,550
note sent a packet to controller

644
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,029
controller sent a packet to everybody to

645
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,820
tell us

646
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,399
oh that's happening you know public key

647
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,440
here and then somebody else it says

648
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:41,330
again so every time you set up notice

649
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,510
and end packets and you add in notes

650
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,730
it's n times in so into it so but your

651
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,490
if of course if you have everything

652
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,500
ready you have 10,000 notes there you

653
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,178
can send the 10,000 you know perfect

654
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,310
case at the same time and you know the

655
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:58,010
network starts the other problem I have

656
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:00,770
there is that you have to always you

657
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,570
know you know the benefits for Ike is

658
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,090
that you create the keys only when you

659
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,740
need if you have 10,000 nodes there you

660
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,990
don't have to trade in Harran SS when

661
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,029
you boot up you create only those it

662
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:14,689
says if you need it when you talk to

663
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:16,910
somebody and in most of the networks or

664
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,310
environments you don't need to talk to

665
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:22,069
everybody in the network every time all

666
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,890
the time you talk to you know handful of

667
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,740
people who are no next to you are all

668
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:29,180
discography so you have very you know

669
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:32,450
strict requirements that are not really

670
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:34,730
you know or or use case is very specific

671
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,740
this kind of you have static network

672
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,170
where everybody happens to talk to

673
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,779
everybody all the time and you create

674
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,570
the whole network in the beginning so

675
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,970
let me address both of those actually

676
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,710
this works really well in dynamic

677
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,470
networks when you start bringing nodes

678
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,830
online the node simply has to contact

679
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:56,450
one source the route reflector as it

680
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,819
were in there in the routing model and

681
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,859
update it with its diffie-hellman

682
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,890
information as well as the overlay

683
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:06,020
routes that it knows alright and the

684
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,879
overlay router is regularly sending

685
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,700
these updates to all the other routers

686
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,760
so it's it gets to them anyway he's not

687
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:16,870
adding to any load we had you know if

688
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,310
you have 99 nodes and you add one more

689
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:20,750
it's simply the next update from that

690
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:24,920
controller is going to have a hundred

691
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:26,990
entries instead of 99 it it done tends

692
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,780
to work really but that that still sent

693
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:32,180
a hundred messages 100 nodes

694
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,800
Bitsy's you know yes yes because because

695
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,750
you send periodic messages with Ike

696
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,900
doesn't you actually generating much

697
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,700
more traffic

698
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,109
because who sent every now and send you

699
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,049
have hundred messages to everybody

700
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:44,730
telling that they you know you were you

701
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:47,220
were sending the controller was sending

702
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,230
99 messages out anyway yeah it's the

703
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,788
latest status update here's the latest

704
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,529
update on the routes here's the latest

705
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:57,480
update on if you being at home in a

706
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:59,039
message sees your send over their

707
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,420
lifetime of the network I think that

708
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,609
actually is bigger than what they go to

709
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:11,220
what you do when you actually create the

710
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:13,170
ITSs Phil hamburger it strikes me that

711
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:17,490
this isn't so much a key exchange as a

712
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:21,029
message flow and I'm very interested in

713
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:24,118
this and here's why quantum resistance I

714
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:26,279
mean other moment but no solution for it

715
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,809
you know there are proposals but the

716
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:30,809
only thing that we could deploy today

717
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:32,730
will be Kerberos and this actually if

718
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:34,470
you look at the protocol level it's

719
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,200
looking pretty close to clear Kerberos

720
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:40,980
and so I think it's interesting to look

721
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,629
at as a fail-safe in the quantum

722
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,210
resistance world and so I'm interested

723
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,849
in that point of view as far as where it

724
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:53,039
gets dispatched to I'm pretty sure that

725
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:56,849
this is not an ad sponsored draft so I

726
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,739
think that it's a working group it

727
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:00,210
sounds like it's not IPSec so the

728
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:03,900
question is whether it's a working

729
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:06,029
report not anything at all so so just to

730
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,200
add real quick we've done you know a

731
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:10,230
bunch of thinking about quantum

732
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:15,239
resistance with this and if it needs

733
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:17,779
more work but yes when they cut the

734
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:22,109
lines here and again please be brief

735
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:23,789
Sunnis since you're doing a performance

736
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:26,970
optimization here I was wondering

737
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:30,089
whether you posted something about the

738
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,379
details of that performance improvements

739
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:33,089
because I was caught a little bit

740
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,059
confused on the discussions on the

741
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:39,420
scalability aspects which I didn't quite

742
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:42,269
see in like in the number of notes that

743
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:47,630
were mentioned I don't I would like to

744
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:47,629
see some of those details clarifying

745
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,540
he's doing a performance optimization

746
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,970
I'm maybe he has already written up

747
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,100
something about the details on the

748
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,040
performance gains that he expects to see

749
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,870
but I'm just not aware of those thank

750
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,640
you just from that mike is super hard to

751
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,640
hear up here okay for everyone

752
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:16,310
how many sensory I think there was a

753
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:19,040
misunderstanding by the other gentleman

754
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:21,230
who was here and talking about if you

755
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,450
add a note then you're gonna end up

756
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:27,140
sending tons of messages that's not the

757
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,640
case when you add a note that note talks

758
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,680
to the rot reflector which is the

759
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,350
controller and gets the information from

760
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:36,980
the controller so you're not sending any

761
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:39,490
other messages and the saving is on the

762
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:42,590
ingress notes or the note that you keep

763
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:51,799
adding to the network those can be a

764
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:55,160
very low power low low end notes that

765
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:59,300
don't have the you know the CPU capacity

766
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:02,930
of sending or n messages and in this

767
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,610
case we are just the note send a single

768
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,799
message to the controller and whoever

769
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:10,480
comes up taps of the controller and gets

770
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:19,970
that message and they get their public

771
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:25,010
keys and calculate the Cherokee dan yeah

772
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:27,049
thanks again Harkins so I noticed that

773
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,030
there's been some people coming in the

774
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,680
mic and talking to you about better ways

775
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,510
to do this you know Eric head of

776
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,710
suggesting territory isn't Alaska I'm

777
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,780
sorry I don't know your name

778
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,580
we're talking about you know different

779
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,200
ways to solve this problem or to do it

780
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,460
better or something else so it looks

781
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,390
like there's enough interest in this

782
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:46,190
kind of a problem and so I think when is

783
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,410
probably you know real soon now and

784
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:51,800
probably right now but I think we're I

785
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:54,200
don't see why I can't go into IPSec this

786
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,980
is no more of a weirdo key exchange them

787
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,500
like the G DOI stuff that we did so it's

788
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,730
it seems like if process is the reason

789
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,200
we wouldn't do this it seems like a

790
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:06,589
really

791
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,700
poor outcome for the ietf it looks like

792
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,779
there's enough interest and do something

793
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,078
like this looks like it solves a problem

794
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,790
so I mean let's put it in IPSec if we

795
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,549
got to change the Charter than let's

796
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,890
change the Charter it's so what well I

797
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:22,009
mean I would I would have to say you

798
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:24,200
know I don't want to disagree with the

799
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,809
IPSec can be working working group

800
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,058
chairs but to me this is an IPSec thing

801
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:32,119
yeah we're using the sole easy purpose

802
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:34,010
in just a second you know we're using

803
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,490
this solely for the purpose of wreaking

804
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:39,410
IPSec it's know it's providing a

805
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:43,399
function that I provides it's providing

806
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:47,299
a function that the GUI stuff did you

807
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:50,359
are using yes we're not using IPSec he

808
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:55,160
allows you to create ESP pockets if your

809
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:56,328
key he is as much of I can DC's yes you

810
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,670
can use multiple key management

811
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:02,240
protocols to create IPSec SI or from a

812
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:04,970
ESPs keying material an ESP no sponsors

813
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,979
but but that's not make it that doesn't

814
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,598
make it I basic and the people in the

815
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,390
IPSec can make group are interesting

816
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,920
IPSec which includes arc and they were

817
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,049
not interesting on this because they see

818
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,020
that they're only you know very small

819
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:19,400
piece of this is the ESP that is common

820
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,280
what they are going now

821
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,640
so as I said heap has his babies using

822
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,109
ESP it has exactly same common you know

823
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,049
understanding that this one I mean I

824
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:31,730
don't want to have a heap coming here

825
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:33,920
jido is actually using I person to

826
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,270
messaging between the you know peers and

827
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,069
it's actually using like person to frame

828
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,420
that's why it's much more concern that

829
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:40,730
there was lots of people who were saying

830
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,349
oh do we actually want to do that the

831
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,809
option was to have a separate you know

832
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:46,460
working group or or and we decided that

833
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:48,049
it still has some most of the same

834
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:54,819
people would be interested that's why

835
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:57,740
it's in there I wish I can make again

836
00:42:54,819 --> 00:43:01,040
since it's a dispatch group I think we

837
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:03,589
should first which consensus is of some

838
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,009
work we should do from istea perspective

839
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:10,430
and heard a comment about adding one new

840
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:14,059
node or trigger so many messages I just

841
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:16,330
want at one more point that in like for

842
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:19,540
example use SDI as an example

843
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:21,610
all the notes have to get controller to

844
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,529
dictate who we can communicate you

845
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:27,820
because we're talking about the overlay

846
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:30,430
Network I'm here in Montreal I have my

847
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,080
period in Dallas and I don't just talk

848
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,029
to Dallas maybe I'm not even allowed to

849
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,470
talk to him the controller has to

850
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,210
dictate who I talk to

851
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:40,089
so it makes more sense I have a

852
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:42,640
controller dictated I get controlled a

853
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:44,440
key so that they can send to the control

854
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,529
group but that's just one more

855
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:53,560
requirement that thing we should okay

856
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:58,780
thank you speak we're gonna try to wrap

857
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:02,770
up wraps up here yeah I mean so there's

858
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:04,990
I think still some lack of clarity among

859
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:07,990
many people in the audience part about

860
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:09,759
what the requirements are we heard some

861
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,310
talk in passing about the overlay

862
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,590
Network and maybe an implication that

863
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:16,150
the second is really bad and maybe the

864
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,770
implication that with overlay Network

865
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,710
you need to actually need to give every

866
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:22,960
node the key from every other node which

867
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,820
would get into some the scaling and

868
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,040
number of messages questions that were

869
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:31,300
raised so it's not really clear that the

870
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,770
people in the room have the information

871
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,140
that they need to make the dispatch

872
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,670
question maybe we should have more

873
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:40,060
discussion maybe we should have a

874
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:42,010
mailing list that we can do that or do

875
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,320
you want to keep it on sexist nuts yeah

876
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,460
yeah as you guys like and I think we

877
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,050
could have some discussion on psych

878
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,300
dispatch because it's still discussing

879
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,560
how to dispatch it or if you'd like a

880
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:57,100
new list or you can have a more focused

881
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:59,500
discussion more focus group I'm sure and

882
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,569
I'd say you've gotten a lot of good

883
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,750
feedback there's a really active

884
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:06,370
discussion so you know some of the

885
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,070
points that came out for revising their

886
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,779
requirements so that they were clear and

887
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:13,750
a revision of the draft would be helpful

888
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,870
if the ABS want it on a separate list

889
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:18,940
that of course is is an option or we

890
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:22,210
continue to leave it discussed on SEC

891
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:25,750
dispatch for a while until it's found at

892
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,430
home but it there's their interest I'm

893
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,430
comfortable leaving it on SEC dispatch

894
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:30,640
unless there's a desire to have a view

895
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,649
[Music]

896
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,230
okay so nothing for now except revised

897
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:38,359
and defined requirements more clearly

898
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:43,720
right and then we see you figure out

899
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:43,720
next steps okay thank you thank you oh

900
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:57,950
I'm Tom Baker I'm here to present on the

901
00:45:53,630 --> 00:46:00,440
mathematical mesh so internet security

902
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:03,609
is broken it's broken because we keep

903
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,950
being told it's broken in the news and

904
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:09,470
if you look at what we do here we use

905
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:13,460
very little cryptography that isn't

906
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,990
described in Bruce Schneier blue book we

907
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,640
don't use anything from the red book

908
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,680
we've improved some of our algorithms

909
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,058
but we're still approaching the problems

910
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:25,399
in the same way the things like s/mime

911
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:27,530
open PGP the user spending too much

912
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,380
effort they're not using them and

913
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:33,079
they're not going to change so we've got

914
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:36,680
to change our approach and if you look

915
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:40,670
at the problems out there most of the

916
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:43,879
breaches of a data at rest and we focus

917
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:46,339
on transport we've got to look at the

918
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,460
data at rest problem as well because

919
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:51,470
that's where the breaches are the

920
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,230
approach that I want to approach apply

921
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:58,669
here is meta cryptography I want to go

922
00:46:54,230 --> 00:47:01,490
beyond the PGP Canon and one key

923
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:04,849
cryptography des allows you to solve a

924
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:09,020
lot of problems you know ATM systems

925
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:11,480
were made possible by debts however two

926
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,299
key cryptography allows you to do more

927
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,829
because you can separate out the roles

928
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:18,290
when encryption and decryption of

929
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:20,990
different keys different people can do

930
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:27,640
it so if one key cryptography is good

931
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:33,290
and two keys are better why don't we try

932
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:36,828
yeah so it's about moving towards more

933
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:39,529
keys more separation of roles more

934
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:41,569
separation of duties and this allows you

935
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,860
to do some really cool stuff like have a

936
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:45,830
cloud service

937
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,470
that with all the encrypted data but can

938
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:51,470
encrypt stuff but doesn't have the

939
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:54,319
ability to decrypt because it doesn't

940
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:58,459
have any other it's the key manager it

941
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:00,440
doesn't have acne actual keys so the

942
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,000
solution I've come up with for this is

943
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,030
more than just an application it's

944
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,590
really a platform and when you look at

945
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:09,410
what you need to support this and make

946
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:11,570
it usable by end-users you need to do

947
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:15,080
three basic things you need to be able

948
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:19,280
to join together that all their devices

949
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:22,310
into one Gestalt so that they can read

950
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,010
the word document read the Excel

951
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:27,440
spreadsheet read their email on any one

952
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:32,540
of them now people aren't going to use

953
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,550
PGP if you can't read your email on

954
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,460
every one of your devices you currently

955
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:40,340
do so you don't have a way of doing that

956
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:43,280
key portability you have to have a way

957
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:45,770
of establishing trusted relationship

958
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,930
with other users and you have to have a

959
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,280
secure control plane messaging to

960
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:51,500
support all of the above

961
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,270
and the thing is that when you've got

962
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,390
all that infrastructure to support this

963
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:59,330
one application well you can use it to

964
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:01,129
secure almost everything else or to make

965
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:03,710
the use of anything else

966
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:06,650
easy when I show this to Dave Clark he

967
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:10,250
said well SSH can you do something about

968
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:12,650
making SSH easy to use because thing

969
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:16,130
about SSH is ok it's not that difficult

970
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:18,950
to use however if you make a mistake in

971
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:24,290
the wrong time somebody's got to get on

972
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:26,660
a plane to fix it and I've done that so

973
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,880
I've designed it in such a way that you

974
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,649
can reuse this thing in other stuff and

975
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,380
it's designed with the deployment

976
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:36,080
strategy that even though this cloud

977
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,970
computing multi key cryptography is

978
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,560
where I want to end up that that's not

979
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,080
the first application I'm looking to

980
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,210
sell it as the bunch of technology out

981
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,299
there I'm going to go through a summary

982
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:50,150
of just a few of them but there's more

983
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,580
technology there and it can be used and

984
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:55,850
it's all MIT license is all unencumbered

985
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:56,660
as far as I'm aware it should be good to

986
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:59,480
go

987
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:02,149
so one of those technologies is PGP

988
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:06,040
fingerprints revisited allow us to

989
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:11,420
represent any output not just an md5 as

990
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:13,759
a base 32 encrypted screen and apply

991
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,550
this to content digests to nonces

992
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:20,060
encryption secrets

993
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:24,440
Jameer secret sharing h max allow you to

994
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:26,540
present that data in the same syntax now

995
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,490
you're asking why aren't these URIs well

996
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,100
they're not you are eyes themselves but

997
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:32,720
you can put them in any URI and here's

998
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,420
what you can get from you putting it in

999
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:40,759
you your I so we have here an encryption

1000
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:45,380
key and we've added to it a domain okay

1001
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:48,020
so that is a u RN with a domain it can't

1002
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,930
be resolved by a regular browser but if

1003
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:53,930
you take the fingerprint the content

1004
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:56,990
digest of the encryption key and you

1005
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:59,359
slap the well-known service on top now

1006
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:02,680
we've got a locator we can pull an

1007
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:07,310
encrypted document and then use that

1008
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:11,319
encryption secret to decrypt it okay so

1009
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:14,320
now we've got a URI that allows you to D

1010
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:18,350
retrieve and decrypt the information

1011
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:20,690
let's just that as a QR code and now you

1012
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:25,940
can put something on your business card

1013
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:30,020
that links to a PGP fingerprint that's

1014
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:32,150
actually actionable locatable and so i

1015
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:36,770
use this type of technology to connect

1016
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:41,150
devices to a personal mesh or contacts

1017
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:44,480
to a mesh account and you could also use

1018
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:48,140
it though on applications like put a QR

1019
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:51,830
code on an invoice or a bill or your tax

1020
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:54,529
return links to electronic copy there

1021
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:57,440
off and all that data in the cloud is

1022
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:02,720
all encrypted so even if the crowd is

1023
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,370
breached the data isn't one of the

1024
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,089
technologies is the replacement for

1025
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:10,400
pkcs7 now this wouldn't be essential in

1026
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,710
itself but the reason that I needed to

1027
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,390
fill

1028
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,849
with it was because I wanted to do the

1029
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:17,190
multi key cryptography stuff and bowtie

1030
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:20,970
and finish there wasn't much pkcs7 left

1031
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:22,530
and so I get rid of the legacy and I

1032
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:24,950
designed it so that you can stack

1033
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:27,570
envelopes together to make a container

1034
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:30,720
so you can now do blockchain type

1035
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:32,550
integrity checks you can create a Merkel

1036
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,879
tree as you add your envelopes the

1037
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:37,980
container take the envelope out give it

1038
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,950
to somebody check the signature on it

1039
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:44,099
and now you've got one signature check

1040
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:47,759
one signature on the container can

1041
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:50,970
authenticate any message so it's a way

1042
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,910
of doing incremental authentication you

1043
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,890
can also do incremental encryption so

1044
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:59,060
one key exchange at the start of the log

1045
00:52:55,890 --> 00:53:02,279
file can be used to encrypt a subsequent

1046
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:06,240
entry and these are all flexible you

1047
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,580
know their options not requirements so

1048
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,098
what can we do to create applications

1049
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:13,680
out of there well in the mesh I use

1050
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:16,050
these to support my mesh accounts mesh

1051
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,720
accounts belong to the user not a

1052
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:20,640
service so when you go and you start up

1053
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,919
the mesh you create accounts for

1054
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,890
yourself and then you decide whether you

1055
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,320
want Google or Microsoft or whoever to

1056
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:30,990
support them and you want to change you

1057
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,480
can because they're designed to be low

1058
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:36,990
switching costs we could use the same

1059
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,420
exact technology for your server logs so

1060
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:41,368
that you can get to GDP our compliance

1061
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,740
or rather make it cheaper to get to

1062
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:45,570
certain types of GDP our compliance

1063
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,149
where you're trying to make sure that

1064
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:54,000
you know exactly who is reading your

1065
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:56,609
server logs and who is analyzing them so

1066
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:02,580
what I'm trying to do here this is

1067
00:53:56,609 --> 00:54:05,098
almost zero trust cryptography but not

1068
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:08,009
quite I'm trying to distrust each party

1069
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:12,060
as much as possible by separation of

1070
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:14,280
roles so if I buy a piece of equipment I

1071
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:17,670
attached it to I mmm mesh I don't want

1072
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,940
to trust any key that the manufacturer

1073
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:23,580
has put in there during manufacture but

1074
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,510
I certainly want to make the use of such

1075
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,660
a key

1076
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:30,090
in particular if it's put in there

1077
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,910
during manufacture in such a way that it

1078
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:35,610
can't ever come out and so I use the

1079
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:37,770
same meta cryptographic techniques that

1080
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:40,050
allow me to split keys

1081
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:42,240
to combine them and this is all

1082
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,890
technology that Matt Blais table and

1083
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,549
medicine and others developed in the

1084
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:50,549
1990s and didn't get used because it

1085
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:53,630
wasn't part of the PGP Canon and so it's

1086
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:58,800
about moving forward beyond that kind to

1087
00:54:53,630 --> 00:55:01,620
do something else so as I mentioned I

1088
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:05,070
have a messaging plane here now the idea

1089
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:08,069
here is not to replace smtp well not

1090
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:11,040
immediately but to have a mechanism that

1091
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:13,530
is limited to sending control messages

1092
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,230
that is guaranteed to be end-to-end

1093
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:19,340
secure this is guaranteed to provide

1094
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:23,750
certain traffic analysis resistance

1095
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:26,640
capabilities and is also abuse resistant

1096
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:29,850
every message that is sent as a message

1097
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:33,870
is access controlled at the sending

1098
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:36,930
service and the receiving service so it

1099
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:38,609
doesn't prevent spam absolutely but it

1100
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:42,779
makes it very difficult to make a profit

1101
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:45,510
sending spam now I apply this to manage

1102
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:47,820
that secure contact exchange to manage

1103
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:49,800
the connection of devices to a personal

1104
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:54,230
mesh but it can also be used for other

1105
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:56,280
things yeah 50 line application is

1106
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:59,190
provides us with two-factor

1107
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,490
authentication a few more lines allows

1108
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:04,980
us to go beyond two-factor so say I want

1109
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:08,310
to add somebody you know say I'm adding

1110
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,410
some payee to my bank account my bank

1111
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:13,740
could send me a message to say do you

1112
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:16,350
really want to use to add this person to

1113
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:20,160
the account yes or no I can say yes and

1114
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,990
that goes a signed statement that is a

1115
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,170
second factor authentication because

1116
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:28,580
it's bound to the device but it's also

1117
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:31,440
bound to the semantics of the

1118
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:33,420
transaction that are actually accepted

1119
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,700
which is something you don't get with

1120
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,660
the numeric code second factor

1121
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:42,430
authentication

1122
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:45,710
so I've given you a brief and you know

1123
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,328
we'll win tour of a bunch of Technology

1124
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:49,160
and I hope that it's not being too

1125
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:51,230
insensible but the question that I've

1126
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,250
now got is where do we go from here

1127
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:58,369
yeah and releasing this stuff there's

1128
00:56:55,250 --> 00:57:01,099
already the Alpha is out there on github

1129
00:56:58,369 --> 00:57:03,170
and I need to start releasing this in

1130
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:04,880
the fall because that's when

1131
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,430
universities start and that's when

1132
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,960
undergrads and graduate students start

1133
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:14,419
looking for projects and so I want to

1134
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,670
get this and you know I want this to

1135
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:18,500
become a standard somewhere the ITF

1136
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:20,869
looks like it's probably the best fit it

1137
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,009
may not be you know if the ITF doesn't

1138
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:24,230
want it I'll have to take it somewhere

1139
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:26,660
else so the question is you know is this

1140
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:29,299
ready for ITF work you know do we need

1141
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:31,490
to look at it as an RTF thing first

1142
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:33,619
if should we start the working group you

1143
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:37,490
know should we do it as experimental or

1144
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:39,950
whatever but you know I'm coming here

1145
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,558
now because I'm gonna start deploying

1146
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:44,930
and the minute that I start to get users

1147
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,789
I'm going to be protecting those users

1148
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:49,220
I'm not going to be wanting to make

1149
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:53,059
changes that might introduce backwards

1150
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:55,519
compatibility so well unless there's a

1151
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:58,460
real value to doing it so you know speak

1152
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:05,058
now or hold your peace yeah so that's it

1153
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:08,230
so comments people's on us all I have

1154
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:10,759
two questions first question is IP our

1155
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:13,039
second question is how does this fit

1156
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:15,920
with existing security protocols who

1157
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:22,309
pretty much assumes the one or two key

1158
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:25,460
model okay so on IP are there is no IP

1159
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:29,059
are on any of the stuff that represented

1160
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:32,569
today that I'm aware of

1161
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:37,039
I'm aware of prior art that would

1162
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:40,390
invalidate most claims that go back for

1163
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,980
to the 1990s as I said this was the

1164
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:45,200
basic techniques were developed by Matt

1165
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:47,210
glaze table and pedis and others

1166
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:50,779
this is threshold cryptography there's a

1167
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:52,779
fairly well-established literature so

1168
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:56,569
I don't believe that there's an IPR

1169
00:58:52,779 --> 00:59:00,109
blocking issue there or my code is MIT

1170
00:58:56,569 --> 00:59:05,209
license so it's open source in the most

1171
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:07,689
open source license now as far as

1172
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:11,919
integrating with two key cryptography

1173
00:59:07,689 --> 00:59:17,299
now you can use the mesh to distribute

1174
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:21,229
private key pairs to two devices views

1175
00:59:17,299 --> 00:59:23,719
with s/mime or with PGP or anything else

1176
00:59:21,229 --> 00:59:26,209
the only restriction that you have there

1177
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:28,159
is that you would have to be using if

1178
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:30,618
you're going to make use but if you just

1179
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:33,559
want to distribute RSA keys you can if

1180
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:37,939
you wanted to use make use of the freaky

1181
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:41,900
stuff within PGP we could extend PGP or

1182
00:59:37,939 --> 00:59:43,519
s/mime to make use of it however you

1183
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,669
would then have to use elliptic curve

1184
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:49,189
diffie-hellman or find some other

1185
00:59:46,669 --> 00:59:51,469
threshold cryptography scheme the

1186
00:59:49,189 --> 00:59:54,979
threshold cryptography schemes I use

1187
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:58,309
they're currently using IDI for 48 the

1188
00:59:54,979 --> 01:00:01,999
CFR G curve and I'm using that for

1189
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:05,150
signature and encryption I can use curve

1190
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:07,788
X as what instead but because it's

1191
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:10,729
Montgomery I have to write a different

1192
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:13,880
set of code I didn't want to do that for

1193
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:17,178
expedience reviews I can take offline so

1194
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:19,759
you killed use this with open PGP you

1195
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:25,130
don't change encryption at all the only

1196
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:28,159
thing that changes is decription alright

1197
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:34,640
Thompson thanks for bringing this here

1198
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:39,289
this is really huge and that is kind of

1199
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:41,538
what I'm trying to get to and if in my

1200
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:45,409
opinion at least if the ITF it takes on

1201
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:48,319
work of this nature it's kind of a major

1202
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:52,130
project in the sense that WebRTC was a

1203
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:54,739
major project or sip was a major project

1204
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:57,229
or something along those lines so I

1205
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:59,539
would suggest at a minimum this requires

1206
01:00:57,229 --> 01:01:02,430
above and it's good that you bring it

1207
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:05,710
here and having the discussions

1208
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:08,020
but it also suggests that if you say

1209
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:10,810
you're not willing to change your your

1210
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:11,980
code there might be a problem because

1211
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,759
there's going to take a little while to

1212
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:18,160
get this thing working

1213
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:19,870
oh absolutely I'm absolutely willing you

1214
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,690
know if somebody will come to me and say

1215
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:24,609
we need to change that or whatever I'm

1216
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:28,030
perfectly willing to do that

1217
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:32,200
however if somebody came to me today and

1218
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:34,390
said hey Phil I read your drafts and you

1219
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,569
know if you just changed this or you did

1220
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:41,710
this this way yeah I could make radical

1221
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:46,030
changes under the hood and the cost of

1222
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:48,370
that would be zero if however we go down

1223
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:52,210
the line and it's kind of like people

1224
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:54,520
you know did you yeah so I'm just saying

1225
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:57,070
you know please don't wait until people

1226
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:01,150
have started to adopt it to read the

1227
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:05,250
drafts and then come and say oh but you

1228
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:08,650
need to do it in sn1 it's kind of like

1229
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:11,380
yep so I'm absolutely happy to make

1230
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:13,050
changes you know I mean at the moment

1231
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:16,480
you know this is kind of like the

1232
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:20,230
autistic world according to Phil yeah

1233
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:24,250
I'm aware of that and I am I want to

1234
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:27,250
have as much input as possible I'm just

1235
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,450
I do have a question for you um how many

1236
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:31,750
other implementers do you have

1237
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:34,750
interested in at the moment to have no

1238
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:38,350
implementers but you know I'm coming

1239
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:40,000
here to say you know I mean one of the

1240
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,319
requirements for a buff is that people

1241
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:47,620
have to have seen it which is why I'm

1242
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:49,480
presenting here before yeah um thanks

1243
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:52,660
for presenting this um budgeting stuff

1244
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,280
here um I guess I was sort of seeing

1245
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:57,460
something same things Martin was asking

1246
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,110
I guess this would be a little easier

1247
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:01,000
for you to assimilate if it weren't all

1248
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,530
one monolithic thing I understand that I

1249
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,910
understand you think of this components

1250
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:09,520
but it's hard for me to reason about it

1251
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:12,430
that way so you're realistically we're

1252
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,800
not gonna replace SSH however much one

1253
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,950
might not like it and realistic

1254
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,540
I mean realistic we had this since

1255
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:20,180
normos installed base of like of like

1256
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,740
things right and my experience I'm sure

1257
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:23,770
yours has been is that you know those

1258
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:26,598
things don't don't die easily so

1259
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:30,670
absolutely this is not about replacing

1260
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:33,020
SSH but what you could use here is

1261
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:36,380
instead of use it I mean the problem

1262
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:38,930
with SSH from my point of view is people

1263
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,820
use it but they don't necessarily use it

1264
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:43,730
securely and if you look at some of the

1265
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:45,530
guides for how to secure SSH that are

1266
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:48,980
out there on the web I mean it's like

1267
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:51,530
mail yourself the private key so that

1268
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:54,680
you can have it on your devices and it's

1269
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:58,550
kind of like so you but you could use it

1270
01:03:54,680 --> 01:04:01,098
for is to distribute the SSH keys so

1271
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:04,070
then you can use them it's got backwards

1272
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:05,900
compatibility it's just that I could

1273
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:08,450
have used instead of the Dare envelope I

1274
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:10,790
could have used pkcs7 I could have used

1275
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:13,310
their said Wan I did Jason and that type

1276
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:14,450
of stuff sure yeah I guess so what make

1277
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:17,299
me me it easier at least for me to

1278
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:19,009
understand situation um I mean I think I

1279
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,210
understand the threat hold stuff like

1280
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:21,619
poison we weld but we can either

1281
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:23,060
understand your vision I think if I

1282
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:25,310
understand how it fit in with the things

1283
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:30,500
like sort of committed to later or not

1284
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:32,810
yeah honest pill on the mailing list you

1285
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,599
said that you believe that this was also

1286
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:36,920
applicability to the IOD environment

1287
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,930
that I was curious on whether you could

1288
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:43,790
have elaborate on that a little bit to

1289
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:48,799
the what the Internet of Things right so

1290
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:50,810
yes so I could one of the things that

1291
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,970
the reason I think that Alice needs some

1292
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:54,380
wit Mayo

1293
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:56,779
connecting all the devices to something

1294
01:04:54,380 --> 01:05:00,470
that she controls is that right now I

1295
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:02,000
have an enormous number of IOT devices

1296
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:06,020
I'll be talking about this on my

1297
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:11,859
Thursday rant on the Pecha Kucha session

1298
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:11,859
so I've got about don't tell the wife

1299
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:20,930
okay so I have an incredible amount of

1300
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:25,130
IOT stuff and I have an enormous amount

1301
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:28,009
of accounts with services to manage them

1302
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:29,510
and because of that I don't have an

1303
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:32,060
Internet of Things

1304
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:35,480
none of my devices will talk to each

1305
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:38,410
other and it's got worse not better you

1306
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,150
know I have all these nest devices and

1307
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:43,819
they used to talk and now they're not

1308
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:47,570
going to talk and so what we can do with

1309
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:49,820
the so if every device has a set of keys

1310
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:51,830
for encryption or authentication and

1311
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:55,490
signature that are layered into the

1312
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:58,190
device when they join my mesh then they

1313
01:05:55,490 --> 01:06:01,069
can talk to coordination you know

1314
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:03,440
dashboards that I control and I can get

1315
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:06,440
to the point you know what I want to do

1316
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:11,000
is to drive up to the house and for the

1317
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:16,609
doors to open the lights to go on and so

1318
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:18,590
I need that intervention scripting but

1319
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:20,840
right now I can't have it and we can't

1320
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:24,830
have it because the model that everybody

1321
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:27,650
has is you can the device connects up to

1322
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:33,170
the service in the cloud to an account

1323
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:36,230
run by the IOT device provider and then

1324
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:39,050
my hub in my house connects up to that

1325
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:44,750
hub and then when the Internet's out my

1326
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:46,390
house is offline so in the IOT world

1327
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:49,369
this is a way that you can avoid

1328
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:53,569
depending upon that service and a way

1329
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:56,300
that we can get from this current not an

1330
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:58,100
internet of things things that just

1331
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,710
happen to have Ethernet or Wi-Fi or

1332
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:04,730
Bluetooth but aren't internet because

1333
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:06,200
they won't work with each other and the

1334
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,990
thing is that it will be easier and

1335
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:12,910
cheaper for you to use my stuff as it

1336
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:15,430
from toolkit than to invent it yourself

1337
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:17,660
Thanks

1338
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:19,520
hi Sean Turner

1339
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:22,310
hey Phil I think you've been doing this

1340
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,020
for maybe longer than I have so I would

1341
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,279
say that based on your pitch right now I

1342
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,200
would say that this work is not

1343
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,280
applicable to the IHF because it didn't

1344
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,379
really sound like you were willing to

1345
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,790
take changes if you this work gets

1346
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,200
adopted by the IETF

1347
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:34,970
you might not even be the author of the

1348
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,689
working group drafts if there was a

1349
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:38,330
working group

1350
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:40,250
so whatever the working group consensus

1351
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:42,859
would be to change it we change it so

1352
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,600
maybe you just misspoke but I just want

1353
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:45,700
to make it clear

1354
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:50,230
like you do understand that if this were

1355
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:52,270
to happen oh absolutely uh you know

1356
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:56,370
there's two types of changes that happen

1357
01:07:52,270 --> 01:08:01,420
here right one of them is somebody says

1358
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:02,970
okay we want to do this functionality we

1359
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:05,500
want to add that yeah that stuff

1360
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:08,500
perfectly fine if suddenly comes to me

1361
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:15,730
and say oh that's great but I want you

1362
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:16,960
to do it all in sn1 an email you though

1363
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:18,279
that's the problem the rights of the

1364
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,260
working group consensus is we want to

1365
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:22,990
come up with some new encoding scheme

1366
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:24,730
and call it unki Squa sn2 or whatever

1367
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:26,710
like that's just the way it will of the

1368
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:28,179
working group yeah I guess I guess if

1369
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:31,029
you understand that that's ok and I

1370
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:32,140
think everyone here does yeah I mean if

1371
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:33,819
there's a group of people who are

1372
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:36,700
willing to do it and implement and

1373
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:39,160
deploy I mean like yeah but you know if

1374
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:42,069
it's kind of like right the point is

1375
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:44,080
that right now if you had some idea that

1376
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:47,469
you you think would radically improve

1377
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:51,130
the functionality and there was no other

1378
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:52,740
reason rather than your personal I could

1379
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:54,310
do it I mean we all know that the

1380
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:55,899
standardization process sometimes

1381
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:58,359
introduces silly chains that we don't

1382
01:08:55,899 --> 01:09:00,160
understand or don't like like at the end

1383
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:01,180
we had one thing that was a bit string

1384
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,099
and it was like please change to a

1385
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:04,630
boolean I mean like sometimes things

1386
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:07,350
things gotta happen but you kind of got

1387
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:09,460
to do it if that's the consensus oh yeah

1388
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:11,080
it's basically like the same with

1389
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:13,840
security requirements where we ask

1390
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:15,819
people to read the drafts early rather

1391
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:18,100
than late I'm just making that point

1392
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:20,889
that you know please read the stuff now

1393
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:23,980
don't wait for two years for me to have

1394
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:25,720
users and then for me to say yeah that

1395
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:30,009
would be a really good idea for us to do

1396
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:34,650
then but you know oh you know legacy

1397
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:34,650
deployments great but it's also a tract

1398
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:41,800
rich sauce yes both ways so part of me

1399
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:43,750
feels like this is sort of like

1400
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,340
contributing to global warming because

1401
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:48,550
the oceans are getting all boiled away

1402
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:50,859
and maybe if there were a simpler

1403
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:53,529
smaller piece that could be split off

1404
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:55,780
and it seems that potentially the UDF

1405
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:58,389
stuff because I know other groups have

1406
01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:00,790
wrestled with naming key

1407
01:09:58,389 --> 01:10:03,489
openpgp i think was the last one the guy

1408
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:07,600
trying to do it um so i recommend

1409
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:11,049
pulling that work out skipping the fact

1410
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,840
that it's got 75 possible use cases and

1411
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:16,840
it's the solution to world hunger and

1412
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:21,900
just address it's a way to distribute a

1413
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:24,880
name keys that is no web compatible oh

1414
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:27,429
yeah i mean that would make great sense

1415
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:32,290
and the fingerprint piece could actually

1416
01:10:27,429 --> 01:10:34,210
be pulled out as a separate unit the

1417
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:36,880
other stuff kind of depends upon the

1418
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:46,480
fingerprints as a fundamental

1419
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:49,030
infrastructure so I would take this

1420
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,400
single presented as an iw conference

1421
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:53,800
actually and talk to the self sovereign

1422
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:57,009
people I think you'd have a lot in

1423
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:59,469
common with them and there is a at least

1424
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:01,090
conceptually there is there seems to be

1425
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:04,630
some overlap with what they try to do

1426
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:11,710
I'm not advocating that stuff myself but

1427
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:13,449
I think well in humane a little bit

1428
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:15,670
maybe but I would actually go talk to

1429
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:16,178
this out so learn identity people they I

1430
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:19,420
think

1431
01:11:16,179 --> 01:11:22,210
let's I'm not touching the word self

1432
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:24,820
sovereign identity go go go for self

1433
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:26,800
sovereign identity you look at the stuff

1434
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:29,679
that they talk about it it looks a lot

1435
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:34,239
like this they they're trying to address

1436
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:35,920
sort of the same problems again and

1437
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,559
again I I don't

1438
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,210
I personally run with that crowd sigh I

1439
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,980
couldn't tell you more about the details

1440
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:45,550
but I do know that they meet at this

1441
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:47,440
conference cycle in in Silicon Valley

1442
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:50,260
called the internet identity workshop

1443
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:52,690
and I think that in that slide the

1444
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:55,060
answer to the question of where go talk

1445
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:58,599
to them first I think before you know

1446
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:00,389
deciding this needs to be in ITF this

1447
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:05,619
needs to be in the idea

1448
01:12:00,389 --> 01:12:07,420
thanks Brett Jordan I really like this

1449
01:12:05,619 --> 01:12:08,799
thank you for doing this work I think

1450
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,720
it's really great I'd love to work with

1451
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,220
you on it whether it's here whether

1452
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,440
somewhere whether it's on the moon I

1453
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,880
don't care I think there's some really

1454
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,790
neat things that could solve a lot of

1455
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,910
problems so thank you for doing the work

1456
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:20,910
thank you

1457
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:33,280
hi so personally thank you for bringing

1458
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,380
this kind of here kind of chatting with

1459
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,690
that and listen the community I think

1460
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,949
that folks have poked at interesting

1461
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:41,079
parts of exactly what you're suggesting

1462
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:42,969
I think that there were tactical

1463
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:44,558
suggestions in terms of responding about

1464
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:46,659
kind of scope what about this what about

1465
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:48,909
that but I think the overriding thing

1466
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:51,638
that resonates for us is this is a big

1467
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:53,289
thing there is no way we can move we can

1468
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:54,610
move forward with something of you know

1469
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:56,320
the full scope we were even a narrow

1470
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:59,679
scope without a bomb so we would

1471
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:03,099
strongly encourage you to oh yeah I mean

1472
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:06,010
I anticipated that I know one of the

1473
01:13:03,099 --> 01:13:07,809
things I am trying to grip the reason I

1474
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:09,880
brought it here was that the

1475
01:13:07,809 --> 01:13:12,010
precondition for having a buff has to be

1476
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,960
that there's in the right people at the

1477
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:16,690
buff and that they've actually looked at

1478
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:19,239
the technology beforehand so I didn't

1479
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:21,579
want to a soar above here because if I

1480
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:24,218
did you know then you know nobody would

1481
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:28,599
know about the work so you know I'm very

1482
01:13:24,219 --> 01:13:31,179
happy going forward with a buff I if

1483
01:13:28,599 --> 01:13:33,489
people have you know my current research

1484
01:13:31,179 --> 01:13:36,909
concern on it is working out how to

1485
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:38,739
scale because at the moment I've I've

1486
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:42,518
gone run the numbers I can run a million

1487
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:44,259
users but this is targeting a billion so

1488
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:47,889
if people could help me on that right

1489
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:50,889
now I'd be very grateful but yeah I mean

1490
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:53,679
a boss would that would be my preferred

1491
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:56,289
way ahead so a quick question while

1492
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,749
you're at the mic since the next step

1493
01:13:56,289 --> 01:14:00,579
for this could be a bath should we set

1494
01:13:58,749 --> 01:14:02,920
up a separate mailing list specific to

1495
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:04,268
this work to track it I think I would

1496
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:08,019
make sense if you're up for that

1497
01:14:04,269 --> 01:14:10,300
absolutely yes I've been very going back

1498
01:14:08,019 --> 01:14:12,579
to the IPR piece I've been very careful

1499
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:17,440
to only discuss this on less that have a

1500
01:14:12,579 --> 01:14:20,880
note well equivalents and so I want to

1501
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:22,449
make sure that we maintain the IPR

1502
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,869
situation thank you

1503
01:14:22,449 --> 01:14:29,678
great so mailing lists and stuff thank

1504
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:32,139

1505

01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:37,690

wants to talk about it afterwards meet

1508

along thank you so from the first the

1512

01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:57,700
we would dispatch it to lamps for the

1514
01:14:54,550 --> 01:15:00,430
controller Ike the go forward there was

1515

to specify requirements revise the draft

1516
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:06,100

1520
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:18,220
go forward is this needs a buff it's a

1521
