13
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:14,780
the one time I tried to mess with that I

14

from the RFC editor and all the segments

57
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:41,830
routing drafts are are that it we're

58
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,719
waiting on miss references are going to

59
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,250
be published very soon I was hoping it

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,800
would be before this meeting but it's

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:57,430
not so well that'll be good to get these

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:59,620

65
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:12,250
uh trying to get the offers the primary

66
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,919
offers to finish the response there was

67
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,490
some confusion about Alvaro's comments

68
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:22,599
not that's pending the yang data model

69
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:25,510
for OSPF protocol we finished the 80

70
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:27,599
comments we've had a ATF wide working

71
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,010
with last call there's been some

72
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:33,010
comments on a few more comments on the

73
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:38,590
list and a few more Directorate reviews

74
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:41,440
we were we had a we've had multiple yang

75
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,330
doctor reviews and luckily the last one

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,070
we didn't hit anything new but we had

77
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,599
we've had some other reviews and there

78
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,460
so there's some minor comments and

79
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:53,020
things to answer before it goes to the

80
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:57,210
iesg restart singling that's just

81
00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:00,270
recently been we just recently work

82
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:05,969
requested publication so awaiting ad

83
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:09,210
comments and this one this cross address

84
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,419
family traffic engineering since Alvaro

85
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,580
is one of the primary offers when a co

86
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,889
offers Martin is taking on a eighty

87
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,198
review and it's and that has also gotten

88
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:23,820
through most of the Directorate reviews

89
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,590
we have completed working group last

90
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,440
call on these we have to write up the

91
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:33,479
Shepards reports the two and yeah let me

92
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,280
say one more thing about these so these

93
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,800
documents is you know we spend a lot of

94
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,388
time in past years and so we gotta

95
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,729
capture that discussion in summary and

96
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:49,560
the Shepards reports and send it to the

97
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:54,090
80s baby finally I'll let you talked

98
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:58,440
about this one yeah so we had we had a

99
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,448
process fubar snafu whatever on the yang

100
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,960
model for is is a I think if you

101
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:07,770
remember a meeting or two ago we decided

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,359
to do like OSPF first and then get the

103
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,430
comments capture the comments and make

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,409
adjustments to the eye size but then

105
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,570
that sort of got the signals got crossed

106
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:17,820
on that I don't know where where exactly

107
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,930
those signals got crossed I might have

108
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,050
been at eighty level might have been at

109
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,340
working bubble so the AC of thinking

110
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,330
that we had done a working group last

111
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,159
column both submitted the is is but we

112
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,159
have process wise we have not actually

113
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:35,639
working group last called the ISI yang

114
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:40,020
model so we are currently receiving 80

115
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,870
reviews on the is I see a model for

116
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,560
processes sake we will be well working

117
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:49,320
group last calling this document as well

118
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,210
starting like today so this is first

119
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,690
notice of the working group last call on

120
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,948
the is is yang model will do a note to

121
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,259
the list

122
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,220
you know also sort of saying hey we've

123
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,080
got this backwards but other than that

124
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,180
this has been around for a long time I

125
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,650
don't think that we are going to get in

126
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,490
too much trouble for having reverse the

127
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:15,299
order on this

128
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:18,389
this time okay we got both of these

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,849
entropy label capability drafts we

130
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:26,340
revised these to advertise per prefix

131
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:28,650
capability and uh thanks to Peter and I

132
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,130
did the OSPF I I don't know if he did

133
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,490
the eius eius too but they're both they

134
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,659
both reflect what or if Stefan did did

135
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,130
one of them I don't remember yes

136
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,529
definite one a Peter did one and now

137
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,689
we're ready to working group last call

138
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:46,470
them the one thing we do know do need

139
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:49,260
our BG pls code points and rather than

140
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,970
having a separate IDR draft we just just

141
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,760
before this meeting I had some

142
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,070
discussions with Kenton and he has

143
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,550
agreed to add that to one of these

144
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,540
drafts

145
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,339
it will probably be OSPF because he

146
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,319
works everyday with Peter and it'd be

147
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,660
just easier to do the same

148
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,080
of course definitely working with us to

149
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,589
pretty soon so anyway but so we should

150
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,850
get those soon to working with last call

151
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:19,320
next one we're gonna cover these what

152
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:25,760
the flex algorithm it's gonna be covered

153
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:28,500
today same with these yang models and

154
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,220
these ones are let's see everything's

155
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,520
covered today

156
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:35,329
there hasn't been any activity on the I

157
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,850
is is routing for spine leaf topology

158
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:40,050
I'll check on that with will check on

159
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,980
that with the offer see where they're

160
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:48,199
going not too much on we need more

161
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,700
discussion on the prefix originator and

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,450
there's been some discussion on the PCE

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,890
security capability I don't think it's

164
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:06,680
not ready for word and Google last call

165
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:06,680
yet though and that's it and I did it

166
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:57,590
Tony's next right and if it's PDF Jim

167
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:59,449
appellant Wong and no I'm not gonna do

168
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,990
the whole talking French my French isn't

169
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,180
that good today's update is on dynamic

170
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,340
flooding if you've been following along

171
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:11,890
we've been having lots of discussions a

172
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,890
lot of them went off list after Prague

173
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,000
no joy next slide please

174
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,960
okay so the issues that we did discuss

175
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:27,200
in Prague

176
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,470
do we want lands in the flooding

177
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,210
topology and our conclusion was yes

178
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:36,350
so that was accepted and that became

179
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:38,180
part of the draft next question was how

180
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,000
do we deal with temporary additions

181
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,160
if the flooding topology partitions in

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,500
some way we want to make temporary

183
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,420
additions to it to restore the flooding

184
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,150
topology so we can continue working and

185
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,030
the agreement was that we have an

186
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:58,370
implementation rate limiting of

187
00:11:52,030 --> 00:12:00,800
temporary additions okay we also had an

188
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,230
interim meeting we had many discussions

189
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,109
during that meeting the outcomes of that

190
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,270
are pretty straightforward we're going

191
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,030
to advertise which links are in the

192
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:14,360
flooding topology there are going to be

193
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:18,709
bits in the link attributes sub TLV and

194
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,900
link attributes Tod for OSPF and this is

195
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:25,330
an equivalent to the FT bit that came

196
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:30,020
from the CCL s are flooding Draft

197
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:32,750
okay small bug fix in the flooding

198
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,390
request TLV we listed a field as the

199
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,029
circuit types field this caused some

200
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,860
implementation confusion we really do

201
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,560
mean it to be a bit mask of the levels

202
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,370
it's not necessarily the same as the

203
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,219
circuit types so if you send a flooding

204
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,470
request on an l1 l2 circuit you don't

205
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,980
have to say both l1 and l2

206
00:12:51,470 --> 00:13:01,100
you could just say l1 okay so small

207
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:02,710
clarification any questions on that okay

208
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,230
next slide please

209
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:09,560
let's see we did a small change to the

210
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,410
area router ID TLV to try to compress it

211
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,500
a little bit that was a little bit

212
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:19,100
improvement in density we had a little

213
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,870
language clarification if the area

214
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:27,290
leader advertises a flooding topology

215
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,570
then dynamic flooding is active if the

216
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,480
area leader does not advertise a

217
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,089
flooding topology then dynamic flooding

218
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,870
is disabled and legacy flooding should

219
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,490
be used okay that's probably obvious but

220
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:46,460
we just wanted to be explicit and

221
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:49,760
clarify that one addition if you have an

222
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,270
area you may find that you may want to

223
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,870
have a backup area leader this is not

224
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,180
explicitly denoted by anything it's

225
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:03,800
obvious from the area leader election

226
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:06,890
who who the second node would be and we

227
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,859
explicitly allow that area leader that

228
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:14,330
backup area leader to also advertise a

229
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,430
flooding topology this helps against the

230
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,100
case where there is a failure in with

231
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,839
the area leader it simplifies and

232
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,850
smooths out the transition between the

233
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:28,670
two flooding topologies and let's see we

234
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,690
welcome Cuomo Chen as a co-author to the

235
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,849
draft

236
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,680
the FT bit and some of the other stuff

237
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,750
that we took from his draft this is now

238
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,849
incorporated so we've added him as a

239
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,579
co-author

240
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,680
one thing I forgot to put on the slides

241
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:46,699
we did do some work on a yang model for

242
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,649
this we did not get anything ready to

243
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:51,649
present in time for this ITF our

244
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:54,250
apologies we are looking for more

245
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:58,660
volunteers who want to work on yang

246
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:01,310
please see me if you are interested we

247
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:05,569
think that this draft is now pretty well

248
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:08,000
cooked some of us are trying to get this

249
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:12,019
code ready to ship we're going to ask

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,389
one last time for early allocation this

251
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:19,690
is our third request I mean I think

252
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:22,220
we're all ready for that this is

253
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:26,420
especially now that there isn't any

254
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:34,220
contention on the base and coatings is

255
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:34,920
there anything else I have to do pretty

256
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,100
please

257
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,170
[Music]

258
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,170
and that's all I have any questions

259
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:54,199
thank you okay yeah that was a pretty

260
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,970
successful outcome of the interim you

261
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,410
didn't have a lot of contention before

262
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:04,250
that happened everything's all good now

263
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:10,219
so I think we mo might be up next right

264
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:12,490
so we're gonna probably may stumble yeah

265
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:19,010
do we have a meet echo support person no

266
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:23,389
so we're gonna I'm hoping that let me

267
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:25,880
put my most presentation up yes hey can

268
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:28,370
ya yeah we can all see you emo in the on

269
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:34,779
one of the screens here and I'll pull

270
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,779
your presentation up now I think

271
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:54,040
so can you hear me

272
00:16:40,870 --> 00:17:04,000
yes look great it's this one

273
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:06,430
apology computation yes alright we know

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,589
can you see your site as well yes yes

275
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:12,100
very very clear okay excellent

276
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:14,139
take over hello everyone today I'm look

277
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:24,510
why don't we go fishing

278
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:28,930
I'll go so let's page so this version of

279
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:33,910
sling slot in commodity competition are

280
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:49,420
cold so basically everything is a little

281
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:53,950
bit related to rhythm we degree or so

282
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:58,320
for a lot in topology so the lump of

283
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:03,250
relations is the degree of that amount

284
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:07,120
for example for this Dragon Ball T our

285
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,770
work with our one has two connections on

286
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,100
the flooding object

287
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:18,190
so our while Steven Lee is - for more on

288
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:22,330
zero it has three connections on the

289
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:27,190
flooding topology so is degree the

290
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,169
degree of our are zero in three so for

291
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:34,660
each load we have a degree of a front of

292
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:38,890
our G the degree of CO 400 more G is the

293
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:41,320
maximum degree of all of the nodes of

294
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,690
degree so for example for this from our

295
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,669
following apology the degree of this

296
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,399
flood in the body is sweet because the

297
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:56,739
maximum degree among all other nodes is

298
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:59,139
so next page so the basic idea of why

299
00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:03,580
didn't want commutation is that we

300
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:06,428
started from a load with ammo which is

301
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:12,070
the smallest of the load I denote as a

302
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:17,229
gold and then a Buda a tree using this

303
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:22,839
our job as a road racer first strategy

304
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:27,759
and then we can equal no goat whose

305
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:29,408
degree is a one to another note to the

306
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,080
front wall to the foreign topology where

307
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:37,599
were Dubuque and then we have a flat in

308
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:43,139
topology in which Evernote connects at

309
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:46,269
the visa to close so do this computation

310
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:49,478
where were considered degrees on fog in

311
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:55,779
topology so that's the addition to the

312
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:58,589
previous version so next page so here we

313
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:03,940
have a some kind of foreign technology

314
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:07,059
examples computed by a novel so for each

315
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:11,139
of these topology the Morrigan topology

316
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:14,559
computed here using examples have the

317
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:19,959
degree of flood poverty extreme but for

318
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:23,908
London topology the Evernote and the

319
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:30,399
commodity had at least two connections

320
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:32,919
so the Florin topology can tolerant for

321
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:41,439
any one NECA figures on the flooding

322
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:45,489
technology so next page so here we just

323
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,299
take a one simple example of a wagon

324
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:53,440
horse computation so we go through the

325
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:57,339
detail steps just get some idea about of

326
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,710
their details ornamentation so we

327
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,879
consider five nodes

328
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:05,840
flush the black metal

329
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:09,020
and then based on visitor topology we

330
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,709
usually our algorithm to compute a

331
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:17,059
flagon apology so initially we started

332
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:21,679
with candidate Q which is equal for

333
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:26,539
short seek you can take one no the road

334
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:30,559
are German these are zero with degree in

335
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:33,500
zero and any previous hope the front

336
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,080
over the visa recently and then we have

337
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:40,789
a maximum degree given desta as

338
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:44,928
conditional constrain it is three so the

339
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:49,580
first establish establish that we just

340
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:53,480
remove the row or juror from the

341
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:58,879
candidate queue and then put a data our

342
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:03,830
journal to the flooded and then for each

343
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:09,500
load connect it with Arturo we add those

344
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:13,399
note into the CQ so in this property and

345
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:18,380
then we were other r1 r2 r3 and r4 into

346
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:21,669
the capital Q and it is favored one way

347
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:25,400
we will remove remove the first node

348
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:30,549
which is our woman so our wives previous

349
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:36,470
row R 0 R 0 degrees zeros so we can add

350
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:42,620
big R 1 R R 0 into the Friant of origin

351
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:46,640
so after we add R 1 to R 0 into the

352
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:51,020
foreign apology so we will update the

353
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,980
candidate list or each load connected to

354
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:59,650
R 1 here we have R 2 R 3 R 4

355
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:04,190
commanded to r1 which is not out of 140

356
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:06,140
Caesar those are 2 R 1 R 2 R 3 R 4

357
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:12,650
already in the candidate list in this

358
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:15,170
case we just add r1 as a new previous

359
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:19,970
hall into the

360
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:23,770
- three - on the site and over add r1 to

361
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:27,530
the Ares tribute hop and so on

362
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:35,510
then we come to the second is so it is

363
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:40,490
Stella - we will remove r2 from CQ so

364
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:46,850
these are on r0 have equally over to a 1

365
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:50,750
so we can add R 2 and R 0 this leak into

366
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:54,790
the flooding of origin and then we will

367
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:59,170
a curated the Canada to queue we see the

368
00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:02,450
nodes r3 and r4 which connect to the r2

369
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:05,150
so in this case because update the

370
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:08,900
previous hope of archery and Artois in

371
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:14,350
the C key and then the last one and step

372
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,350
three is that we can add a sweetie and

373
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:20,180
I'll throw this link into the flood and

374
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:24,410
apartment because right now our two

375
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:26,750
degrees - so you still Western maximum

376
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,080
degree we're given is which is three so

377
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:35,210
we had a are three and ours 0 this link

378
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,649
into the apology so after this one and

379
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,750
then we also updated their candidate

380
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:43,070
queue and then we come to the stable for

381
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:47,750
at stay before we remove our four from

382
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:53,720
CQ right now our four have a previous 4

383
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:55,850
r0 r1 r2 and so on because all those

384
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,120
degrees all these three so we can order

385
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:04,550
ethylene the people I for now 0 but we

386
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:07,280
have privet over r1 I was degrees is 1

387
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:10,430
so we can link between our for and r1

388
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,740
into London apology so we can add this

389
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:16,790
linger into the front abortion so at

390
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:21,280
this point we have a pewter a tree on

391
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,280
flooding apologies so next page

392
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:33,889
so for for this plan we just connect

393
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:38,840
Evernote degrees one to another node and

394
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:45,949
then the stereo five so the first note

395
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:50,449
we still with degree one is a no I - so

396
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:55,190
our our - we will find a note a find the

397
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:59,509
link between our two an acyl note so

398
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:04,039
right now what thumb is that the link r2

399
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:10,789
and r3 will be added to the fallen

400
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:16,639
apology because r3 has been among

401
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:19,700
degrees so we were editing our 203 into

402
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:27,049
the flooding apology so after this step

403
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:31,549
5 and then we only care for our 4 we

404
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:34,399
will have our 4 has 1 1 degrees with so

405
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:40,820
in this case well we will find big

406
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:44,449
return r4 + r2 because our r2 has a

407
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,928
minimum degree and also minimum node IDs

408
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:51,259
so after this step and then we have a

409
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:54,969
collaborative orgy his flooded hopper G

410
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:57,950
the degree 3 and then Evernote has

411
00:26:54,969 --> 00:27:02,979
connected to at least the to know

412
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,979
sorrowful an apology so next next page

413
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:10,789
so here so previous we just go through

414
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:13,159
for example get some idea was at a

415
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:17,450
detail of algorithm so here is some kind

416
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,989
of a more formal descriptions about a

417
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,509
chrism

418
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:25,519
so this algorithm start from a node R 0

419
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:31,129
as I wrote and then this a wrote will

420
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:33,649
have a minimum of smallest node IDs some

421
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:37,399
systems make that and then we were given

422
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:37,729
a maximum degree and then we will have a

423
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,719
kind

424
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:44,120
the queue initially and Canada were only

425
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,550
contain is a Al Jarreau as a as a as a

426
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,179
vote and then we start with the empty

427
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:52,220
lot in topology and then this one would

428
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,420
give more details about this one harder

429
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,690
with the road again

430
00:27:53,420 --> 00:28:00,890
usually the degree of Archer is 0 and

431
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:05,540
then the previous host of Arcturus is

432
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:08,020
empty so next phase so from that

433
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,389
standpoint again we just go through

434
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,940
several steps in this algorithm so

435
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:17,870
basically first super one is that we

436
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,730
move finer and remove an element from a

437
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:22,760
candidate the queue and then stop

438
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:26,350
satisfy some conditions such as we

439
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:30,710
should have a one of his previous halt

440
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:33,110
that his prints for the degree business

441
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,210
is less than the man some a degree so we

442
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,340
find that pattern admin and then remove

443
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,950
that element from a candidate list then

444
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,820
I had that one into the for an apology

445
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:47,600
and then we thinned the Kaneda to kill

446
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:50,600
hazardous vapor one so stable to give up

447
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,020
the more details about hallway you

448
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,909
submit the cannibal queue so due to that

449
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,750
better know the way we moved from from

450
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:02,720
Canada queue and there you were data

451
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,070
node is no longer candid with you and

452
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,780
then we just add that nobody in the

453
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,790
kinetic you even I don't know that is

454
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:13,070
already in the kinetic view and then we

455
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:17,740
can stir updated the previous hope so

456
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:20,450
that's the way updated the kinetic you

457
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,370
so even we order those on the forgotten

458
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,770
apology and then that we are go to the

459
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:27,520
right step which is a connector every

460
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:31,750
node whose degrees one to another node

461
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,660
sorry that we have a following topology

462
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,490
in which every node has at least two

463
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,220
connections on the photic of origin and

464
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:48,110
then we have a weather of the hot water

465
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:50,360
we have so nice page so we welcome your

466
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,600
comments and also I think we can

467
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:58,879
like to request that option so I haven't

468
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:03,408
questioned no Cummins this is a seal

469
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,590
indem ah is there any IPR on this idea I

470
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:08,690
think there might be IPR before you know

471
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,580
at some point that from some from way

472
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:14,299
back but because Brett because a lot of

473
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,939
people have said that we should do it

474
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:21,379
first on based on you know the degree

475
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,179
and now this actually formalizes with

476
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,159
the algorithm to do it based on degree

477
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,320
so I'm wondering if anybody's knows of

478
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,240
IPR on this yes yes

479
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,090
yeah well away won't disclose of the

480
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,019
iPad to remind of it that's good yeah

481
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:40,850
yes the other question is I read it I

482
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:43,090
think you need to describe the usage of

483
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,439
previous/next top better in the drought

484
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,209
maybe even have some of these pictures

485
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,940
if you could I mean I know it's hard

486
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,970
with ASCII art but it's hard time hard

487
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,980
to understand it and maybe I didn't put

488
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,380
enough time into it but I understood it

489
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,059
better this time with the pictures and I

490
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,779
didn't when I first read it that's my

491
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:11,299
mom

492
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:13,760
yeah I Tony Lee Arista when we first

493
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:17,539
established the dynamic flooding draft

494
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,250
we didn't issue an IPR statement I'm not

495
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:21,799
a lawyer I can't tell you whether covers

496
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,889
this or not okay

497
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:28,580
but it was Tim the light I care a

498
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:31,219
statement on gameplay now everybody's

499
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,850
got my PR on Dinah flooding so I'm not

500
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,049
trying to block a and I'm just trying to

501
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,029
have your lawyers gonna look at patent

502
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:40,549
application it was it was it a rest of

503
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:44,210
it you did yeah do you know that do they

504
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:48,168
have like a friendly the language is

505
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:50,630
taken from other IPR disclosures that

506
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:53,720
says basically don't see us and we won't

507
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:56,360
sue you okay good and we were said that

508
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:02,720
very pointedly directing it to the east

509
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,570
of us okay claim oh thank you very much

510
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,550
for the present

511
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:11,700
that helped myself and my colleagues

512
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:15,030
looked at your draft very carefully and

513
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,410
scratched our heads and and we were very

514
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,940
disappointed that you are not here to

515
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,920
discuss it with us

516
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,660
you really want to understand this and

517
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,240
we're not quite there yet is really the

518
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:32,570
intent here the primary crux of the

519
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:41,610
algorithm to be breadth-first search yes

520
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:45,649
we base our search computed the property

521
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:51,899
may also come considered the amateurs of

522
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:58,290
a single bathroom a way to get a good

523
00:32:51,900 --> 00:33:01,980
habit so as I believe it that's just a

524
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:04,340
one pergola right now okay so anything

525
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,240
you can do to help clarify the

526
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,659
presentation of the algorithm would be

527
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,010
very helpful to us we we're not there

528
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,980
yet

529
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:16,890
second have you done anything in your

530
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:39,450
algorithm to constrain the diameter of

531
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:41,640
the flooding topology good we didn't see

532
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,800
anything in there that would ensure that

533
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:51,270
you didn't have a ballooning diameter

534
00:33:43,800 --> 00:34:00,980
and that would be suboptimal maybe we

535
00:33:51,270 --> 00:34:06,210
just don't understand yet maybe we can

536
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:10,590
our reward and to see what can one we

537
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:12,620
will have for the parameters okay thank

538
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,620
you

539
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,960
okay good I think you know we're gonna

540
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,609
discuss this a lot more on the list and

541
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,409
I'd like to encourage that in interest

542
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:24,328
of the time we'll like to get to the

543
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,829
next one after Alvaro talks next

544
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:29,490
personalization I'll order thunder

545
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:31,260
rolling just a quick commercial that's

546
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:36,899
all of you are probably aware we have a

547
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:41,700
new format for the RFC's and so you can

548
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:46,199
now put actual art pictures so you can

549
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,848
look at as SBG graphs I think so

550
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,799
you're come into the Oh maybe figures in

551
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:51,869
there will be nice I think this would be

552
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,710
a great opportunity to have this trap

553
00:34:51,869 --> 00:35:00,510
the Version three of the artisan

554
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:05,430
just and I love ASCII art too though so

555
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:07,230
I like if you if you can't manage to do

556
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:10,230
the topology or it's not clear and it

557
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,930
would be much clearer with graphics then

558
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:16,829
yeah you do have the ability to use SVG

559
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:19,649
and RFC's I don't know if that'll be

560
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:22,230
required or not but the takeaway I think

561
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,540
we know is yeah it would be great if you

562
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,250
could put some of the things you have in

563
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,579
this presentation and maybe even some

564
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:31,770
more pictures they help a lot I think

565
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:33,150
that would call for adoption let's do

566
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,430
another round on this I don't think

567
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,960
anybody has any objections to this you

568
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,730
know it's looking good but there are

569
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,569
some open questions let's work on that

570
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,280
and make sure that we address the

571
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:46,619
questions like the diameter and stuff

572
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,390
like that and as long as nothing pops

573
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,829
out that looks strange I don't see why

574
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:54,000
the working group wouldn't want to adopt

575
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:56,250
something like this okay so we're gonna

576
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:05,299
move to the next graphic the next

577
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:09,990
presentation oh thank you we will okay

578
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:11,880
yeah so I so we have a couple of

579
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:15,229
presentations coming up with the just

580
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,230
want to explain something on these

581
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:24,690
so we have a proposal about flooding

582
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,410
speed advertisement that was put forward

583
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:31,559
by Bruno in a draft there's some how we

584
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,269
got a scheduled for a bottle coming this

585
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:35,099
is sort of interesting to me because it

586
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:37,680
happened to me the first time that I

587
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:40,339
presented in is is about twenty years

588
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,390
ago or something I I got a surprise

589
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:44,970
presentation that came up right after me

590
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,859
thinks Tony leap had Hank Schmitt come

591
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:51,269
up and tell everyone why the thing I

592
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:53,250
just presented was useless so I just

593
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:56,848
realized that this was a little payback

594
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,079
I guess but it was totally not I didn't

595
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,329
realize that there hadn't been anything

596
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,250
discussed between the two groups before

597
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:04,710
this presentation was put on there

598
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,839
anyway nothing is being decided here

599
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,670
right so this is just a presentation

600
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,519
there will be a presentation following

601
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,529
Bruno's where there there's sort of

602
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,149
addressing and disagreeing with some of

603
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:17,730
the points you're about to see but again

604
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,079
nothing is being decided here and Bruno

605
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,720
sent us something he's not had a chance

606
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,059
to really go over that presentation so

607
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,319
he felt a little bit like hey I would

608
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,730
have liked to have seen this before I

609
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:29,490
presented so I could have maybe

610
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:31,140
addressed these points I'm sympathetic

611
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,368
to that like I said twenty years ago the

612
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,519
same thing happened to me and I didn't

613
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:34,519
like it

614
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:54,809
it might cook it if it doesn't work and

615
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:58,230
no okay I'm gonna okay so hello I'm

616
00:37:54,809 --> 00:38:01,950
Bruno from our engine I'm going to talk

617
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,390
about drive to improve flooding speed so

618
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,490
just to try Phi it's just about

619
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,940
communication speed between two two

620
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,109
neighbors it's not competing with

621
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:15,599
proposal radio sings of routing a

622
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:17,430
topology or graph so next one please so

623
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,670
as an instruction it's probably well

624
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:25,049
known to everyone but still flooding is

625
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:27,329
a very important for link state I GP if

626
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:29,470
you slow flooding a hit directly

627
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:31,690
translate to

628
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:35,549
a slow reaction to failure so packet

629
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:38,410
loss and so it's translated to LSD be

630
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:41,349
inconsistency and routing is

631
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:45,038
inconsistency and you have a chance to

632
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:48,190
have my groups unfortunately a footing

633
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:52,299
is odd you want to be fast to have you

634
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:54,069
our database instinct especially in case

635
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:56,859
of a single node failure which is just

636
00:38:54,069 --> 00:39:00,729
one failure but for links that IGP

637
00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:03,460
translating into multiple messages so it

638
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:06,038
could be an ax and could be a 10 20

639
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,579
depending on your topology so you need

640
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:13,239
to be able to fast through the 10 or 20

641
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:16,450
SPD messages quite fast just for single

642
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:18,789
node failure at the same time you need

643
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:23,288
to be slow in order to not overload your

644
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:24,640
adjustment neighbor so it's enough to to

645
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:27,819
not overload your neighbor because

646
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,339
flooding is a up by up so you're just

647
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:33,910
sending message to your neighbor so it's

648
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:38,140
between two adjacent neighbor next a

649
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:40,598
slight kiss so so what is the status in

650
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:44,078
Isis we don't have any signaling to

651
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:45,729
control the fruiting speed on the

652
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,559
current status in term of implementation

653
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:50,739
is that the fruiting speed is a very

654
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:54,749
very conservative so default delay

655
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:58,180
between sending two consecutive SPD is

656
00:39:54,749 --> 00:40:01,868
something like 33 milliseconds or 100

657
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:06,089
milliseconds which is about 30 packets

658
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:09,999
per seconds hundred kilo bits whenever

659
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:12,249
if you compare a ring to to the same

660
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:16,058
control planes bidding a speaking BGP

661
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:19,328
over TCP on to some implementations a

662
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:21,880
BGP policy is set to 20,000 packet per

663
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:26,200
circle which is a 200 megabits

664
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,359
so it's 1,000 faster so the goal is not

665
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,899
to go to 1,000 faster but there is room

666
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:33,910
for improvement and finally we have the

667
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,599
same flooding speed for the last 20

668
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:40,660
years even so even though the CPE on

669
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,770
interfaces speed up improve so it

670
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:47,529
probably shows that something

671
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:50,300
is missing so next one please

672
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:53,930
so the proposition is it's very simple

673
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:56,930
it's just one TLV to be able to

674
00:40:53,930 --> 00:41:00,230
advertise your own capability to receive

675
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:04,220
SPD's message messages to your upstream

676
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:07,970
neighbors so I entered on screen I am

677
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:10,160
capable of receiving eyes--eyes LSPD you

678
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,140
were to a certain speed and I advertised

679
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,399
that capability to my upstream routing

680
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:18,920
never so Y arrow again because we are

681
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,450
just discussing between adjacent

682
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:28,930
neighbors so that's all when children

683
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:31,250
arrows lights okay next thank you

684
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:35,000
so actually we advertised true

685
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:36,860
parameters in such l visa we try to to

686
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,590
be aligned with existing implementations

687
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:45,950
in order to to to to make it simpler and

688
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:48,800
to increase the likelihood on a speed of

689
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:52,580
deployment so we have two parameters

690
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,619
next with Pisa so the first parameter is

691
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:58,220
called it's caused is called minimum

692
00:41:54,619 --> 00:42:02,230
interface LSP transmission interval so

693
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:04,939
the name is long but it's only the delay

694
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:11,170
in milliseconds between two consecutive

695
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:13,670
areas PDU so it's nothing you it's a

696
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,280
parameter which is available in all

697
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:18,920
existing implementation so sometimes

698
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,990
it's called LSP interval some some time

699
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,070
it's where LSP base interval sometimes

700
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:28,160
karelis PT X in tower something so

701
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:30,500
nothing new in term of fruiting and that

702
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,180
parameter is akin to a CPU or processing

703
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,280
performance so basically you commit that

704
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:40,430
you're capable of in average processing

705
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:44,079
some LSP you per minute per second so

706
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:47,618
for example Sochi next column

707
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:51,459
second parameter is the ability to to

708
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:55,299
send a burst of consecutive LSPD you so

709
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:57,779
you okay excuse you say I agree that you

710
00:42:55,299 --> 00:43:01,059
can send me a purely speedy you

711
00:42:57,779 --> 00:43:04,900
back-to-back if you want up to n n LSP

712
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:06,549
deal it's less popular in term of

713
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,380
imitation but there are implementation

714
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:11,140
it's called a fast-food risible

715
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:14,829
on one implementation on and so many

716
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:16,719
implementation of a DDoS filtering to to

717
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:20,109
limit the amount of packets that you can

718
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:23,769
receive to avoid leaders so that

719
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:28,269
parameter is akin to a memory buffer so

720
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:34,868
you can keep in memory a few SP before

721
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:36,669
processing it so that's all know so

722
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:41,319
that's all to two parameters in one

723
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:45,699
chill V there is a smaller or refinement

724
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:47,619
is that actually for fast fluid we say

725
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:51,609
it's a it's a number of non acknowledge

726
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:54,039
LSPD you not only the number of a speedy

727
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:57,808
you that you can send in bursts so next

728
00:43:54,039 --> 00:44:02,489
one so with that precision we can go

729
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:05,529
even more precisely to our flow control

730
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:07,390
because i size does have a mechanism to

731
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:13,479
acknowledge the reception rate speedy

732
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:17,199
you basically using a PS NP on one point

733
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:19,749
two point interfaces so ISS can already

734
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:23,529
advertise the reception or acknowledge

735
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:25,808
the reception of each SD on with that we

736
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:29,529
have a dynamic flow controller if you

737
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:31,420
want so with two two parameters the one

738
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:32,920
which is a sizable burst so the memories

739
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,069
that you can have which is a static

740
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,679
transmission window so remember it

741
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:41,949
remember static transition window will

742
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:45,789
have a test in a few minute and then we

743
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:50,019
have a x SN p or p SN p which sell that

744
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:51,099
as denominational acknowledgements so

745
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,678
you can acknowledge that you have

746
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:54,779
removed an SPD you outside of your

747
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,019
buffer

748
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:58,019
next one please

749
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:05,119
so in summary we want to improve ICS

750
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:08,390
communications penis off-roading speed

751
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,549
we are authorizing - static parameters

752
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,989
from the done string reading never up to

753
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:17,069
the extreme pruning never so

754
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:18,900
point-to-point on these two parameters

755
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:21,390
match existing implementation at least

756
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:25,460
for the first one on partially for the

757
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:25,460
second one the next one

758
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:34,078
so with that single glv the upstream can

759
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:36,808
do different kind of behaviors up to him

760
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,079
so the first kind of behavior is to

761
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:43,589
coordinate on CSD pacing so that one is

762
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,589
very easy to do because it's already

763
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:49,710
available on all implementation but with

764
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:51,869
with the extension you you agree with

765
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:55,799
your neighbor on all fast you can

766
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:58,979
process at a speedy LSPD you and even

767
00:45:55,799 --> 00:46:01,019
with that single limb improvement it can

768
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:05,129
be significant in real life because I

769
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:06,508
think everyone will agree that routing

770
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:10,440
speed is very very conservative

771
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:13,920
currently so can behavior that you can

772
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,579
do is to allow sending a burst a very

773
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,029
speedy you which is very useful for on

774
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:22,680
link node failure because in term of if

775
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:25,680
you have a single node failure it

776
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,879
translated in l n LSP to be to be free

777
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,339
there so it's good to be able to

778
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,210
advertise quickly that when one node has

779
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:36,029
been removed from the top regime and

780
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:39,420
also possibility open by that new TLV if

781
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:41,339
you have dynamic flow control which will

782
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,469
be a significant improvement compared to

783
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:47,489
a static SP SP by things that we have

784
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:51,529
today but any of those improvement is

785
00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:55,619
its local to the upstream fooding level

786
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:58,079
the only things that is a monetary is

787
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,890
that gel V that is being sent from the

788
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:05,110
downstream

789
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:13,089
coding never and that's or any comment

790
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:15,130
I have a fella

791
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,140
BIOS very clear so I have a couple of

792
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,250
questions why did you use the term

793
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,250
upstream several times

794
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,580
can you come greedy it doesn't sound

795
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:34,540
like you're coming over the mic I don't

796
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:36,880
know is it is it not okay so we use the

797
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,310
same upstream pruiting on downstream

798
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,440
treating the issue is that at the

799
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,810
beginning we use the sending rotor on

800
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,250
the receiving route but there are two

801
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:48,490
sending autos the one sending that

802
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:50,530
Silvie on the one sending ZL SPD so it

803
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,299
was not very clear just did you should

804
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,220
put that in the draft because you know

805
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,100
we have one definition of upstream and

806
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:01,299
downstream for MPLS label assignment we

807
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:05,980
have another one for multicast and so in

808
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,450
the context it's not okay so in general

809
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,390
the reserved stream is that there's a

810
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,580
one-cent exhibit don't string so but the

811
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:20,859
packet is the LAPD you in in my case in

812
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:22,870
the case of my size should you maybe do

813
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:25,060
it 100 microseconds or something else

814
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:27,970
because millisecond means you can only

815
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:30,190
do one per millisecond which means a

816
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:33,129
thousand per second depend on your birth

817
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:36,550
size but it's still limits and you just

818
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:39,300
said that BGP does 3000 per second so

819
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:42,070
maybe the you know let's not stick to

820
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,390
millisecond because everyone let's use a

821
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,450
number that makes sense

822
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:48,009
I think Zack same comment when I read

823
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,290
through it I thought but the bits and

824
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:52,720
the tlb are pretty cheap you could just

825
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:56,259
make it's 32-bit instead of 16-bit and

826
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,850
called microseconds whatever I feel

827
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,650
really thank you for documents we

828
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:01,470
already receive determine by email it

829
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:04,210
was a bit too late to change the draft

830
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:06,370
but I agree that many seconds could be

831
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,400
limiting in the future even though it

832
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:11,770
would be already happy if we could

833
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,490
reduce up to 1 millisecond but you're

834
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:18,650
right

835
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:22,169
absolutely Thank You Josie

836
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,940
so to my memory are flooding as today's

837
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:28,110
cup of an instance right

838
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:30,600
either it's applicable to instance you

839
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:33,000
are moving in yes sir adjacency if you

840
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,009
have 10,000 audiences and everybody

841
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,130
signal different interval you'll have to

842
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:42,630
create state or adjacency

843
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:46,920
it will create some problem what what

844
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:48,650
problem so today you generate updates if

845
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:53,310
you don't you send them in same place

846
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:56,780
everybody right here you are introducing

847
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,779
or adjacent system

848
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:03,120
you really have implementations which

849
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:05,250
have LSP pacing per interfaces so it's

850
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,600
nothing really new it's already uh I

851
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:13,790
don't know for all implementation okay I

852
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,790
don't want to give their names but yes

853
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:21,420
ok so now I guess we'll take the

854
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:24,720
remaining I was willing to let that run

855
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:26,970
over as far as it wanted to go now I

856
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,589
guess less is going to present his

857
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:33,859
opinion along with ACS and Peters on

858
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,860
this work

859
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:48,750
[Music]

860
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:50,620
Bruno did not get to view this house or

861
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:53,080
um

862
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:55,509
why we're bringing the slides up I just

863
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:58,750
like to make the point that Bruno and I

864
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:00,070
actually do talk to each other and I'd

865
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:02,710
like to think we're not enemies

866
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:04,540
so even though I'm gonna disagree with

867
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:13,530
some of the things he said there has

868
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:13,529
been a fair amount of communication no

869
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:23,710
well no disagreement okay next slide so

870
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,420
just a very quick review of what

871
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:28,360
Burroughs just presented

872
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:30,550
I took some poetic license here and I

873
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,860
changed the names that you have in the

874
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:36,100
draft just to emphasize the point that

875
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,630
what's being specified in the new TLV is

876
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:41,170
from the point of view of the receiver

877
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:43,390
so this is the the minimum interval in

878
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,550
which I would like to receive felis B's

879
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:47,770
the minimum int well in which I would

880
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:52,500
like the minimum burst that I would like

881
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:55,300
to receive and this can potentially be

882
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,710
adjusted dynamically although I believe

883
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,450
there's language in the draft that says

884
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:03,700
it's not a good idea to do this too

885
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:06,480
often okay next slide so here's what we

886
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:09,490
agree on we definitely agree that

887
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,190
flooding at least as it's been defined

888
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:15,759
historically and and defaults in most

889
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:19,240
implementations is much too slow for for

890
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,880
modern networks so we agree that we want

891
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,689
to allow for the capability to flood

892
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:27,640
much faster than we do by default today

893
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:29,980
but we also agree that doing so entails

894
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:34,799
some risk and therefore we want to have

895
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,800
some means of flow control next slide

896
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:42,570
here's what we disagree on the the

897
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:44,830
essence of the draft is to send

898
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:46,930
parameters that control the state per

899
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:50,860
interface I think this is related to the

900
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,430
point that Jeff was asking about it

901
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,829
isn't

902
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:56,288
the value that you want to use for

903
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:58,150
flooding is not a a per interface value

904
00:52:56,289 --> 00:53:01,450
and I'll go into a little more detail

905
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:03,010
here the second point is the draft

906
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:05,500
specifies the flow control should be

907
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:07,270
managed by the receiver and we believe

908
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,349
it should be managed by the transmitter

909
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,349
next slide

910
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:18,940
so flooding is part of what allows you

911
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,700
to achieve Network wide convergence just

912
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:25,000
as we do with SPF intervals if you

913
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:27,609
configure vastly different SPF intervals

914
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,900
on different nodes the convergence

915
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:30,520
behavior their network is going to

916
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,279
suffer because some portions of the

917
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,538
network are going to converge

918
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:36,819
significantly faster than other portions

919
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:40,119
of the network same thing is true with

920
00:53:36,819 --> 00:53:42,160
flooding because if I run my SPF but the

921
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:45,940
information I'm running my SPF on is

922
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,868
doesn't match that of my neighbors then

923
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,490
I'm going to come to a different

924
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,319
conclusion I'm going to temporarily

925
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:52,149
install different routes in the for any

926
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:55,690
plane and are going to be vulnerable to

927
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:59,200
loops and black holes and so forth so we

928
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:01,930
strongly believe that the the value that

929
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:04,770
you want to use for pacing your LSP

930
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:06,879
flooding needs to be a network-wide

931
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:13,690
parameter not a pretty interface

932
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:17,049
parameter next slide this is I did some

933
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:19,390
archaeological research here back in ISO

934
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:23,710
10 589 there's actually some language in

935
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:25,509
10 589 that reinforces this point that

936
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,730
the language here specifies that the

937
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,970
this was talking about the retransmit

938
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:33,279
timer the retransmit timer is per LSB

939
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:36,038
but it's not per LSB per interface

940
00:54:33,279 --> 00:54:40,000
it's simply per LSB so if I need to read

941
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:42,039
transmit an LSB then I want to do so at

942
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,569
the same time on all of the interfaces

943
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:45,730
on which I have yet to receive an

944
00:54:43,569 --> 00:54:49,509
acknowledgment I don't want to tune this

945
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:52,960
to a per interface value this maximizes

946
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:56,049
the possibility that all the nodes in

947
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:59,319
the network are going to converge on the

948
00:54:56,049 --> 00:55:03,150
same LSB database in a more consistent

949
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:03,150
manner next slide

950
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:13,760
receiver given flow control the ability

951
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:17,270
of a node to decide gee you know I'm I'm

952
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:21,650
I'm getting things too fast for whatever

953
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:24,610
reason my CPU is overloaded my plan Q

954
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:28,820
from the data plane is overloaded but

955
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:31,460
whatever the reason may be many

956
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:33,920
implementations implements an LSP input

957
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:36,680
Q is simply a FIFO not a pretty

958
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,110
interface FIFO but just well no matter

959
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:41,089
what interface ie I got this in on I'm

960
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:42,920
gonna stick it into a queue and when I

961
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:46,820
get around to processing that queue I'm

962
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:49,550
gonna process them first in first out so

963
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:53,720
if that queue which oftentimes is

964
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:55,880
bounded if that kid gets overloaded okay

965
00:55:53,720 --> 00:56:00,020
it's an indication that I'm getting

966
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:02,120
swamped but who's wanting me unless I

967
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:04,150
actually go through and process the LSPs

968
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,400
in the input queue I can't figure out

969
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:09,770
who you know which of my neighbors might

970
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,100
be the one who's sending stuff to me too

971
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:15,500
fast and in addition you know based on

972
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,319
the points you know we made in the

973
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:21,140
previous slides I don't really want to

974
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,000
have a per interface you know a slower

975
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:27,770
rate on one interface and a faster rate

976
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,620
on another interface so the rationale

977
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:33,800
for saying I want to advertise a slower

978
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:36,440
rate to this one neighbor but allow the

979
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,730
faster rate to some other neighbor is

980
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,340
both a problem from an implementation

981
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:42,770
standpoint it is not the behavior we

982
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:43,460
want in order to optimize Network

983
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:50,630
convergence

984
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:52,250
I mean just make clear you're making a

985
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:56,030
point based on assumptions about

986
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:57,770
implementation you're saying I don't

987
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:01,460
know who sends it to me because my

988
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:04,580
implementation uses a single FIFO LSP

989
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:06,320
queue I mean so yes for an

990
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,799
implementation that uses a single white

991
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,840
ball in a input queue for LSPs this is

992
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,970
not easy careful

993
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,740
not a good solution but it's not that

994
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:18,189
doesn't mean that for all

995
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:19,959
implementations of is is this is this is

996
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:24,700
hard to identify who's sending you the

997
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:27,070
speeds so I'm not necessarily going to

998
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:29,379
disagree with you there's a number of

999
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,490
points being made here and I think one

1000
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:33,100
of the points is there are

1001
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:35,020
implementations that do this more than

1002
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,450
one from my personal experience that

1003
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:40,660
doesn't mean all implementations do this

1004
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:43,140
and there are some good reasons for an

1005
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:49,569
implementation to implement it this way

1006
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:51,670
so you know you might want that

1007
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:53,440
implement your application that you know

1008
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,760
when you chose to do the single FIFO you

1009
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,490
didn't have something you know there

1010
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,160
were different considerations you know I

1011
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:01,629
could counter by saying if I do this per

1012
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,670
interface now I got to come up with a

1013
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:08,140
fairness algorithm anyways

1014
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:09,970
let's not debate that the second point I

1015
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:16,060
want to make about receiver driven flow

1016
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:17,560
control well actually actually sorry can

1017
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:23,070
you go back one slight I may have missed

1018
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:27,850
something here yeah yeah yeah so

1019
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:30,340
descending of the the updated receive

1020
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:34,690
interval is essentially an out-of-band

1021
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:36,430
signaling mechanism okay I you know I

1022
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,990
detect the condition where I want to

1023
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,839
tell you know one or more of my

1024
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:42,759
neighbors to slow down I'm doing this at

1025
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,560
a time when I'm very busy if I'm very

1026
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,560
busy it's quite likely that my neighbors

1027
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:52,870
are very busy and at this point in time

1028
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:54,640
I now have to send additional BTUs okay

1029
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:56,920
no words for this to be effective I

1030
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:59,109
can't wait 10 seconds until my next

1031
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,610
hello interval you know that's going to

1032
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:03,100
let the condition persist for much

1033
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:05,020
longer than I would like so I've got to

1034
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,420
introduce extra processing both for

1035
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,100
myself and for my neighbors precisely at

1036
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:14,740
the time when everybody's the most busy

1037
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:16,900
which to me is a disadvantage next slide

1038
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,330
this obviously depends on some protocol

1039
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,100
extensions so it's not going to be

1040
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:23,290
effective if I send this but my neighbor

1041
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,170
doesn't support it so I have to wait for

1042
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:26,570
everybody

1043
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,200
to upgrade to get the maximum benefit

1044
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,720
out of this

1045
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,740
if you do this in a brown field you're

1046
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:37,270
not gonna get the full benefit next line

1047
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:42,500
so what should we do

1048
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:44,180
okay ice ice 101 what do we do we when

1049
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,510
we have a Nellis beat to sin we mark it

1050
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:49,669
with a send routing message bit and the

1051
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:52,310
SRM bit and I'm talking here strictly

1052
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:54,110
about point to point we know broadcast

1053
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:56,330
interfaces work a little bit differently

1054
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:58,930
but for the purposes of this discussion

1055
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:03,770
I think we can stick to point to point

1056
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:06,470
the SRM stays set until we actually get

1057
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:09,110
into an acknowledgment on that

1058
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:14,500
particular interface the retransmit

1059
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:19,250
timer will fire and we will resend any

1060
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:24,560
LSB that has been unacknowledged from

1061
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:28,210
the transmit side I know how many LS B's

1062
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:30,470
that I have for a particular interface

1063
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:32,690
that I have sent that I have not

1064
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:35,870
received acknowledgement for I have all

1065
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,580
of that information okay and when I have

1066
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:40,339
that information I don't particularly

1067
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:42,560
care why the LSB was not acknowledged

1068
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:45,230
does my neighbor was my neighbor does he

1069
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,330
not have enough CPU time it is received

1070
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:49,610
you through small did he have problems

1071
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:54,500
in the punt path I don't care all I know

1072
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:57,320
is that I need to be retransmitting and

1073
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:01,340
I've got all the information to tell me

1074
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:03,260
how big the retransmit Q is so using

1075
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:05,540
this information I can do flow control

1076
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,220
from the transmit side I don't need any

1077
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:10,070
protocol extensions I don't need any

1078
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:16,040
extra signaling from my neighbor next

1079
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:18,940
slide if this is just one potential

1080
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:21,710
algorithm it's not an algorithm that I'm

1081
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:25,190
intending to you know to say this is the

1082
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:28,820
best or the only or whatever but

1083
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:31,160
basically you you set an upper bound for

1084
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,289
your

1085
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:37,819
unacknowledged LSPs on a particular

1086
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:40,940
interface when you hit that limit then

1087
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:43,699
you slow down the rate at which you send

1088
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,789
Alice B's to that neighbor and you

1089
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:49,039
persist in doing this until the number

1090
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:51,049
of unacknowledged Ellis piece goes below

1091
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:55,339
some safe limit then you go back to your

1092
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:56,029
your default setting when this condition

1093
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:58,150
occurs

1094
01:01:56,029 --> 01:02:02,209
I think this condition should be logged

1095
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:04,099
because as we discussed before we want

1096
01:02:02,209 --> 01:02:06,769
to have the consistent flooding rate on

1097
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:09,619
all the interfaces in the network so

1098
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:12,439
that we can get the optimal convergence

1099
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:15,559
and if you have a node that is

1100
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,209
consistently not able to keep up then

1101
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:19,309
the convergence in your network is going

1102
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:21,198
to suffer and you need to let the

1103
01:02:19,309 --> 01:02:23,900
operator know so the operator can decide

1104
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:25,339
what does he want to do about this you

1105
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,259
know does he have an underpowered node

1106
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:31,940
does he have a miss configuration that's

1107
01:02:27,259 --> 01:02:33,769
causing you know too much traffic to go

1108
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,630
to this node what does he want to do

1109
01:02:33,769 --> 01:02:38,868
does he want to slow down the rate

1110
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:42,019
across the whole network you know he's

1111
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:44,289
got many choices and we need to let him

1112
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:48,169
know that this condition is is occurring

1113
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:49,940
next slide so there's a bunch of things

1114
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:55,190
in this space that actually have been

1115
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:57,979
done and are out there fast floodings

1116
01:02:55,190 --> 01:03:00,440
been around for close to 20 years as

1117
01:02:57,979 --> 01:03:01,968
part of fast flooding or fast

1118
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,339
convergence I should say it's part of

1119
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:06,859
that and we have some kind of fast

1120
01:03:04,339 --> 01:03:10,519
flooding knob that says before you

1121
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:13,038
actually start your SPF send a bunch of

1122
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:15,258
LS B's to your neighbors so that we can

1123
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,150
speed up the propagation of LSPs through

1124
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:19,130
the network so we increase the

1125
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:21,079
probability that when everybody runs the

1126
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:26,900
next the SPF they actually have all of

1127
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:38,550
the updated LSB database yep am i

1128
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:40,260
running out of time okay so

1129
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,220
it was just the point on the slide

1130
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,440
there's a number of things have been

1131
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:46,259
done people are actually flooding faster

1132
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,570
than 33 milliseconds they've been doing

1133
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:51,510
so successfully I haven't heard about

1134
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:53,940
any problems with that so it isn't like

1135
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:56,280
we have just been able to turn this on

1136
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,710
and it doesn't work it does work next

1137
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,540
slide so what should we do we should

1138
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:03,510
encourage vendors to increase the

1139
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:04,680
flooding rate we need to emphasize the

1140
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,390
point that this neat this is a

1141
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,569
network-wide parameter not a per

1142
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:11,759
interface parameter use the TX base flow

1143
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:14,580
control we don't believe we need

1144
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,700
protocol extensions do we need a BCP

1145
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:22,970
draft if it was up to me probably not

1146
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:26,370
but I can I can be convinced so I think

1147
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:28,319
a lot of good work can be done on this I

1148
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:33,000
don't think that anybody has the right

1149
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:35,790
answer yet I I would also like the whole

1150
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,500
comments quickly of whoever heard of

1151
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,900
receiver based flow control what a crazy

1152
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:43,230
idea right or out of been signaling RTS

1153
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:46,470
CTS I think it's not crazy to want to do

1154
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:47,880
receiver side flow control but that said

1155
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,730
I mean I think you have some valid

1156
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,170
points that need to be discussed like

1157
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,400
the different types of you know you see

1158
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:54,840
if you're floating at different rates on

1159
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,750
different interfaces you're getting you

1160
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:59,340
know thing that again though that one

1161
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,930
could argue both ways right because as

1162
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,130
long as you get flooding is about

1163
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,750
getting it everywhere as fast as

1164
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:05,670
possible so if it's not going fast on

1165
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,930
this interface maybe it's going fast on

1166
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,910
another interface so I'm not sure if

1167
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:12,299
that's a big deal whatever we can

1168
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:14,609
discuss that on the list as well but so

1169
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,320
it's good to have I think to two points

1170
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,420
here though you've got a good point

1171
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,490
about hey I've got retransmits I can do

1172
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,680
trans transmission side flow control

1173
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:24,629
that way I think that the other other

1174
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,509
authors have a good point about maybe we

1175
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,940
need to look at receiver size I don't

1176
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:31,580
know if this is you know I wish this

1177
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:34,140
would have happened on the list first

1178
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:36,150
right like that why are we doing why

1179
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,080
didn't these comments come out after the

1180
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:39,120
draft was published

1181
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,290
I'm not attacking you I'm just I think

1182
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:46,200
that would have been a better way to

1183
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:48,180
approach this in the presentation it all

1184
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:52,109
happens very quickly but around the

1185
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:52,500
draft cutoff times so well but there was

1186
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:55,080
time too

1187
01:05:52,500 --> 01:06:05,490
together a presentation right and

1188
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:07,500
there's no mailing list cutoff time to

1189
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:11,879
be perfect yeah so too many drops too

1190
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:17,430
little time overall I largely agree with

1191
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:20,310
lasts long experience the different rate

1192
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:22,470
to cause a transient on the network is

1193
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:24,900
very pronounced in sparse network the

1194
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:27,118
denser the networks get the less that is

1195
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:30,119
an issue you actually flip it to the

1196
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,980
other side so the per node behavior is

1197
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,840
largely an artifact of a very very old

1198
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,520
spec that has been a little bit too

1199
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:39,090
specific now to implement these things

1200
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:41,730
right so if you have dense networks and

1201
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:45,450
with modern techniques the per interface

1202
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:48,690
is doable so depend which you know which

1203
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:52,950
part which part of the design space you

1204
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:54,810
eat the constant rate indicated per

1205
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:58,348
second is definitely not enough things

1206
01:06:54,810 --> 01:07:00,150
change very very quickly and let's give

1207
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:02,760
you a large part of the solution you

1208
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:05,369
should basically look on the sender more

1209
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,700
on the losses that is a much simpler

1210
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:09,510
ticket and don't ramp up too

1211
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,520
aggressively

1212
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:13,410
I mean you have it slightly hidden right

1213
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:16,020
like don't be too optimistic when things

1214
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:17,609
go well but you can also know where you

1215
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:19,290
don't have enough throughput when you

1216
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:22,109
want to really bump up there it's also

1217
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:25,560
very good to keep for that so I agreed

1218
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:27,390
BCP is probably all we need a lot of

1219
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:30,869
these techniques are only around and

1220
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:32,670
roughly what last chest is practically

1221
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:33,750
very doable I would only need agree of

1222
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,430
the peri interface I'll cooperate

1223
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:37,050
defense especially on their on the on

1224
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:39,180
the dense networks because then the

1225
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:40,440
slowest receiver starts to actually

1226
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,149
choke you if you have a lot of

1227
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,270
interfacing the slowest guys can climb

1228
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:46,890
sit down on flooding speed okay I think

1229
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:49,050
that there's a reason for a draft no

1230
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:51,270
matter what our resolution is because

1231
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:53,550
while you said that yes people might be

1232
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:56,869
violating in a 33 millisecond it is a

1233
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:59,280
violation of a standard and you can and

1234
01:07:56,869 --> 01:08:01,619
so you can give into these realms where

1235
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,080
you get operators who run a test that

1236
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:05,910
says I've used you know standard right

1237
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,680
and if you say

1238
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:08,848
look you're sending it faster than 33

1239
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,960
and then you have to do with

1240
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:11,789
justification words if you have a

1241
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,380
document we can point out saying the 20

1242
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:15,750
years later we think we can send that

1243
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:20,279
past 133 so we're revising the standards

1244
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:23,040
and I'll be so so one archaeological

1245
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:25,739
point if you actually look at 10 589 the

1246
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:28,049
33 millisecond is specified only for

1247
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:32,968
broadcast interfaces yeah there is no

1248
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:35,698
statement for point-to-point because you

1249
01:08:32,969 --> 01:08:37,469
can blast things as fast as you want and

1250
01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:40,858
it's expected layer 2 is expected to

1251
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:42,989
take care of that yes Chris power is

1252
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:45,299
with juniper could you go back a few

1253
01:08:42,988 --> 01:08:49,099
slides because I'm most of your

1254
01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:50,969
arguments are fairly superficial and

1255
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:59,100
inconsistent with one another

1256
01:08:50,969 --> 01:09:01,109
don't don't hold back Chris so you say

1257
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:02,880
updating hello is dynamically to alter

1258
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:04,319
flooding transmission rate is an

1259
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,540
out-of-band signaling mechanism

1260
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,730
consuming resources at the time when

1261
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,380
routers are the most busy mmm but but

1262
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:12,629
you also did read the text in here that

1263
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:15,000
says these should not be updated very

1264
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:17,640
often and in fact there's texas has

1265
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,310
basically do it at configuration time do

1266
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:24,690
you'll see do not it would be a bad idea

1267
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:27,359
to adjust these advertised values as a

1268
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:29,849
function of cpu load so are you saying

1269
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,910
the intent from your mind of the draft

1270
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:41,160
is simply to set these once from the

1271
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:43,979
receive end and not to change them how

1272
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:46,639
do you feel about that it doesn't change

1273
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:49,830
my point of view but it does mean that

1274
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,600
if you're yes if you're not going to do

1275
01:09:49,830 --> 01:10:16,410
dynamic signaling then this point is

1276
01:09:51,600 --> 01:10:19,449
moot just one second let's no more

1277
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:22,870
people at the line after the last person

1278
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:25,419
I agree that we want for convergence

1279
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:28,599
reasons for things to converge

1280
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:30,520
informally absolutely I don't think the

1281
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:36,429
right answer is to slow everything down

1282
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:43,120
to the least cannot comment and that was

1283
01:10:36,429 --> 01:10:45,429
not the point I was trying to make and

1284
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,920
to do that we actually have to have real

1285
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:51,400
active flow control and that kind of

1286
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:54,280
applies we have to have a control okay

1287
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,620
and way first do that patrol loop

1288
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:02,710
receiver has to give you some feedback

1289
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:04,210
on the state of the control so now I'm

1290
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:06,910
going to disagree with some of my

1291
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:08,620
co-authors here and say no actually

1292
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:10,750
those numbers need to change and they

1293
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:14,820
need to change pretty rapidly it looks

1294
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:17,199
just like a TCP received window okay

1295
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:22,420
that's that's lesson solution right

1296
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:24,610
watch the drops no no - I agree with

1297
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:26,320
Tony at this point that the problem is

1298
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:27,940
TCP is a point-to-point connection

1299
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,780
that's not what we're talking about here

1300
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:36,460
we're talking about flooding

1301
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:39,250
network-wide no no I'm saying a TCP

1302
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,900
connection is between node a and node B

1303
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,340
wherever however many hops they're

1304
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,500
separated in the network you're

1305
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,960
controlling the flow between these two

1306
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,820
endpoints only that's not what we're

1307
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,110
trying to do with flooding we're trying

1308
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,910
to get the flooding out to the whole

1309
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:57,309
network as fast as we can as

1310
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:59,380
consistently as we can from the point A

1311
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:01,449
to point B and you know neighbor to

1312
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,429
neighbor and use the bandwidth that

1313
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:06,940
we've got and use the CPU power we've

1314
01:12:03,429 --> 01:12:09,820
got so it seems like the way to do that

1315
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:10,839
is to have a local control loop running

1316
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:13,630
as quickly as possible

1317
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,969
now I'm gonna again go out on a branch

1318
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:18,850
and say I disagree with my co-authors I

1319
01:12:15,969 --> 01:12:23,080
think that this TOB should also be in

1320
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:26,110
the PSN peek packet okay so now when the

1321
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:30,040
LSP receiver has processed part of its

1322
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:33,040
input queue it can now send upstream say

1323
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:34,810
okay I've both

1324
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,970
just this much here are all the things

1325
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:38,740
that I'm a key and oh by the way here's

1326
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:43,030
why how much buffer space I've got left

1327
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:45,150
now that could be less than what has

1328
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:47,860
already incent

1329
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:50,769
so that's also thinking about the

1330
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:53,490
positive and negative reinforcement to

1331
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:53,490
the transmitter

1332
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:58,360
thank you

1333
01:12:54,970 --> 01:13:00,100
so again this is very interesting I want

1334
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,259
to point out I know we're out of time

1335
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,960
but you raising the point about

1336
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:07,840
point-to-point not having anything said

1337
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,510
about it in the ISO standard is I think

1338
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,240
why we're here because it was they were

1339
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:15,280
literally relegating this to the l2 and

1340
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,920
they were saying send it as fast as you

1341
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:20,769
want right and lt will take care of you

1342
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,350
and it isn't for us right and now we're

1343
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:25,210
here trying you know from both sides on

1344
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:26,620
the transmit or receive we're saying how

1345
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:29,950
can we speed this up because we've been

1346
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:33,370
using this broadcast minimum on the on

1347
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:36,730
the point-to-point link it's interesting

1348
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:38,740
I just want to point out that OSPF is it

1349
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:40,750
we'll discuss this more in the list OSPF

1350
01:13:38,740 --> 01:14:11,639
has never had anything mandated it's all

1351
01:13:40,750 --> 01:14:21,370
been implementation to send it to you I

1352
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:24,850
don't disagree but I disagree that we

1353
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:27,460
need to show that the same speed for for

1354
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:31,030
oranges or all neighbors I could find

1355
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:36,000
it's not work but we kind of hang some

1356
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:40,480
produced Aquino's like it's better to

1357
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:44,350
first trust in the ends of two issues is

1358
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,730
to delay series initially because the

1359
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:50,480
utility has to be fluid

1360
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:56,509
HDPE which are out of sea food good mmm

1361
01:14:50,480 --> 01:15:09,019
we just want to fast we can be fast in

1362
01:14:56,510 --> 01:15:12,230
different delay the point I want to

1363
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:14,780
emphasize is you and I fundamentally

1364
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:17,089
agree flooding is much lower than it

1365
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:31,610
needs to be today there's no

1366
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:35,210
disagreement about that now the the

1367
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:38,540
point I want to make is that flooding is

1368
01:15:35,210 --> 01:16:28,580
an is a network-wide parameter if I fled

1369
01:15:38,540 --> 01:16:30,440
slow on the way it worked I guess if

1370
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:32,600
everyone's gonna be here for the second

1371
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,759
session if we have you know when we run

1372
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:43,610
out of time later tonight we can all

1373
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:47,120
just sit around and talk about this very

1374
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:50,389
quick I'm coming in quite cold to this

1375
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:52,940
oh no no no SPF for a sexpert but I

1376
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:54,800
understand both sides points I think you

1377
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:57,530
have different into the same stick here

1378
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,750
you want to say solve the same problem

1379
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:01,389
and I think you

1380
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:03,130
give that thought either the sender

1381
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:04,570
could monitor acknowledgment or Foe

1382
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:06,790
controller or the receiver can provide

1383
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:08,139
feedback or perhaps both I think one

1384
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:11,019
thing that gets missed and you're

1385
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:14,530
conflating two points one is how do we

1386
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:17,380
control the point-to-point controlling

1387
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:20,710
rate and the other point which you keep

1388
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:22,540
coming to quite elegantly is in a link

1389
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:25,780
state routing protocol the critical

1390
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:27,460
thing is about the consistent view of

1391
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:30,849
the link state database across the

1392
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:33,190
entire network so if you want to speed

1393
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:35,470
up the propagation of that link state

1394
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:37,870
across the entire network that's almost

1395
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:40,720
a different parameter and needs a

1396
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:42,730
different method of speeding up than

1397
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:45,610
just great controlling your point

1398
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:48,419
winning they're both important and 33

1399
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:50,410
minutes milliseconds is too old a number

1400
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:55,320
that's something that there's those two

1401
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:57,519
points for you can't separate them okay

1402
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:59,469
okay it's on it's gonna go next we do

1403
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,350
have a plan for catching back up

1404
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:03,700
part of it is Tony had originally asked

1405
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:06,640
for five minutes for these and we gave

1406
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,929
ten so any any fee for each of them any

1407
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,720
help you can give us the other thing is

1408
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:13,720
we can push Peters last presentation to

1409
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:15,730
the next session because we we only have

1410
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:21,120
45 minutes allocated in the next session

1411
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:21,120
so Tony's gonna talk fast

1412
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:33,400
all right I've got two updates for you

1413
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:36,009
topology transient zones area

1414
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,429
abstraction and hierarchical ISS next

1415
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:40,510
slide please

1416
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:42,340
okay first apology transparent zones and

1417
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:44,800
airy abstraction as previously noted

1418
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:46,480
this is largely trying to accomplish the

1419
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,940
same thing we have completely different

1420
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:51,730
ways of doing things we at least have

1421
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:53,950
met and privately and have agreed we're

1422
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:56,860
going to collaborate we have started a

1423
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:59,080
document offline we do not have anything

1424
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:04,509
ready to present sorry

1425
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:07,000
okay next hierarchical ISS so we have

1426
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:10,000
some changes here we added support for

1427
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,489
flooding scopes there was a bug fix we

1428
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,090
needed more PDU types for LAN

1429
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:18,449
IHS that was just silly we added an

1430
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:23,230
explicit area identifier because

1431
01:19:18,449 --> 01:19:24,629
apparently nobody in in discussion was

1432
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:28,178
willing to actually deal with

1433
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:30,070
hierarchical in SAP allocation does

1434
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:34,090
anybody here remember what ends apps are

1435
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:35,230
oh good okay that's probably the right

1436
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,840
thing to do

1437
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:41,138
we welcome Les and Paul Wells as

1438
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:45,130
co-authors and we're again asking for a

1439
01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:48,760
working group adoption don't my

1440
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:52,749
apologies on this one it it the wrong

1441
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:55,360
versions of the draft this draft got

1442
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:56,889
included in the meeting materials and I

1443
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,730
didn't notice it so I was reading it on

1444
01:19:56,889 --> 01:20:05,460
the plane so sorry so we had a we had

1445
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:07,749
Lea offered last iqf by Tony's agenda to

1446
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:09,909
present all the reasons we would never

1447
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:12,340
want to actually deploy hierarchical

1448
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:14,138
link state routing and then I went and

1449
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:18,039
asked him for this if you know would you

1450
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:20,920
please present that and he said no so

1451
01:20:18,039 --> 01:20:30,909
that's pretty pretty bad I wish he would

1452
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:32,409
have I don't know what do you think what

1453
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,670
do you haven't really thought about

1454
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:35,638
working group adoption call I guess we

1455
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:39,489
can just ask the working group yeah yeah

1456
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:43,889
hopefully you know people will if you

1457
01:20:39,489 --> 01:20:48,280
have some trepidation regarding this

1458
01:20:43,889 --> 01:20:51,090
this this step forward to multiple

1459
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:53,739
levels please come forward

1460
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:55,389
yeah I mean so the reason I'm sort of

1461
01:20:53,739 --> 01:20:57,339
having in Hine right is because I don't

1462
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:59,260
think people are paying attention right

1463
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,639
and and the some people who do are

1464
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,269
paying attention are saying this is a

1465
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,010
bad idea

1466
01:21:01,269 --> 01:21:06,820
but then they're not willing to get up

1467
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:09,280
and show us why so I just don't want to

1468
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:11,110
jump jump the gun here and get and adopt

1469
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,849
something that then later we get

1470
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:14,589
somebody coming in and saying what the

1471
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:20,170
hell are you working on this floor right

1472
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:23,079
this is a crazy idea Rick Taylor just

1473
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:25,019
very good question have the potential

1474
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:27,299
use faces for this being documented a

1475
01:21:25,019 --> 01:21:29,639
is it not over the drop I haven't read

1476
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,170
the draft yeah I think that Tony's got

1477
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:34,710
it in there basically saying you know

1478
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:38,429
the obvious ones Rafael will arrest all

1479
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:41,760
those use cases contentious not very the

1480
01:21:38,429 --> 01:21:43,170
the main use case is called scale we've

1481
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,510
got this thing called the Internet

1482
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:48,210
we've got domains they're busting out of

1483
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:50,760
their seams for many many years people

1484
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:52,769
have been doing strange things they've

1485
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,440
got an IG P running in North America

1486
01:21:52,769 --> 01:21:57,900
they've got an IG P running in Europe

1487
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:01,169
and they paste things together at the

1488
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:03,629
edges or they run a distance vector

1489
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:07,440
between the two you know all sorts of

1490
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:08,789
strange things happen what we're finally

1491
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,610
trying to do is get around to doing the

1492
01:22:08,789 --> 01:22:14,610
work of adding additional hierarchies so

1493
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:18,749
that we can continue to scale when the

1494
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:20,610
protocols were initially designed these

1495
01:22:18,749 --> 01:22:25,010
kind of scale numbers were out of the

1496
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:25,009
design scope and it's time to add

1497
01:22:35,519 --> 01:22:48,269
I Tony 20 PG Reaper so since you

1498
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:51,900
publicly tried to shame best to Susan so

1499
01:22:48,269 --> 01:22:54,420
if you really trust in the reasoning you

1500
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:57,119
can access it by reading up to peel an

1501
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:59,849
ice pack and take why we didn't yeah

1502
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:01,889
right that's where if it's been done and

1503
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:04,920
why we didn't build the BGP

1504
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:07,260
on top of the areas to deny areas which

1505
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:09,300
would have been necessary if we wouldn't

1506
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:11,429
have a crank back the only way we could

1507
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:13,139
avoid that we had the crank back and the

1508
01:23:11,429 --> 01:23:16,289
crank back allowed us to hadn't screwed

1509
01:23:13,139 --> 01:23:17,940
up back off and find a peaceful path but

1510
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:18,420
you don't have an IP you simply black

1511
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:21,268
hole

1512
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:26,909
okay so there's like meant I once sent

1513
01:23:21,269 --> 01:23:29,639
this thing thanks so hopefully in your

1514
01:23:26,909 --> 01:23:31,739
IGP you don't have policy restrictions a

1515
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:34,829
cause pass to be invalid and therefore

1516
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:39,178
you don't need crank back and therefore

1517
01:23:34,829 --> 01:23:41,518
this should just work yes all comments

1518
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:43,260
about suboptimal paths because of

1519
01:23:41,519 --> 01:23:51,480
abstraction yes those are well-known

1520
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:53,039
stipulated yeah yes yes the Tony was

1521
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:55,259
talking to me about it and he said also

1522
01:23:53,039 --> 01:24:00,018
there might be some issues with when you

1523
01:23:55,260 --> 01:24:02,280
learn where level 1 level 2 if you get

1524
01:24:00,019 --> 01:24:06,749
why am i dropping it you know you cut in

1525
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:08,789
half right no partition area partition

1526
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:15,809
is a separate problem and yes that's

1527
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:17,340
something that we can talk about no cuz

1528
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:19,769
you're just going to make everything

1529
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:23,280
hierarchical right so anything you do to

1530
01:24:19,769 --> 01:24:26,280
repair a l1 partition via l2 you would

1531
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:29,009
do to heal and l2 partition via l3 I

1532
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:35,099
mean the whole point is to have some

1533
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:36,690
same mechanisms at every level the

1534
01:24:35,099 --> 01:24:39,030
author's asking for working group

1535
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:44,728
adoption how many people have read and

1536
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:48,099
thought about this work I gotta say

1537
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:52,030
again I read the wrong version

1538
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:54,190
and I figured out why I somebody asked

1539
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:58,330
Tony to rename his draft to have LSR in

1540
01:24:54,190 --> 01:25:02,950
it and the agenda still referenced the

1541
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:06,970
old one okay so there was a decent

1542
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:08,110
number of people how many people how

1543
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:12,720
many people would like to see this

1544
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:16,000
become working your document there's a

1545
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:17,650
lot less but okay is that how many

1546
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,220
people have been influenced by me being

1547
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:25,259
negative in raising their hand okay

1548
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:27,190
there's a few all right sorry okay so

1549
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:31,950
all right why don't we just put it to

1550
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:36,240
the list and we'll just see how it goes

1551
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:39,280
okay thanks Don so we have less

1552
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:41,230
volatility yeah

1553
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,179
just well this is coming up I just like

1554
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:47,589
to encourage everybody not to read the

1555
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:52,990
one that's to read the one that has LSR

1556
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:56,700
in in the name not just lead this is Lee

1557
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:56,700
LSR instead of the right

1558
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:24,650
that work but I don't know I'm like

1559
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:37,190
editing this is that because you know

1560
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:45,138
I'm going to give you grief it's but

1561
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:46,598
it's like Google editing present here ok

1562
01:26:45,139 --> 01:26:51,650
next slide please

1563
01:26:46,599 --> 01:26:59,960
this will be pretty short um what did we

1564
01:26:51,650 --> 01:27:04,638
change the not that short I'm trying I'm

1565
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:07,250
trying ok it's just a quick this has

1566
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,960
been presented several times before what

1567
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:11,060
motivated this draft we actually had

1568
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,820
some some real world interoperability

1569
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:18,080
problems and how people decided whether

1570
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:21,980
to reject an LSB in its entirety and we

1571
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:23,869
needed to clarify what you do hey if you

1572
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:26,150
got an unknown TLV or TLV that's

1573
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:28,759
malformed you can't use the TLV

1574
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:31,159
obviously but you cannot throw away the

1575
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:33,199
LSB if you throw away the LSP then we

1576
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:34,839
got inconsistent LSP databases in the

1577
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:38,019
network and we're never going to work

1578
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:40,580
there were some issues with bridges

1579
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:43,610
anyways that these are the the reasons

1580
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:45,730
that we wrote the draft next slide we

1581
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:48,589
got some comments from Brunel thank you

1582
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:50,199
largely editorial but they improved the

1583
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:52,909
quality of the document we put them in

1584
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:55,699
there was a last call started on June

1585
01:27:52,909 --> 01:27:57,589
12th and there was a considerable amount

1586
01:27:55,699 --> 01:28:06,080
of support no objections voice blabbed

1587
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:07,500
it was never declared finished this is

1588
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:19,019
where this is where you get

1589
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:21,540
say something okay okay so on the

1590
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:23,340
assumption that that working group

1591
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:25,470
adoption has actually occurred even

1592
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,490
though officially has not the authors

1593
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:33,570
believe we're done

1594
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:35,250
and we'd like to ask for last call adopt

1595
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:37,679
it and take it through one cycle before

1596
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:39,630
the last call just one okay I'm just

1597
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:52,620
making the point you know we don't have

1598
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:54,720
any feedback you know kidding aside the

1599
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:56,910
point the authors are trying to make is

1600
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,340
we're done we don't have any outstanding

1601
01:28:56,910 --> 01:29:00,660
comments so from our point of view

1602
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:09,050
there's there's no additional work

1603
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:09,050
planned but you're hiding it well

1604
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:28,020
somebody spilled coffee on my laptop and

1605
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:30,330
I got it restored but they told me I

1606
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:33,900
shouldn't have local folders so I was

1607
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:36,450
not to restore the Mac library and I had

1608
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:46,950
all my nail it my IETF mail in my local

1609
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:49,410
folders so I lost them all I actually

1610
01:29:46,950 --> 01:30:00,120
had a new laptop restored with most

1611
01:29:49,410 --> 01:30:02,460
stuff since we nap hours okay normally

1612
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:07,290
speed up check from Cisco I'm going to

1613
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:09,440
give a quick update on the ice is our e6

1614
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:12,260
extension next slide please

1615
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:14,659
so the

1616
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:21,019
the draft became a working document so

1617
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:23,959
it's been adopted it's a good news so

1618
01:30:21,019 --> 01:30:27,289
one of the things that we clarified in

1619
01:30:23,959 --> 01:30:29,780
the draft is that we explicitly said so

1620
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:32,030
so what we sought the draft says is that

1621
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:34,489
the algal zero locator should be

1622
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:37,639
advertised as a prefix the reason is

1623
01:30:34,489 --> 01:30:38,928
that we want things to work in a network

1624
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:41,719
where the router is which you don't

1625
01:30:38,929 --> 01:30:44,300
support it sorry six which is obvious

1626
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:47,150
but it never really said what do we do

1627
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:49,789
is the algorithm other than zero how do

1628
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:51,619
we advertise so we basically put a

1629
01:30:49,789 --> 01:30:54,110
sentence in a table saying we should not

1630
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:56,839
advertised these as a prefixes but only

1631
01:30:54,110 --> 01:31:01,400
as a locators the reason is that if you

1632
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:03,559
if you have an algo X in the network you

1633
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,420
really only want the routers which are

1634
01:31:03,559 --> 01:31:07,699
participating in that algo and is

1635
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:09,889
supporting the algo to actually see that

1636
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:12,199
prefix so what we said is they should

1637
01:31:09,889 --> 01:31:14,510
not be advertised as a prefix but only

1638
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:20,209
as the locators so that's a small

1639
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:23,900
codification next slide so we introduced

1640
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:25,300
an optional sub T LV for advertising the

1641
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:29,420
the seat structure

1642
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:31,340
yes bunch of blank fields which is a

1643
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:33,380
locator block node and function and

1644
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:37,070
arguments where we basically describe

1645
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:39,650
the structure of the seat this is an

1646
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:45,039
optional sub sub TLV of the NC table

1647
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:49,789
theory and and X or LAN and exit sub TLB

1648
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:52,728
next slide and one other thing that I

1649
01:31:49,789 --> 01:31:55,429
want to propose here in last ITF and in

1650
01:31:52,729 --> 01:31:59,780
in a previous version of this of the

1651
01:31:55,429 --> 01:32:03,019
draft we introduced an a bit as as a bit

1652
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:07,509
in the in the locator black teal flag

1653
01:32:03,019 --> 01:32:10,039
field but after discussing with some

1654
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:13,550
people we thought maybe we should move

1655
01:32:10,039 --> 01:32:16,429
really the a flag to the prefix reach

1656
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:20,840
ability attribute flags so it is also

1657
01:32:16,429 --> 01:32:23,360
used outside of the SR v6 as it seems to

1658
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:25,520
be a good idea to know that prefixes and

1659
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:29,240
anycast prefix

1660
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:31,880
and we do support these flags attribute

1661
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:34,940
flex under the locator TLV so unless

1662
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:39,700
anyone implemented this we would propose

1663
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:39,700
to move these to the attribute flex tle

1664
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:49,820
so ambit and it is different and it

1665
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:56,060
means that I'm a node right that she's

1666
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:58,450
advertising yeah but it still if

1667
01:32:56,060 --> 01:33:00,950
something is any cost you may want to be

1668
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:03,920
sure this isn't any country fix because

1669
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:05,720
not saying it's an not introducing or

1670
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,980
not including n big doesn't mean instant

1671
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:11,900
any cost so that so having a none bit

1672
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:13,730
means it is not any cars but not having

1673
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:16,280
n bits that doesn't mean it is any cost

1674
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:36,799
so we want to explicitly know this isn't

1675
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:39,469
any costly fix so here in the inter

1676
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,360
located we want to know and we don't

1677
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:45,230
want to use to sit from the locator if

1678
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:48,320
it is forty LFA for example right in the

1679
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:52,459
prefix what if you don't have any prefix

1680
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:55,280
with your hand flag right I mean look

1681
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:57,590
it's I'm not saying this is a must we

1682
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,469
just felt this a flag would probably

1683
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:02,030
deserve to go to the more generic subtly

1684
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:16,340
and the subtly is available under the

1685
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:20,259
locator so so are you saying between if

1686
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:20,260
they are leaked or distributed or

1687
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:24,590
mmm-hmm but then we have the specific

1688
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:28,010
flag which are saying this is leaked

1689
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:36,659
prefix right so it's not in any cost we

1690
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:40,900
fix anymore yeah exactly

1691
01:34:36,659 --> 01:34:42,549
so I'll actually what I plan to do I put

1692
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:44,920
this question on the list and see

1693
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:48,699
because if anyone has implemented a flag

1694
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,739
in the locator Flags field we don't want

1695
01:34:48,699 --> 01:34:54,489
to cause problems but if not I think it

1696
01:34:50,739 --> 01:34:58,629
would be worse to move it okay

1697
01:34:54,489 --> 01:35:00,940
next slide alright so you have multiple

1698
01:34:58,630 --> 01:35:01,480
implementations I guess we need to work

1699
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:13,259
on it

1700
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:13,259
any other suggestions comments okay

1701
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:20,280
remember I think I agree that the

1702
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:22,750
anycast flag is more a generic prefix

1703
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:31,989
attribute rather than being specific to

1704
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:34,179
our v6 I'd like to point out do to Tony

1705
01:35:31,989 --> 01:35:36,419
and less being quick we're right back on

1706
01:35:34,179 --> 01:35:36,420
time

1707
01:35:47,309 --> 01:35:56,769
okay so I just been mentioned and

1708
01:35:51,989 --> 01:35:59,968
previously by AC I'm going to just give

1709
01:35:56,769 --> 01:36:03,010
a quick update on the entropy the label

1710
01:35:59,969 --> 01:36:05,650
capability and the depth signaling using

1711
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:13,979
eye size and no SPF so you can go next

1712
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:17,768
slide so I'm gonna cover okay

1713
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:20,440
so what yeah it's just I'm covering both

1714
01:36:17,769 --> 01:36:23,110
of the data so what we did is originally

1715
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:24,699
the entropy label capability was

1716
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:27,959
advertised as a node

1717
01:36:24,699 --> 01:36:32,169
attribute in the router capability TLV

1718
01:36:27,959 --> 01:36:34,239
we moved it out out of the router

1719
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:36,550
capability theory and we put this under

1720
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:38,228
the prefix advertise name the reason is

1721
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:41,199
that the routers may not know the

1722
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:44,260
identity of the of the prefix originator

1723
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:45,999
in the remote area or a domain and even

1724
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:49,800
if they if they know they may not know

1725
01:36:45,999 --> 01:36:53,530
the the capabilities of that originator

1726
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:56,079
okay next slide so they basically

1727
01:36:53,530 --> 01:36:58,179
introduced a new bit in a prefix

1728
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:01,119
attribute flexib TLD which we call an

1729
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:03,239
ELC bit and what we said is there are

1730
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:05,679
some rules that if the router supports

1731
01:37:03,239 --> 01:37:09,339
Els on all of the line cards it should

1732
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:13,389
set this ELC flag on every local prefix

1733
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:15,280
it advertise if the router has multiple

1734
01:37:13,389 --> 01:37:18,010
line cards the router must not announce

1735
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:21,219
the ELC for any prefix that is locally

1736
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:23,019
attached if it is capable if it is not

1737
01:37:21,219 --> 01:37:25,869
capable of processing years and all of

1738
01:37:23,019 --> 01:37:27,909
you all of its line cards the leaked

1739
01:37:25,869 --> 01:37:30,308
prefixes should preserve the ELC

1740
01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:33,369
signaling so we should do that during

1741
01:37:30,309 --> 01:37:35,920
the redistribution so this way we can

1742
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:39,159
get in a way you know best way we can

1743
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,690
really do the DLC support between the

1744
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:43,959
areas and the domains and that was the

1745
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:46,509
purpose of the move from the capability

1746
01:37:43,959 --> 01:37:49,019
subtly or capability theory to the

1747
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:52,040
prefix advertisement so it's not

1748
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:59,180
perfect but this is the best we can do

1749
01:37:52,040 --> 01:38:02,010
okay next slide so the the depths

1750
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:04,680
advertisement that didn't really change

1751
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:08,010
it stays as a new MSD type in an Odom is

1752
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:09,600
d-sub TLV and basically fir alder has a

1753
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:11,670
multiple n cards with so different

1754
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,770
capabilities of reading the maximum

1755
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:15,660
label stack Napster Artemis advertise to

1756
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:17,250
the smallest one this is the rule that

1757
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:19,950
has been there even in a previous

1758
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:24,690
version of the of the draft I can go

1759
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:26,190
next slide so similar similarly we did

1760
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,089
the same thing in the u.s. beer we

1761
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:28,830
remove it

1762
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:30,870
the ELC signaling from the router

1763
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:34,019
information Alice a b-movie to the

1764
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:36,660
prefix advertisement so in OS baby - it

1765
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:40,230
is it is part of the extended prefix tre

1766
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:43,139
you know sp3 it's a new flag in the OS

1767
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:45,330
baby 3 prefix option and the same rules

1768
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:50,670
has been mentioned for I say as applies

1769
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:54,090
here to nxi here again this hasn't

1770
01:38:50,670 --> 01:39:01,110
changed we have a new MST type same rule

1771
01:38:54,090 --> 01:39:31,050
sizing I sighs so I guess this draft is

1772
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:32,490
now probably close to just leaking yeah

1773
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:35,040
now you have on the prefix when you leak

1774
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:44,370
right already stupid how else can you do

1775
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:46,850
it so I completely agree with the new

1776
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:49,860
proposal doing it as a prefix attribute

1777
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:51,900
but I wanted to ask think again or

1778
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:54,420
question about removing it as a node

1779
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:57,440
attribute there are some applications

1780
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:59,880
that traffic engineering and all of that

1781
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:02,848
which would benefit from learning the

1782
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:06,539
ear capability from the

1783
01:40:02,849 --> 01:40:08,519
node otherwise now I have to you know

1784
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:10,709
get I have the node but I have to look

1785
01:40:08,519 --> 01:40:12,449
for some specific prefix in there

1786
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:16,760
look at that actually two and then

1787
01:40:12,449 --> 01:40:19,768
figure out come I don't disagree but

1788
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:21,929
question question is they want to have

1789
01:40:19,769 --> 01:40:24,559
two ways of signaling the same thing and

1790
01:40:21,929 --> 01:40:44,609
I guess people would say probably not

1791
01:40:24,559 --> 01:40:46,769
but I understand this has been part of

1792
01:40:44,609 --> 01:40:48,659
the discussion which we had and it goes

1793
01:40:46,769 --> 01:40:54,809
on the list so I guess we closed that

1794
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:58,978
this is the best we can do you know SPF

1795
01:40:54,809 --> 01:41:02,159
the router ID is not necessarily but you

1796
01:40:58,979 --> 01:41:05,489
thought you'd better do trap most most

1797
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:12,449
practically which means 99.9 percent it

1798
01:41:05,489 --> 01:41:13,709
is very typically is always yeah so I

1799
01:41:12,449 --> 01:41:20,909
don't think that would be an issue

1800
01:41:13,709 --> 01:41:24,320
anyway it doesn't if you do it

1801
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:29,579
advertise a ceiling bill again er LD

1802
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:38,549
doesn't that imply that you support yeah

1803
01:41:29,579 --> 01:41:41,759
but as soon as you are so you could you

1804
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:44,820
could you could you could you could

1805
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,760
definitely if you wanted it's for the

1806
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:53,280
node level you could just advertise your

1807
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:56,099
ERL that's her name was D other thing

1808
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,349
was again image to support kittens gonna

1809
01:41:56,099 --> 01:42:01,139
add the BGP LS rather than queuing

1810
01:41:58,349 --> 01:42:03,840
another yet another bt pls short draft

1811
01:42:01,139 --> 01:42:11,059
on the IDR queue we certainly welcome

1812
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:11,059
this contribution even better

1813
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:16,139
okay and go to the next one

1814
01:42:39,849 --> 01:42:50,659
all right so he's an update on the

1815
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:53,329
flicks Al Gore aft so originally when we

1816
01:42:50,659 --> 01:42:57,438
the draft it was written in a way that

1817
01:42:53,329 --> 01:43:00,860
we specified the how the Flex I'll go

1818
01:42:57,439 --> 01:43:03,619
forwarding works in the SR MPLS data

1819
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:05,630
plane and then for any other data planes

1820
01:43:03,619 --> 01:43:07,549
we said it's up to the you know that

1821
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:08,840
data playing on that application how did

1822
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:12,229
I want to use the outcome of the

1823
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:15,229
calculation we still keep the same thing

1824
01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:17,139
but we led the SRB six data plane

1825
01:43:15,229 --> 01:43:20,539
there's a new section which describes

1826
01:43:17,139 --> 01:43:23,840
how does this work in an SRE six

1827
01:43:20,539 --> 01:43:26,539
environment to make it very very short

1828
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,489
here and you can can read the draft but

1829
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:30,320
basically the necessary six the locator

1830
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:33,110
itself is attached to a topology and the

1831
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:35,478
algorithm so the locator itself has a

1832
01:43:33,110 --> 01:43:38,749
notion of the algorithm and that's how

1833
01:43:35,479 --> 01:43:40,939
the four running is being done so we

1834
01:43:38,749 --> 01:43:44,570
added the new section and we also added

1835
01:43:40,939 --> 01:43:47,300
whatever it was appropriate the DSRV six

1836
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:51,969
data playing statements all over the

1837
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:51,969
text next slide please

1838
01:43:55,719 --> 01:44:02,479
okay so the initial draft said that we

1839
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:05,329
can do flex our optimization inside an

1840
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:07,130
area and then between the areas or

1841
01:44:05,329 --> 01:44:09,590
between the domains it's up to the

1842
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:12,650
controller to figure out what is the

1843
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:14,959
best path overall because as we do the

1844
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:16,699
calculation which is area bound we can

1845
01:44:14,959 --> 01:44:19,729
only find a flex alga based paths inside

1846
01:44:16,699 --> 01:44:21,678
the area so just giving an example if

1847
01:44:19,729 --> 01:44:25,459
you have these four routers I want to go

1848
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:27,739
from r1 to r4 and I have the IGP matrix

1849
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:30,679
of ten everywhere and then the the green

1850
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:33,589
numbers are Easter delay when I lick the

1851
01:44:30,679 --> 01:44:37,639
prefix from right left r1 is going to

1852
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:40,070
see that it has delay of 100 to get to

1853
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:41,809
the prefix with the metric of ten which

1854
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:45,469
is being advertised from r2 so his

1855
01:44:41,809 --> 01:44:48,650
metric is 110 the same the other path

1856
01:44:45,469 --> 01:44:51,050
would be 210 going to r3 so he's going

1857
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:54,848
to pig r2 but overall and to end the

1858
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:58,829
Tila is better to go the the bottom path

1859
01:44:54,849 --> 01:45:00,809
but because we didn't have a white

1860
01:44:58,829 --> 01:45:02,728
signal the flags I'll go metric in the

1861
01:45:00,809 --> 01:45:04,559
prefix we couldn't really optimize this

1862
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:06,689
and we said well you can do this by

1863
01:45:04,559 --> 01:45:08,159
controller but it looks like people

1864
01:45:06,689 --> 01:45:10,199
would like to use this without the

1865
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:13,339
controller so we are trying to solve

1866
01:45:10,199 --> 01:45:16,919
this problem here and next slide please

1867
01:45:13,339 --> 01:45:19,169
so obviously the way we can solve it is

1868
01:45:16,919 --> 01:45:22,559
that we introduce the per flex alga

1869
01:45:19,169 --> 01:45:24,449
metric we don't think we need this to be

1870
01:45:22,559 --> 01:45:27,209
advertised with the prefix inside the

1871
01:45:24,449 --> 01:45:30,928
area this is mostly useful when we leak

1872
01:45:27,209 --> 01:45:35,358
or redistribute the flags alga prefixes

1873
01:45:30,929 --> 01:45:39,269
and you know the labels or locators but

1874
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:43,499
we really want to keep the metric which

1875
01:45:39,269 --> 01:45:47,039
has to be the optimization in place so

1876
01:45:43,499 --> 01:45:49,679
we can calculate n 2 and us now

1877
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:52,259
obviously we cannot just put the metric

1878
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,089
in the prefix advertisement and start to

1879
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:57,359
use it because we need to understand

1880
01:45:54,089 --> 01:45:59,969
that everybody who is doing the

1881
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:01,800
calculation uses the same thing so why

1882
01:45:59,969 --> 01:46:03,419
introducing the metric we also need to

1883
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:04,949
introduce something in the Flex alga

1884
01:46:03,419 --> 01:46:07,589
definition which would say we want to

1885
01:46:04,949 --> 01:46:08,358
use this metric and that is the next

1886
01:46:07,589 --> 01:46:12,689
slide

1887
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:14,849
so we introduce the new sub theory of

1888
01:46:12,689 --> 01:46:17,729
the Flex or the definition theory which

1889
01:46:14,849 --> 01:46:20,459
is the the definition flags we introduce

1890
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:23,519
one flag which is an unplug and acts

1891
01:46:20,459 --> 01:46:27,389
like an ant like says that when the

1892
01:46:23,519 --> 01:46:29,789
prefix alga specific flag raga specific

1893
01:46:27,389 --> 01:46:32,789
metric is used or advertised in the

1894
01:46:29,789 --> 01:46:35,339
prefix we must use it if it is not there

1895
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:37,858
we refer revert back to the standard IGP

1896
01:46:35,339 --> 01:46:40,589
metric so that's the definition and

1897
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:42,149
everybody needs to basically agree to

1898
01:46:40,589 --> 01:46:45,570
this definition and understand it before

1899
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:48,119
we can get the consistent calculation

1900
01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:50,249
results so it's similarly defined for

1901
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:53,098
SPF and there is a registry for those

1902
01:46:50,249 --> 01:46:56,209
bits which are IGP agnostic this is like

1903
01:46:53,099 --> 01:47:00,120
a common registry defined in a jar

1904
01:46:56,209 --> 01:47:03,210
ok next slide please and this is

1905
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:05,099
the the Dialga metric basically said

1906
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:08,010
vert eyes as a sub theory of the prefix

1907
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:10,170
which ability theories and it's just a

1908
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:18,900
little bit metric value and similarly

1909
01:47:10,170 --> 01:48:02,340
define in OSPF so if you have any

1910
01:47:18,900 --> 01:48:04,940
comments questions on those changes note

1911
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:08,850
that we have the is is draft bits

1912
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:15,980
definer did on the RFC cue for the

1913
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:19,860
equivalent function in io size yeah

1914
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:23,870
thanks AC so yes we have the highest as

1915
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:27,150
one it's in the RFC editor queue got a

1916
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:31,190
request use case for doing the same with

1917
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:35,099
OSPF and that's where we have this draft

1918
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:37,410
to go to the next one so I think the

1919
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:39,660
problem statement is known or well

1920
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:45,200
understood but just kind of going over

1921
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:48,150
it again OSPF runs over layer three lag

1922
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:52,040
interfaces and for certain in certain

1923
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:54,960
deployments there's a use cases for

1924
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:57,420
performing either some kind of a am

1925
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:01,470
verification of the underlying member

1926
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:04,710
links or doing some kind of a traffic

1927
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:08,330
engineering steering or specific member

1928
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:12,999
links instead of doing the hashing and

1929
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:16,139
in order to enable these use cases

1930
01:49:12,999 --> 01:49:20,409
there is a requirement that member links

1931
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:24,929
actually get described and exported as

1932
01:49:20,409 --> 01:49:26,888
part of the OSPF topology advertisements

1933
01:49:24,929 --> 01:49:31,179
next one

1934
01:49:26,889 --> 01:49:33,459
so what's proposed in the draft is that

1935
01:49:31,179 --> 01:49:36,820
when this use case is required or when

1936
01:49:33,459 --> 01:49:41,280
this thing feature is enabled that OSPF

1937
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:44,139
router actually describes the layer to

1938
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:46,900
bundle layer to members of that bundle

1939
01:49:44,139 --> 01:49:50,139
interface so it's basically the

1940
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:53,379
description of the link and some

1941
01:49:50,139 --> 01:49:56,459
specific attributes of that link and

1942
01:49:53,380 --> 01:50:00,429
this is applies to both OSP of v2 and v3

1943
01:49:56,459 --> 01:50:03,280
now do you thing to note is that this

1944
01:50:00,429 --> 01:50:05,889
does not change the OSPF route

1945
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:08,139
computation or SPF computation so it's

1946
01:50:05,889 --> 01:50:14,610
you know some information which is

1947
01:50:08,139 --> 01:50:20,650
getting advertised out why OSPF next one

1948
01:50:14,610 --> 01:50:22,989
so how is this done so there is a new l2

1949
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:26,558
bundle member attributes up TLB that we

1950
01:50:22,989 --> 01:50:29,650
have introduced in Westby of v2 this

1951
01:50:26,559 --> 01:50:32,800
would be the under the sub TLV of the

1952
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:36,159
extended linked a link TLB in the

1953
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:40,479
extended link opaque LSA and in OSPF

1954
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:44,199
it's part of the new extended Alice's so

1955
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:46,900
it's a extended router LSA and this is a

1956
01:50:44,199 --> 01:50:49,058
sub TLB of the router link LSA which in

1957
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:54,429
both cases they actually describe the

1958
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:57,130
layer 3 link so that's a clearly

1959
01:50:54,429 --> 01:50:59,050
proposed proposal and mainly it's the

1960
01:50:57,130 --> 01:51:01,570
descriptor that lists scripter is a link

1961
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:05,229
local identifier you know something like

1962
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:08,978
an if' index perhaps and then we have

1963
01:51:05,229 --> 01:51:11,469
sub tlvs which describe the attribute of

1964
01:51:08,979 --> 01:51:14,199
this specific member link so if there

1965
01:51:11,469 --> 01:51:17,349
are multiple member links you would see

1966
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:21,980
I know more than one instance of this

1967
01:51:17,349 --> 01:51:28,010
sub TLV under the link

1968
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:29,900
next one so there are no new new link

1969
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:32,630
attribute sub sub tlvs

1970
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:35,330
defined for this particular layer-2

1971
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:38,750
member types the idea is that would

1972
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:41,630
reuse the existing till means that we

1973
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:45,290
have for layer 3 just that they would be

1974
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:47,780
included under under this one and they

1975
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:51,620
would be associated with the l2 bundle

1976
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:55,219
member the draft goes talks about the

1977
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:58,489
ones which are applicable for layer 2

1978
01:51:55,219 --> 01:52:01,010
like adjacency said or the maximum link

1979
01:51:58,489 --> 01:52:04,968
bandwidth and then it lists others like

1980
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:07,460
you know addresses and identifiers which

1981
01:52:04,969 --> 01:52:14,630
are not really applicable for layer 2

1982
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:18,620
interface next one so this is mainly you

1983
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:20,330
know just OSPF encoding z' for draft

1984
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:23,000
which is already eius eius dropped is

1985
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:26,830
already arab said être but we'd like to

1986
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,830
request a review and feedback

1987
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:43,280
yes so i didn't list down all the things

1988
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:49,400
but in the draft yes they are marked as

1989
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:52,099
applicable and it's kind of funny the

1990
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:54,139
draft says it's not going to that's not

1991
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:55,910
a scope and then later on you see that

1992
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:58,969
you might want to remove that to say

1993
01:52:55,910 --> 01:53:01,670
what things are at okay so maybe there's

1994
01:52:58,969 --> 01:53:03,679
some to mover we were debating one way

1995
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:05,719
other but then V of X the draft

1996
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:08,179
explicitly lists which is applicable and

1997
01:53:05,719 --> 01:53:12,860
which is not so I would I will go back

1998
01:53:08,179 --> 01:53:15,440
and correct the test and we can thank

1999
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:19,190
the C camp working group for this we

2000
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:21,949
have arbitrary level nesting of subtlety

2001
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:23,928
of ease so we really only have top level

2002
01:53:21,949 --> 01:53:26,000
T of these and sub t Olie's that can be

2003
01:53:23,929 --> 01:53:28,610
nested at arbitrary levels yes in some

2004
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,489
cases so you said sub T all these we

2005
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:34,509
shouldn't use the term sub sub tlvs or

2006
01:53:31,489 --> 01:53:34,509
sub sub sub t

2007
01:53:36,420 --> 01:54:24,040
by cog on the bank next to maybe the BFD

2008
01:54:12,969 --> 01:54:26,850
one I don't know if I can choose yeah

2009
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:31,830
thanks so this is a follow on update

2010
01:54:26,850 --> 01:54:35,620
this office was presented at in Prague

2011
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:40,630
about those PF working with strict mode

2012
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:42,930
BFD go to the next one so quick recap on

2013
01:54:40,630 --> 01:54:45,160
what the draft does so it's a mechanism

2014
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:47,760
we're trying to standardize something

2015
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:51,969
which many implementations do already

2016
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:54,820
which is want to run BFD to monitor

2017
01:54:51,969 --> 01:54:57,280
liveness and at the same time do not

2018
01:54:54,820 --> 01:55:03,670
want to bring up the OSP of adjacency

2019
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:07,330
until BFD sessions up so there is an ISS

2020
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:13,840
RFC which does something similar it with

2021
01:55:07,330 --> 01:55:15,880
for Isis go to the next one so just a

2022
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:19,900
very quick reminder how it is done it's

2023
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:23,469
really we introduced a new flag be bit

2024
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:25,809
flag in the LLS extended options and

2025
01:55:23,469 --> 01:55:29,980
flags this is part of the hello messages

2026
01:55:25,810 --> 01:55:32,560
and this is how a neighbor router can

2027
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:38,290
inform its neighbor that it wants to you

2028
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:40,930
know operate in this strict mode and the

2029
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:43,360
way of this session is requested right

2030
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:46,000
when the new neighbor is detected the

2031
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:48,040
draft talks about the FSM changes it's

2032
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,140
really that

2033
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:53,530
the neighbor FSM is held in the init

2034
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:57,100
state until the BFD session is up so we

2035
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:59,500
do not ask for you know what progress

2036
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:01,989
the FSM until the BFD session is up and

2037
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:04,870
once the bf DS up beat goes on to the to

2038
01:56:01,989 --> 01:56:08,889
a and X started states so that's in a

2039
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:13,090
nutshell the summer the proposal next

2040
01:56:08,890 --> 01:56:16,420
one so these are the updates first thing

2041
01:56:13,090 --> 01:56:18,820
is we change the title from OSPF DF

2042
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:21,520
district mode to OSPF strict mode for

2043
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:24,160
BFD got a lot of feedback saying that

2044
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:26,860
which correctly said that this is not

2045
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:29,800
really a PFD mechanism it's always OSPF

2046
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:32,170
mechanism and then there was some

2047
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:35,380
feedback on the need to indicate that

2048
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:38,760
for graceful restart scenarios because

2049
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:41,950
we have this additional BFD

2050
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:43,900
establishment thing we need to you know

2051
01:56:41,950 --> 01:56:46,420
indicate that so the timers need to

2052
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:53,670
allow for this especially in a scale

2053
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:53,670
scenario perhaps Tony you had a question

2054
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:08,560
to be if the new site comes up why do

2055
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:09,910
you even need this signal we have the

2056
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,470
proper eye the problem is absolutely

2057
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:14,349
valid right you want a lot of config

2058
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:17,200
saying until I get the PFD are no SPF

2059
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:19,210
but you don't sell any hellos until you

2060
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:21,400
BF decide is up the other side cannot

2061
01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:23,110
come up right it does matter what both

2062
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:24,429
sides have configured one side

2063
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:35,799
configuring doing that is already

2064
01:57:24,430 --> 01:57:37,570
forcing the behavior so hellos do need

2065
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:45,070
to be sent otherwise you do not detect

2066
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:46,989
the neighbor if you do not detect I we

2067
01:57:45,070 --> 01:57:48,849
do not even learn who the neighbor is

2068
01:57:46,989 --> 01:57:52,379
and who to set up the day of the session

2069
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:52,380
and let until we see the hello

2070
01:57:58,510 --> 01:58:05,150
okay and the last bit I think we can go

2071
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:09,650
to the next slide so we have OSPF v3

2072
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:12,920
multi address family so we can have ipv4

2073
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:16,670
instance routing supported by OSP of you

2074
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:18,860
three now in this mechanism what happens

2075
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:22,190
is all the hellos are done with link

2076
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:25,280
local ipv6 addresses but because it's

2077
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:27,230
for the ipv4 address family we need the

2078
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:31,280
session establishment has to be for the

2079
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:35,138
ipv4 neighbour address and we don't know

2080
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:40,280
this when we are operating OSP of u3 so

2081
01:58:35,139 --> 01:58:43,789
next slide so there is a new TLV in

2082
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:45,710
being introduced in for LLS sorry and

2083
01:58:43,789 --> 01:58:49,400
you ll SQL wave being introduced for OS

2084
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:53,239
pop3 where we propose that local

2085
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:57,530
interface ipv4 address is exchanged in

2086
01:58:53,239 --> 01:59:00,499
the hello itself so this way normally in

2087
01:58:57,530 --> 01:59:02,929
the OSP of v3 ipv4 working would wait

2088
01:59:00,499 --> 01:59:05,449
for the link LSA to learn the neighbors

2089
01:59:02,929 --> 01:59:08,329
IP address that we could install as a

2090
01:59:05,449 --> 01:59:11,650
next stop in the routing here with this

2091
01:59:08,329 --> 01:59:14,389
TLD we know it from the first hello and

2092
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:19,089
you know so this way we can run BF

2093
01:59:14,389 --> 01:59:21,170
District mode for OSP of v3 ipv4 as well

2094
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:24,650
yeah

2095
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:28,460
so they have received some good feedback

2096
01:59:24,650 --> 01:59:31,518
revenues and interest so I think it will

2097
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:43,400
help to standardize this and like to

2098
01:59:31,519 --> 01:59:52,940
request for working group adoption in

2099
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:57,650
support of adopting out that ITC for

2100
01:59:52,940 --> 02:00:01,669
instance so we got mail from a customer

2101
01:59:57,650 --> 02:00:05,499
who was trying to do this yes and and we

2102
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:05,499
