1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,570
I didn't even look at the check

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,340
[Laughter]

3
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,519
[Music]

4
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,900
tell her

5
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:28,159
okay I think we are about ready to get

6
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:34,810
started I see we have a bunch of remote

7
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,810
people and they seem to be able to hear

8
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:44,689
okay as a reminder to those who are

9
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,090
remote you can get we do have a in the

10
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,370
Medeco interface there's a way to jump

11
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,849
into the virtual queue and you can speak

12
00:03:49,370 --> 00:04:00,439
your questions as opposed to typing them

13
00:03:52,849 --> 00:04:03,230
in jabber and with that I know so we can

14
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:07,280
go ahead and so first of all welcome to

15
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:11,030
the NTP working group this is the IETF

16
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,609
note well you will have seen it before

17
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,789
there are a number of policies to which

18
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:21,109
we ask you to adhere and this is also

19
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:23,870
our IPR regime so everybody if you have

20
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:25,580
any questions feel free to ask if you're

21
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,070
not familiar with it

22
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,550
you did you did actually acknowledge it

23
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:35,360
when you registered as well so anyway

24
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:39,770
that's the note well this is our agenda

25
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,770
for the day yeah we have a second page

26
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,330
the agenda so the first thing we're

27
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,979
going to do is agenda bat well first of

28
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,469
all we're going to do a minute taker I

29
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:50,409
know we have at all has agreed to take

30
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,199
minutes do we have a jabber scribe I

31
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:57,770
thought that might be the case I saw you

32
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,740
sign in so rich has agreed to be the

33
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,530
jabber sky and at this point we're going

34
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,130
to do agenda bashing we had a bunch of

35
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:11,059
ntp related topics first and then after

36
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,560
that we had sort of some tick-tock stuff

37
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,210
even though this was the NTP working

38
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,250
group because to sort of remind

39
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,620
everybody our intention is to finish the

40
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:23,360
enterprise profile and to close tick

41
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,099
tock and create a single time working

42
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,870
group so that we have all of the time

43
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,630
resources in one place because that's

44
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,770
effectively

45
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,159
what we've had for the last several

46
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:35,390
years anyway I have had a request to

47
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,150
sort of swap the tic-tock stuff with the

48
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:44,400
ntp stuff so that for somebody who will

49
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:48,690
be arriving a bit later so so we will

50
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,190
start with the tick tock stuff as far as

51
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,900
the tick tock working group status goes

52
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,020
we do have one document the enterprise

53
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,719
profile and it is ready to go to the

54
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,770
iesg we currently between the two

55
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,860
working groups have four documents

56
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,780
queued up and ready to go and and I have

57
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:09,210
discussed this with rush and they will

58
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:12,570
be coming out post with so the next two

59
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,680
items you can do them in either order

60
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,899
you would like Doug but would be for you

61
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,899
[Music]

62
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:33,109
are there any other agenda bashes by the

63
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:33,109
way no okay you can come up here and do

64
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,620
some Doug Arnold on Vice Chair of I

65
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,669
Triple E 1588 I don't know just give you

66
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:51,830
a quick update where that at we've we

67
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:58,170
have a draft revision it's going through

68
00:06:51,830 --> 00:07:02,180
sponsor ballot and recirculation and we

69
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,180
have some comment on the recirculation

70
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,350
which may or may not force us to do

71
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,390
another recirculation we're meeting this

72
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,820
week to decide that if not we will go

73
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,180
right to publishing they would probably

74
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,540
get out by the end of the calendar year

75
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,010
if we have to do another recirculation

76
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,170
maybe you'll get out by the calendar

77
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:26,120
year we would do a whatever the minimum

78
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:29,640
one is so that's that's where we're at

79
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,600
after that we expect to be updating it

80
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:37,050
with things that we had pushed off

81
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:39,419
working more in the mode of actually 8o

82
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,080
2.1 if you're familiar with that group

83
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:45,359
at all where we will be doing

84
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,030
amendment and core agenda on a much

85
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,270
small shorter time scale and then do a

86
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,188
roll of provision every once in a while

87
00:07:50,270 --> 00:08:08,188
so we'll be making changes right away on

88
00:07:53,189 --> 00:08:12,289
that any questions okay so I wanted to

89
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:17,599
present us a number some slides created

90
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:23,840
by Steve green dirt at IBM and myself

91
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:29,699
mostly Steve we're looking to create a

92
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:32,088
secure profile for 1588 not sure where

93
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,380
we're gonna do it yet but we're just

94
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:39,510
presenting it here to get some feedback

95
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:46,140
if possible it will be a profile

96
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:49,649
targeted at sort of enterprise you know

97
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:57,089
single organization networks mostly in

98
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:58,589
the financial industry but they're

99
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:02,089
adamant they want something that has

100
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,089
built in security

101
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:25,190
so this is being driven to a large

102
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:29,780
extent by regulations in the u.s. we

103
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:32,720
have FINRA and theirs require that the

104
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:37,720
clocks be maintained to 50 milliseconds

105
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,620
which really isn't that difficult but

106
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,770
you have to also law get him you know

107
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,810
provided records showing that you were

108
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:51,050
have stayed in compliance and have

109
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,670
audits showing that you have some

110
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,250
reasonable scheme for keeping good time

111
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:00,319
and that sort of thing a similar

112
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,140
requirement came out of Europe which has

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,220
a tighter time synchronization

114
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:11,090
requirement 100 microseconds and a lot

115
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,430
of firms even if they're in the u.s. do

116
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,380
trades in Europe as well or if they're

117
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,770
in Asia they do trades in Europe and so

118
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,770
they're gonna want to obey that as well

119
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,920
then there's also the players in finance

120
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,360
who were doing faster things and they

121
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,280
they have their own much much tighter

122
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,660
timing requirements just for their own

123
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:41,709
measurement system things like

124
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,709
high-frequency trading going on as well

125
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:52,190
so the data center in this case would be

126
00:10:49,640 --> 00:11:02,810
the data center for a bank or other

127
00:10:52,190 --> 00:11:05,930
financial type firm and so they have

128
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,540
multiple sites that's one of the things

129
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,300
we have to account for even though it's

130
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,339
enterprise network it's it can be quite

131
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,949
a big distributed even globally

132
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,390
distributed network and so there's some

133
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:20,650
there to take that into account with

134
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,650
whatever we come up with

135
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:34,199
so in timing it seems like security is

136
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,769
always an afterthought we had NTP just

137
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:41,639
NTP and then it Auto key to try to add

138
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:46,319
security and now we're we're improving

139
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:49,470
that then we had PGP and all we had was

140
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:51,329
some experimental annex conversion to

141
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,769
that no one ever implemented so we don't

142
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:56,008
really have security for that so it's

143
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:58,949
kind of an afterthought in the timing

144
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:01,199
standards community but not in for these

145
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:03,899
customers there there are adamant what

146
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:06,329
are you guys doing I get calls from them

147
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,350
saying this isn't not acceptable so they

148
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:14,878
really say it has to be secure so it's

149
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:18,029
it's a strict requirement now there was

150
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,560
there is some work that was done and

151
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:23,910
it's going to come out in this revision

152
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:29,579
that I mentioned before in 1588 there's

153
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:32,100
a discussion of approaches to security

154
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:35,519
that's in an informative annex and then

155
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,379
there's there's also a TLV that can be

156
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,050
attached to any PTP message that was

157
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:43,379
defined which we tried to make first of

158
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:46,439
all enough to use various key exchange

159
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:51,389
mechanisms that are anticipated might be

160
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:55,410
used so these things are coming out but

161
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:59,850
they're not out yet and what is publish

162
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:03,920
is just mxk that nobody uses so it's

163
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,920
pretty much useless at this point

164
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:16,460
okay so as I said it's um a required

165
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:19,040
practice in in this industry and you

166
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:27,350
know and really in all industries and an

167
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:34,339
increasing extent and so that that's

168
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:38,870
really the impetus for this impetus for

169
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:45,790
this effort that we're starting is to

170
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:48,050
address this you know many many

171
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,030
presentations and papers have been given

172
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:57,800
on you know the problems associated with

173
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:59,900
insecure time know there's some other

174
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,689
things that have come about talking to

175
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:06,260
people in this industry that they're

176
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:10,540
they would like to see one is we have to

177
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:12,860
take into account that many of the PTP

178
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,189
slaves will actually be just software

179
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,350
running on standard hardware what what

180
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,350
it has available in terms of hardware

181
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,240
support will probably vary and so it has

182
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,630
to be of the work in the worst case

183
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,190
where it's just some server with no

184
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,950
hardware stuff and time stamping

185
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:35,480
capability and you know do the best you

186
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:37,250
can I another interesting thing they

187
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,380
brought up when I talked to some of

188
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,980
these folks is we're already

189
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:45,080
implementing several key exchange

190
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,810
mechanisms can you please not make us do

191
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,250
another one it's just for timing and not

192
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,780
used anywhere else so they would really

193
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,610
like something standard that they

194
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,089
already have implemented that would make

195
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,860
them happy and I'm sure there was some

196
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,330
be some more things that come out as we

197
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,860
get into this they'll say oh it really

198
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,860
we really want this about that

199
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:15,000
so we're

200
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,600
before with an effort to to draft

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,410
something I don't really have a profile

202
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:30,240
to print to yet not sure even where it's

203
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:33,120
going to be it might be here but some of

204
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,069
the things that were suggested that we

205
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,940
might think about because they might be

206
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:41,990
helpful with security would be if you

207
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,029
had a network that could use peer delay

208
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,399
that's easier to secure because a lot of

209
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:53,009
the timing information is just exchanged

210
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:55,620
on links from one device to another in a

211
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:57,209
network that could support peer delay

212
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:02,759
which means every switch basically

213
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:04,829
participates we might we might look at

214
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,889
Tesla which is you know has been

215
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:09,199
described in this group with respect to

216
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:12,380
NTP

217
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:17,329
has been discussed with respect to NTP

218
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:20,490
so you're familiar with our help in PTP

219
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:24,180
we have the possibility to do to have a

220
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,069
profile that requires two-step timing

221
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,388
and that could make security much easier

222
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:33,930
to implement so that's something to

223
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:36,839
consider we could say transparent clocks

224
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:41,388
are a real complication that we don't

225
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:43,740
want to take on at this point because

226
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:45,990
the people who design them I kind of

227
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:51,060
expect to be sort of altering messages

228
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:52,949
as they go through and sometimes even in

229
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,219
a cut-through mode and that can be

230
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:58,469
really tricky if you're trying to do

231
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,360
hash codes and that sort of thing so so

232
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,720
make maybe we won't take that on in the

233
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,720
first place

234
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:14,549
okay so I'm just sort of announcing

235
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:16,019
where we're getting started with this if

236
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:20,849
anyone's interested you know please

237
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:27,509
contact its really quick registry there

238
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:31,498
we go please contact me or steam kundo

239
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:33,629
from IBM we should be driving this and

240
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:36,659
we're we're looking for input on what

241
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:38,488
requirements are or if you're interested

242
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:40,919
in getting started we can go ahead and

243
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:44,609
try to craft something or at least get

244
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,889
some ideas together and what-what PTP

245
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:49,158
options we allow and not allow that sort

246
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:49,158
of thing

247
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:53,450
any questions

248
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:59,669
hi doll Mizrahi first of all they're

249
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:02,279
interesting definitely something that

250
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:06,539
will be interesting in this working

251
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:09,119
group just the general question are you

252
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,100
mainly targeting the financial market in

253
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,249
terms of the accuracy and in terms of

254
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,879
the applications that use Stein or are

255
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:20,580
you also considering other applications

256
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:22,709
we would consider other applications if

257
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,119
they have if they're similar enough but

258
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,090
the people who are coming to us and

259
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,369
saying we want this are from Finance of

260
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,899
those of them we're gonna tailor for

261
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,428
their needs if it works for someone else

262
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:34,559
that's great or if someone comes along

263
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:36,509
and say we also need it and we're

264
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,950
similar enough that the same profile

265
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,499
could work that we would include them

266
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,840
but so far we haven't heard from those

267
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:52,249
folks we're hearing from finance that

268
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:55,379
they want us okay thanks let's do card

269
00:18:52,249 --> 00:19:03,869
anything to say about the white rabbit

270
00:18:55,379 --> 00:19:06,779
variant so white rabbit is very much of

271
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:08,668
interest to the high-frequency traders

272
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,909
there's a lot of them are playing with

273
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:14,369
it already but for most of the customers

274
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:18,629
who are coming to us for this it's more

275
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:20,760
for the regulatory compliance where

276
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:23,850
they're talking hundred microseconds

277
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:27,559
and white rabbit is a complication they

278
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,559
don't need to take on at this time

279
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:39,928
any other questions yeah just a second

280
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,280
go ahead Watson hello this is Lachlan

281
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,710
live from Cloud Claire

282
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,190
you mentioned key exchange where you

283
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:51,840
only want to implement one why not NDSU

284
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:57,120
agree on keys that's an excellent

285
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:59,070
question and we we we definitely would

286
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,330
consider that you know we haven't got to

287
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,290
the point where we're saying this is the

288
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:08,668
one and I think I think it's a very safe

289
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:11,129
bet that the people who will be putting

290
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:12,990
this into their network will also be

291
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,950
running NTP and they'll be wanting to

292
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,500
run secure NTP so I think it would

293
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,480
probably be very helpful to them that if

294
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:27,380
those two lined up in terms of key

295
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,380
exchange mechanisms thank you

296
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:39,120
any other questions let's do again go to

297
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,409
the opposite end of the world anything

298
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:47,840
to say about PTP over extremely high

299
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,840
variance links you know Wireless links

300
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:58,500
no not really I haven't I haven't gotten

301
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:04,040
a lot of feedback from network operator

302
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:06,830
it's about Wireless and PTP I know

303
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:12,389
people do it in sort of dedicated

304
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:15,809
wireless links where both ends are sort

305
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:18,929
of proprietary by the same company there

306
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:21,990
there is there is some work on the a

307
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:25,679
toad I Triple E 802 dot one to support

308
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,830
Wi-Fi and using their built-in timing

309
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,590
mechanism which is likely to have better

310
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,020
hardware support than just TTP messages

311
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,559
so they've developed an interface for

312
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,029
that with

313
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,730
expectation that will be used but I

314
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:46,710
don't I don't know how it fits in with

315
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:51,360
this work I think the people are looking

316
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:54,450
to secure servers which probably won't

317
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:59,449
be on wireless at least not in the near

318
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:03,690
future although eventually they might

319
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:05,879
and wireless devices

320
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,289
you know maybe handheld devices or

321
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:13,699
laptops or something might just need NTP

322
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:17,269
and so they would get ntp over Wi-Fi

323
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,269
would be my guess

324
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:25,379
go ahead Daniel so I continue to

325
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,110
maintain that trying to

326
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:29,850
cryptographically secure a protocol that

327
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,830
only has has one way message

328
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:35,908
transmission so this would apply to both

329
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:37,619
BGP into broadcast mode ntp is basically

330
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:39,389
a duper enterprise because they're never

331
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,100
going to solve the problem lay it X

332
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:42,990
whereas you have a quit have a query

333
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,248
response then you clearly unique

334
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,629
identifier in the query and that

335
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:48,240
establishes a time bound on the

336
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:51,029
freshness of the response but if you're

337
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,499
trying to a set of precision within 100

338
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:57,419
microseconds that wild while that's more

339
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,999
than you that's that's more than you can

340
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,519
expect to get with ntp over the Internet

341
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,840
that's easily achievable with ntp where

342
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,690
you're typically your time sources in

343
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,639
the same data center and if if that's

344
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,590
that it's given that that's the only

345
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:13,110
environment where PPP is practical begin

346
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:18,389
with why not just use ntp for this

347
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:23,789
purpose so that's a good question why

348
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:26,248
not just use ntp because if you if you

349
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,830
pay close attention you can get 100

350
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:37,679
microseconds with ntp with with standard

351
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:41,279
equipment and implementations maybe III

352
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:47,220
think so people who are asking for PTP

353
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:48,520
are anticipating the future let's say ok

354
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,630
it's 100 microseconds and

355
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:54,940
but but the hft people are already

356
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:58,630
turning around information and posting

357
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,740
trades in ten microseconds and so if the

358
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,890
regulator's are really going to be

359
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,450
looking for proper behavior they're

360
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,750
gonna have to bring those times down

361
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,150
they originally have for it recently

362
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,710
asked for a nanosecond I I mean I I

363
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:15,220
think if you're I think if you're trying

364
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:20,320
to get to those levels then you simply

365
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:23,230
you yeah yeah yeah you simply need to be

366
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,870
able to to have it have a trusted path

367
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,190
between the bad between the sort between

368
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,899
the source and the client I think if

369
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,250
you're on I think if you're on any kind

370
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,420
of adversarial network at all like

371
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,590
you're trying to get those positions if

372
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:37,870
you just don't yeah I mean there there

373
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,720
are people even high-frequency traders

374
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:46,689
who use hardware timestamp ntp and they

375
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:51,429
get quite excellent time transfer

376
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,679
accuracies nevertheless there's a number

377
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:57,340
of network operators who have come to us

378
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,490
come to IBM saying we would like secure

379
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:06,459
PGP so we're going to give them that as

380
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:14,170
well and III mean if if if if you I mean

381
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:15,790
I if I mean if if if you have a customer

382
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,800
demanding it just to make them food just

383
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,710
make them feel better with them with

384
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,730
with no particular demands and what

385
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,830
they're actually trying to accomplish

386
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,550
then I did and then okay I and I

387
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,659
understand that I see that all the time

388
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,790
I don't think that's it

389
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,830
that's something if the ITF to consider

390
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:36,760
I think if you're actually trying to

391
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:40,629
solve problems then then the answer is

392
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,720
is is build the network where you can

393
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:46,530
trust your wires and don't do the crypto

394
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,530
because it's not buying you anything

395
00:25:49,080 --> 00:26:01,720
well I think if I look at why why PTP is

396
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,100
popular in a lot of industries it's

397
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,380
probably because the availability of

398
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:14,469
things like boundary clocks and

399
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:18,610
transparent clocks and probably a

400
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:20,500
greater availability of say n devices

401
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,159
with hardware time stamping so that's

402
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,440
that might be what's driving the desire

403
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:34,720
to have a PTP version that's secure as

404
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:43,770
well as NTP yeah I'm not sure we're

405
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:45,760
gonna resolve this today uh Christoph uh

406
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,970
yeah can you guys hear me

407
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,190
I can i sorry I don't have video

408
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,710
available I'm just yeah do to really

409
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:56,740
reinforce untangles point yeah there's

410
00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:01,240
lots of theoretical work and we've also

411
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:03,820
seen it that says basically one-way or

412
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,140
purely one-way communication has this

413
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,060
drawback that then you pointed out

414
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,180
you're always going to be vulnerable to

415
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:15,190
delay attacks um no matter what crypto

416
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:16,960
you throw on the thing um and maybe it

417
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,930
would be healthy to not just think about

418
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:24,340
as like the alternatives being do PTP

419
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:26,890
with mostly or just one way or just use

420
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:30,790
ntp because PTP does support two-way

421
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:32,740
communication um it's in its standard

422
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,420
motor that's just not the main source of

423
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,980
data that you use for the actual

424
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,770
disciplining of clocks

425
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,540
um but you have a wired network and it's

426
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,200
definitely possible to talk both ways

427
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:46,990
and then you can get the guarantees um

428
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,990
and also I know that at least Martin at

429
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:57,940
Martin Lanka and myself are working on

430
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:59,530
prospects of basically combining a two

431
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,840
way and one way approaches to to have

432
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:05,950
like two way

433
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,949
with security cover this 100% guarantee

434
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,950
of what offset you have at worst on and

435
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:15,010
then being able to run like other

436
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,900
protocols um in parallel where you don't

437
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,300
just go from from one to the next but

438
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,740
you actually look at the the measurement

439
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,740
results of both and then you have this

440
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,710
probabilistic basically our fear for

441
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,660
what you have such is probably and then

442
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,510
for in what interval you offset is

443
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:37,660
guaranteed to be and maybe that's going

444
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,910
to be helpful in this disregard but also

445
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,460
good just something be done with a PDP

446
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,460
profile we're mainly are the two wave

447
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:52,690
messages are used for for actual

448
00:28:45,460 --> 00:29:00,510
synchronization well PTP is usually used

449
00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:03,310
in a two-way mode like ntp but you know

450
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,140
you raise one interesting point which is

451
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,030
if you have a network where there's a

452
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,030
some kind of two-way protocol that's

453
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:13,930
been carefully calibrated over some

454
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:17,070
critical link then that might be

455
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:21,540
something that could just be used and

456
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:25,060
other protocols can can initiate at the

457
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:28,300
ends of that link taking taking

458
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:39,060
advantage of that work well

459
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:42,100
characterized delays I think just to

460
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:47,110
sort of wrap this up I think the point

461
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:50,820
is this the revision of 1588 that

462
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:53,229
actually includes a security mechanism

463
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:57,730
will be coming out towards the end of

464
00:29:53,230 --> 00:30:01,690
this year and that's just sort of the

465
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:04,660
beginning of this security work we will

466
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,120
be there's an enterprise profile that's

467
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,730
ready to go to the iesg

468
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,909
and this would be would potentially be

469
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:14,410
something like that for security but

470
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,750
there's a lot of you

471
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,900
this work is just starting so there's a

472
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,370
lot of opportunities and I think that

473
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,790
there's a lot of synergy between the

474
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,229
1588 community and the ntp community and

475
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,300
we're solving some of the same problems

476
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,360
and so the more that we can leverage

477
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,510
each other the better off we will be so

478
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,679
thank you for and if anybody has any

479
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,200
further questions or wants to

480
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,850
participate please talk to Doug I'm

481
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:46,930
kicking you out of the queue christoph

482
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:50,560
okay anything else okay so with that

483
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:56,290
we're gonna go back to the top of the

484
00:30:50,560 --> 00:31:00,060
agenda and the first thing is I'm just

485
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,060
going to do a really quick walk we have

486
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:12,010
the just a quick couple highlights of

487
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,510
work that is been done what I think at

488
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,490
the last meeting we actually announced

489
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:22,000
that the Mac RFC had been published so

490
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:24,100
congratulations to onchao and this time

491
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,160
we can announce with great fanfare that

492
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:33,639
the BCP has been published like last

493
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:37,300
week so to to Daniel and to deter and to

494
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,680
Harlan thank you very much we're very

495
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:43,389
pleased to finally have that off our

496
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:46,990
plate we have three documents that are

497
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,300
actually ready at this point to go to

498
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,730
the iesg

499
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,620
NTS the guidelines for defining packet

500
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,200
timestamps and interleave modes and now

501
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,969
that we've cleaned out some of our of

502
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:05,170
our chaff we can move forward with those

503
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:07,750
and did I mention interleaved modes I

504
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,850
did yes NTS the guidelines for defining

505
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:14,290
time stamps and the ntp interleave modes

506
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:16,689
are all ready to go to the iesg with

507
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,639
that we didn't do a face-to-face

508
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:23,430
hackathon but we did actually have a

509
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,480
virtual hackathon this weekend with the

510
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,140
with some folks remote were they going

511
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,970
to speak to it

512
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:33,160
or was

513
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:35,020
was Chris you're gonna talk or okay it's

514
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,040
Chris drama oh he is on line there he is

515
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,040
so Krista are you ready

516
00:32:47,400 --> 00:33:00,420
I don't know if he's actually just are

517
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,580
you ready to talk about the NTP

518
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:18,210
hackathon are you can you get in the

519
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:21,750
queue okay well we will come back to him

520
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:25,140
I'm not sure what the issue is but they

521
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:28,590
did Watson and Chester and Martin all

522
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:33,270
worked over the weekend actually Martin

523
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:34,439
and and so if any of you all want to get

524
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,420
in the queue and give a quick update on

525
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,640
what you did that'd be great otherwise

526
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,170
we will talk about it on the mailing

527
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:53,340
list

528
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:54,929
yang yeah hi everyone I'm trove I'll

529
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:03,990
give you a short update on the yang

530
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:07,140
model so next yes so we made an update

531
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:10,320
between the two ideas mostly editorial

532
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,909
we were given comments regarding the

533
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,250
yang style guides that we should use

534
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,610
more references describe the reference

535
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:19,168
in detail so we made that change we got

536
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,750
a comment regarding the security

537
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:23,819
consideration and explicitly

538
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,129
highlighting that how the security of

539
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,889
keys are taken care by the yang model so

540
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:31,589
we have updated that we are also using

541
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,070
the NAC M technique which is the net

542
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,830
conf

543
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:39,810
access control list so IR which we said

544
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:41,279
the NAC M default deny so that the part

545
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:43,590
which we don't want people to have

546
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,690
access to such as keys modifications

547
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,639
that is hidden by default so those are

548
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:51,000
the main changes that we have done and

549
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,250
done a little bit formatting the based

550
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,489
on what is the RFC style guide with

551
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,080
respect to tabs and and all the other

552
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:00,549
things that you need to take care before

553
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,119
your documents can be sent to

554
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:06,220
I see so we got some comments from

555
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,170
Watson so thanks for that one of the

556
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,480
things we wanted to explicitly discussed

557
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,960
in this face to face is currently the

558
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,180
NTS is not part of this young model now

559
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,579
among the authors we thought that it's

560
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,140
better to get what we have right now out

561
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:22,210
of the working group and anything else

562
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,460
and new work anyway will continue and we

563
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,740
will use the augment mechanism of the

564
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,290
base model to add new features and it

565
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:33,160
could it's perfectly fine for them to be

566
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:35,500
in a future document but we can get what

567
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,379
we have right now which is in a pretty

568
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,210
stable space and publish it so that's

569
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,560
the feeling of the authors but we want

570
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,500
to know what the working group agrees

571
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,960
with this or or not or whether NTS we

572
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,400
should wait and add NTS into this model

573
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,740
itself so that's what's one of the key

574
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,349
things which I wanted a feedback from

575
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,750
the group and if the group doesn't care

576
00:35:53,349 --> 00:36:02,819
the authors have a feeling that we want

577
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:05,109
to publish what we have right now so

578
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:06,970
personally I think it should be there

579
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:08,920
yeah and I don't think it's like a

580
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,720
serial process right so you don't have

581
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,970
to wait for any has to be done to start

582
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,819
incorporating things in there so just do

583
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:18,040
the stuff in parallel and I can hold the

584
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:19,599
document somewhere up the line for the

585
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,369
references right so I don't think it

586
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,599
should be an issue like we can still go

587
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:24,730
through the whole process like other

588
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,839
things and then when oh those who's

589
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,300
trying to kick it out and then if

590
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,180
something changes we can take care of it

591
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,420
after right that's how I think about it

592
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,828
the only thing is maybe from the

593
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,619
author's point of view I think the

594
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:41,200
authors are little in the work let's go

595
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:43,569
otherwise you'll keep adding us keep

596
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,549
making us wait for new new features so

597
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:48,810
that's still feeling but like you want

598
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:52,420
to do what what's right at the same time

599
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:54,339
it really is sort of a separate piece

600
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,530
right I mean the implementations have

601
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:59,609
sort of separated the NTS server from

602
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,810
the ntp server so they're sort of to

603
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:09,130
implementation wise they're two separate

604
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:11,440
pieces this probably don't ever coexist

605
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,549
right so I'm just saying like if there's

606
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,109
enough commonality

607
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:15,579
them like we should do the right like as

608
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:16,839
I said like do the right thing right but

609
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:18,579
if there's nothing in common like go

610
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,319
ahead right but I'm sure there's like a

611
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:22,660
bunch of stuff in common that you're

612
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:24,219
either gonna like redo or like you know

613
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,660
probably miss it right like something

614
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:27,189
like that well I'm not sure like how we

615
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,868
want to do this like if you want to skip

616
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:31,170
it too later like oh you know it would

617
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:33,999
use team amount is that what you think

618
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,619
basically whatever is the common

619
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:37,779
grouping whatever things that we can use

620
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,549
we will use and if it's needs to be

621
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:41,829
implemented separately it's better

622
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:43,569
belongs in a separate draft so I want to

623
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:48,059
know more opinion more feedback what's

624
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:48,058
the right thing from the group as well

625
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:58,150
go ahead Harlan I trust you can hear me

626
00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:03,279
yes we can hear you

627
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:05,349
cool so the two questions I have are has

628
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:09,339
a reference implementation of the yang

629
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:13,209
model been done yet and is it possible

630
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:15,729
to use any of the existing NTP

631
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:20,410
authentication schemes with yang as in

632
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:22,959
the existing private key model I think

633
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,839
the the private key part is there Auto

634
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:30,069
key doesn't exist and NTS is also not

635
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,049
there so only the basic the key

636
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:34,170
configuration thing is there in the

637
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:38,049
model and with respect to

638
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:41,380
implementations we had done a very

639
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:44,829
simple nothing that we can ship right

640
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:47,109
now but just to make things working some

641
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,910
tests internally but we cannot say that

642
00:38:47,109 --> 00:39:00,459
we have a vendor implementation either

643
00:38:48,910 --> 00:39:01,660
for this model yet thank you like I'd

644
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:03,669
like you know want a break or something

645
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,339
just go for it like just get it down

646
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,499
send it off and I just don't want to do

647
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:14,799
abyss of this right no it's definitely

648
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:17,229
never gonna be the it's always going to

649
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:18,489
be augmentation or a scheme amount or

650
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:23,169
something never it's not going to be

651
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:24,910
abyss Harlan you're still in the queue

652
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,290
did I did you get back in or did I

653
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,190
forget to push the button

654
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:31,740
you forgot to push the button excellent

655
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:44,290
thank you everyone

656
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:46,299
okay yeah it's not there yet what go

657
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,800
back to the yeah let's do whatever is

658
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,800
after the yang and I'll get this upload

659
00:39:50,700 --> 00:40:01,270
alright port randomization Fernando you

660
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:04,060
registered a oh okay so you're in the

661
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:07,270
queue did you register as a remote

662
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:13,140
presenter or as a oh let me give you

663
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:18,570
that Prelude yes go ahead

664
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:22,109
okay so I'll be presenting the draft on

665
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:25,500
pole randomization in NTP version for

666
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:25,500
next slide please

667
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:31,660
so as an introduction to this document I

668
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:35,859
will switch off video because maybe it's

669
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,299
better for him for the network as an

670
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:39,759
introduction to this document it's

671
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,920
essentially a document that updates the

672
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:47,280
various entities specification so that

673
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,690
NTP clients employee for randomization

674
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,690
Fernando we're having a bit of an issue

675
00:40:52,619 --> 00:41:00,220
it's a better now yes it's better now go

676
00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:03,280
ahead okay so essentially this document

677
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,919
updates the base NTP spec so that it

678
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,119
employs poor randomization for NTP

679
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:14,890
clients this document essentially puts

680
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:17,920
the inspect in line with BCP 156 which

681
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:21,100
is a PCP produced by the transport area

682
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,460
on transport protocol poor randomization

683
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:27,580
the base NTP specification essentially

684
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:31,480
suggests that NTP clients employee the

685
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:34,410
NTP service port 123 for the local port

686
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,060
and this has a number of implications

687
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:39,470
for example it makes blind attacks

688
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,960
against NTP easier

689
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,029
it hinders distributed denial-of-service

690
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,760
mitigation because it's not easily to

691
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:49,390
tell NTP server versus NTP client

692
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,740
packets and of course this is a

693
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:54,080
requirement that cannot be complied with

694
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,299
when you have multiple NTP clients

695
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,609
behind and not because of obviously you

696
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:02,530
cannot reuse the same port number for

697
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:04,848
the multiple clients most NTP

698
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,849
implementations already do this because

699
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:10,609
essentially they rely on the underlying

700
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:13,820
operating system for picking the TN side

701
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:17,180
port and since nowadays most operating

702
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:19,369
systems employ transport protocol for

703
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,460
randomization then this means that all

704
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:27,920
of these NTP implementations benefit

705
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:30,020
from that next slide so this is

706
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,300
essentially what this document does it

707
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:36,859
recommends poor randomization on a pair

708
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:39,230
Association basis I spell out this thing

709
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:41,270
clearly because at some point we were

710
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:44,420
discussing whether to do randomization

711
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:48,140
on a per association or a per request

712
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:50,030
basis but this is the most recycle

713
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,609
server tip take it's not that we have

714
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:55,460
closed the door to randomize in on a a

715
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:57,650
per request basis but this is the you

716
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,950
know the most conservative take and the

717
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:02,960
document formally updates the NTP spec

718
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:06,740
obviously is so that you know this is a

719
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:11,990
the default choice for NTP clients next

720
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:15,080
slide so from an author's point of view

721
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,240
we wonder if the NTP working group wants

722
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:21,799
to take this document as a work work and

723
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:27,439
go buy them so it's our question to the

724
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:29,720
chairs on the working group okay there's

725
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,800
been a Fernando can I ask you do one

726
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,649
more thing that I know there's been a

727
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,030
fair amount of traffic on the mailing

728
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,040
list about this can you just summarize

729
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,560
what what you believe the traffic on the

730
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,380
mailing list has been yeah there have

731
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,450
been essentially any two things so some

732
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,990
of the comments essentially were that if

733
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:51,560
you do poor randomization on a per

734
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:53,109
transaction basis then that might have

735
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,360
issues on the

736
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:58,520
calculation of the time synchronization

737
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,420
because packets might go through

738
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:07,610
different paths that's why this version

739
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:09,880
of the document essentially has taken

740
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:12,530
the most conservative approach which is

741
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,980
randomizing on a per Association basis

742
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,900
so that's one of the things the other

743
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,000
comments that we have received I think

744
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:23,780
they were from Dunning was that well

745
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,720
these doesn't completely eliminate like

746
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,540
blind attacks or that there are other

747
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:32,120
mitigation for this and our response to

748
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,790
that is that poor randomization is a

749
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,589
mitigation against blind attacks are at

750
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:39,290
the transport layer so you can do

751
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:42,680
anything else on any other layers in

752
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:45,920
fact you should these control measures

753
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,279
are essentially orthogonal that means

754
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,430
there are things that you can do at the

755
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,650
application layer like NTP us or there

756
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:57,529
are documents proposing that but this is

757
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,530
orthogonal to that you know whenever you

758
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,600
want to perform blind attacks against a

759
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,430
protocol well there are a certain number

760
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,790
of values that you need to guess or know

761
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:10,129
at least IP addresses our transport

762
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:12,740
protocol port numbers and obviously one

763
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:15,620
demise in the you know port number on

764
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:23,319
the client side of course increases the

765
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:25,609
difficulty to perform such attacks okay

766
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,780
obviously we will need to take this to

767
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,360
the mailing list eventually are there

768
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,780
any comments today about adoption of

769
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,780
this draft

770
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:44,700
okay we will let me do it another way

771
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:48,780
is there anybody opposed to the adoption

772
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:50,490
of this draft hmm anybody in favor

773
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:57,630
anybody will read it if we actually

774
00:45:50,490 --> 00:46:09,270
adopt it what too many questions I'm

775
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:13,859
being corrected by already okay go ahead

776
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:15,450
Watson and fried comments I support

777
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:19,049
adoption and I think we really do need

778
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:22,078
this mechanism for loss prevention among

779
00:46:19,049 --> 00:46:25,109
other things okay excellent

780
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:29,520
so we will take the call for adoption to

781
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:32,460
the list so I'm gonna go backwards in

782
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,410
time briefly to the hackathon since

783
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,329
juster can't get to the mic I'm just

784
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:40,920
going to point this out I've uploaded it

785
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:42,569
as I've uploaded it to the materials

786
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,160
page so it's not really a slide and I

787
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:47,730
clearly don't expect you all to read

788
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,890
this at this point but basically the

789
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,170
group of them worked for two days over

790
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:55,220
the weekend and I can't see that myself

791
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:57,779
so I have to look at my version here and

792
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,930
this is basically the test results of

793
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:06,150
how far they got and what they tested

794
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:07,589
and I first of all I would like to thank

795
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,059
everybody who worked remotely I know

796
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:11,328
especially the guys in Europe you guys

797
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:14,520
were we're working fairly late on this

798
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:18,559
and so if everybody would take a quick

799
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:21,270
look at that and see where we are and if

800
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,049
this seemed to be fairly useful I think

801
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,569
it would be useful to have a

802
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:26,579
conversation on the mailing list about

803
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:29,029
whether to do another one of these again

804
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:32,970
I know the next IETF meeting is actually

805
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:35,880
in Singapore which time zone wise is is

806
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:37,649
pretty challenging but maybe we can pick

807
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,920
another time or another date if this is

808
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:42,720
useful to do the other thing that we

809
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,910
talked about I mean we had previously

810
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,089
discussed setting up a mailing list I

811
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:50,319
set one up but we never actually used it

812
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,880
specifically for implementation

813
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,530
discussions I think at this point

814
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,630
implementation discussions are you know

815
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:57,610
the ntp mailing list is generally not so

816
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:59,530
overcrowded that we can't have those

817
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,440
discussions on the ntp mailing list as

818
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,850
well but we also used a slack channel I

819
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,000
don't know if a slack channel is useful

820
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,770
going forward for folks to you know

821
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,680
discuss implementation testing questions

822
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:14,890
whatever so will will ask that question

823
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,910
on the mailing list as well but thank

824
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:21,970
you to the to our completely virtual

825
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:26,950
hackathon team any other questions or

826
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:28,390
comments on the hackathon stuff I will

827
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,549
say it's really made a difference on it

828
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:32,589
on helping us make get critical mass and

829
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:37,140
move NTS forward so I think it's really

830
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:45,280
it is very key all right

831
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:46,480
next was on implementing time so next is

832
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,610
on chow

833
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,610
[Music]

834
00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:02,020
I don't have any slides on it because

835
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:06,590
there is no major change from the

836
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:08,540
discussion that we had in Thailand there

837
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:12,500
was no comments to be addressed there

838
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:15,320
was just a minor negligible change in

839
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,840
the POSIX section that that's mostly the

840
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,630
editorial changed that there was um I

841
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,140
don't think there was anyone who was

842
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:34,370
against the adoption of the document so

843
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:36,140
I guess that's the question did anybody

844
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:39,940
have any questions or comments on the

845
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,940
adoption of the document we're there

846
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:53,870
okay so we're basically getting like

847
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,750
four or five documents out the door and

848
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:58,400
then four or five documents in the door

849
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:02,090
is that a good thing or a bad thing I

850
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:05,570
think it's a good thing it shows some

851
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:08,330
sort of progress all right so there's no

852
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:10,220
questions or comments so thank you to

853
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,380
Angela and Wilhelm for the the update of

854
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:20,000
this document and we will look at

855
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:21,920
adopting it next was rough time yes so I

856
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,410
don't have slides for either that too

857
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:30,530
but after the last discussion at the

858
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:32,960
IETF and the in Prague we have updated

859
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:35,420
the rough time draft choice and with two

860
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,850
major changes one is in the timestamp

861
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:40,070
section we have added the modified

862
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:43,130
Julian date format for the timestamps

863
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:45,800
and the second change was about the

864
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,330
delay attacks that how does rough time

865
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,160
handle delay attacks and have updated

866
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,049
that based on the text contributed by

867
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,950
tile thank you to all for the

868
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:57,770
contribution there were other structural

869
00:50:54,950 --> 00:51:02,750
and language changes that was

870
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:04,250
contributed by Marcus DNS of Marcus by

871
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,760
Marcus I don't know how to pronounce his

872
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:09,859
last name sorry based on his implement

873
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,770
an experience he wanted some

874
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:16,490
clarification for the text and language

875
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:19,850
so I made that in the last update of the

876
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,879
draft and there were as far as I believe

877
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:26,299
no outstanding issues if anyone has some

878
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:30,980
comments or suggestions um you can see

879
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:34,010
now questions or comments on the rough

880
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,650
time draft is anybody in here read this

881
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,750
draft Oh excellent

882
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:43,960
how about how many read the implementing

883
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:46,060
time draft know a little bit better

884
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,380
excellent

885
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:57,859
no remote questions on implementing

886
00:51:48,380 --> 00:52:03,530
comment on the rough time okay oh wait

887
00:51:57,859 --> 00:52:06,170
Watson okay it's one of the co-authors

888
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:10,330
of the rough and draft we are currently

889
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:14,330
working on or I am currently working on

890
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:17,359
reconciling the pol with the rough time

891
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:19,609
estimates um if people have an actual

892
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:22,069
use case where this is necessary please

893
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:24,529
let me know because otherwise it's quite

894
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,970
a bit of work for applications like

895
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:29,600
taking a checking whether these

896
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:32,480
certificates you don't need this so

897
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:35,480
please let me you know if people have

898
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,710
ideas of implementation and application

899
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,390
areas that would be useful in guiding

900
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,390
the future evolution thank you

901
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:58,990
okay with that I guess we have nothing

902
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,900
no questions franchise so thank you we

903
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:05,250
will work on adopting that okay thanks

904
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:15,970
[Music]

905
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:17,560
the next one is a draft well net meta

906
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:19,899
can talk to it I think we've only seen

907
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,720
meta remotely before so I don't know I I

908
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:24,520
was here oh that's right you were here a

909
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,959
year ago I forgot about that have we've

910
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:33,099
seen you remotely since so hi I'm Nana

911
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:36,550
and and I want today to a present very

912
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:39,190
briefly a horse a a mechanism for ntp

913
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:43,390
and the updates that were made based on

914
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:48,849
the comments that we got for a working

915
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:50,379
group adoption next slide sorry it's a

916
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:54,280
John work with their Danny to live

917
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:57,070
tamazaki and massage appear so the short

918
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,109
reminder is and we consider this this

919
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:01,359
rich mana but we assume that the

920
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:02,859
attacker have fully control of a large

921
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:05,440
function of the NTP server it's a

922
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:09,279
quarter we somebody is capable of both

923
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,440
designing yes and determine when the

924
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,780
response is going to advance and of

925
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,270
course we assume that is malicious and

926
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:21,130
try to shift declines time as much as

927
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:25,960
possible and makes like please ensure

928
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:27,970
each reminder of their solution sure so

929
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,820
on the one hand we rely on many NTP

930
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:33,189
servers we generate large pool of NTP a

931
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:36,730
hundred of servers to a plan but on the

932
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:38,380
other side we choose at random only

933
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,230
terms of them in order to avoid

934
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:43,450
overloading the NTP servers and finally

935
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:46,410
we use a smart filtering in order to

936
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:49,390
remove outliers and make the heart

937
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:54,720
attack here to contaminate their chosen

938
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:59,410
sample and next slide please

939
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:03,399
so so far we got comments on two topics

940
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:05,558
the first one was that we should decide

941
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:10,269
where were you how we want to use

942
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:13,720
harness to enhance and TP security and

943
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:17,649
whether it will be externally and today

944
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:21,038
and to be all within the within the NTP

945
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:23,740
so in 1201 we added a he brewed approach

946
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:26,920
when we say that when precision and

947
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:30,910
currency are critical then basically by

948
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:33,970
default use ntp V for updates and array

949
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:36,640
when a threat or evidence of attack

950
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:40,990
detected based on horn samples then you

951
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:43,900
can use a long time instead and the

952
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:46,750
other topic was that since Hannes use

953
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,880
great authority of the sample site

954
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:52,119
server over time so maybe it can cause

955
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,970
adverse very effect on precision and

956
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:58,359
constancy so in rough future we evaluate

957
00:55:54,970 --> 00:56:02,348
the dis effect a both on precision and

958
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:04,390
in currency in different location both

959
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:06,640
in Europe and in the US and we found

960
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:09,490
that home says fair precision around

961
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,470
three milliseconds and thumbs up dates

962
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:14,589
are close to and to the average NTP

963
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:19,740
updates and up to two to three

964
00:56:14,589 --> 00:56:22,720
millisecond gap next slide please

965
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:25,058
so so far we have updates and draft

966
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,779
based on all the comments that we got

967
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:30,160
and and of course we continue a

968
00:56:27,779 --> 00:56:32,680
evaluator honest performance and

969
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,140
security and for different attacks at

970
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,940
different location in the world and we

971
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:45,670
believe the songs draft is ready for

972
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:48,059
working group adoption thank you from

973
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,059
Harlan

974
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:57,060
and good questions so we we assume that

975
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:59,550
for now it's

976
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:02,430
Ananta cated because we don't have

977
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:06,250
authentication yet but we assume that

978
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:10,000
the concept of course and query many

979
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:12,400
servers can be still exist and we can

980
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,010
still benefit it even when we are

981
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,010
talking about an authentication servers

982
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:41,319
okay any other questions yeah so we

983
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:44,020
consider a man and me we talked about

984
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:48,460
men in the middle but basically we

985
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:51,310
assume that it's a a much more

986
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:54,640
sophisticated a attacker that they have

987
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:57,880
control over the servers which means

988
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:07,420
that we want to recognize it the eddies

989
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:10,140
attack by authentication is that answer

990
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,140
your question okay

991
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:27,070
oh that's a Wow yes

992
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:30,400
Wow I can't first that that's a pretty

993
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:39,880
big assumption what you're assuming that

994
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:43,170
the we want to be and we want to be able

995
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:49,240
to co-op with a more sophisticated

996
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:53,040
attack carrier is so I think it's I

997
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:55,830
think essential and and of course I am

998
00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:00,570
it can also

999
00:58:55,830 --> 00:59:03,980
and chuckle a delay tax and other things

1000
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:17,070
that that authentication servers won't

1001
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:23,690
be able to to detect anything else from

1002
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:23,690
oh there's one more from Harlan rich

1003
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:41,759
okay lots of servers oh that's it yeah

1004
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:44,240
because we're trying to be the this to

1005
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,600
create a safer environment that you can

1006
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:50,310
so of course we you can say yeah one D

1007
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:55,589
probability that would the attacker

1008
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:57,390
would have and we'd have this kind of

1009
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:00,570
control of a large function of the

1010
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:03,529
identity pool but it doesn't mean that

1011
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:06,210
we don't want to consider it when we

1012
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:15,600
when we want to create a new mechanism

1013
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:18,390
and that cooperate does so okay did you

1014
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,520
do you want to say some yeah Suresh

1015
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:22,680
Krishna so like one thing that like I

1016
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,150
like about this is like one of the

1017
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,740
things that has changed in the Internet

1018
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:28,380
is the threat model itself right so if

1019
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,549
you start from 3552 we always assume the

1020
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,500
communication channel might be

1021
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,720
compromised but the endpoints are

1022
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,310
usually not right and and I think the

1023
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:38,129
IAB has started some kind of work on

1024
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,590
this thing to actually redefine this so

1025
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,670
I think it's like a timely thing like

1026
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:43,260
you know you don't know how that's gonna

1027
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:45,060
go like the how they be that model

1028
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,340
update is gonna go but I think it's in

1029
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:49,140
the same kind of category so I think I'm

1030
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:52,640
supportive of the work personally so I

1031
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:54,960
think it's good thank you

1032
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,350
jabber Danny Meyer says this might be

1033
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,600
useful if ganged with an NTP server

1034
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:02,160
again can it so hide together with an

1035
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,220
int it might be useful tied together

1036
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,970
with an NTP server Jenny says it might

1037
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,240
be useful

1038
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:10,740
um it's my

1039
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,899
sure I understand this comment just

1040
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:23,850
relating the exact words maybe can even

1041
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:25,440
explain a little more yeah he hasn't

1042
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:29,029
typed anymore in here and it's not okay

1043
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:33,480
so what I can say is that in order to

1044
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:36,000
make it more deployable which right you

1045
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,670
to come up with a mechanism that it

1046
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,460
relates to the client and may be

1047
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:46,950
modified it for will really timing

1048
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:50,250
modifications of course we can maybe

1049
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:52,500
benefit from using or modified the NTP

1050
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:56,880
servers but then I think that the

1051
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:59,210
deplorable will be much harder so we are

1052
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:04,520
looking at it this is one of our of our

1053
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:08,610
further research topics actually so okay

1054
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:11,820
any other questions so I think we will

1055
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:13,920
take the this adoption discussion to the

1056
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:15,840
mailing list so thank you one other

1057
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:20,450
thing I wanted to noted if those of you

1058
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:25,020
haven't looked at the a NRP schedule

1059
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:29,700
that not the the IRT F open meeting

1060
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:31,950
tomorrow is featuring as it does every

1061
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:34,680
time one or two of the a NRP Prize

1062
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:37,410
winners and Netta is one of the Prize

1063
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,540
winners and she is presenting this work

1064
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,830
there tomorrow so it'd be interesting to

1065
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,070
see what the with the broader community

1066
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:46,950
thinks and so congratulations to you and

1067
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:49,560
I imagine several of us will show up to

1068
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:52,140
hear you but I am interested in seeing

1069
01:02:49,560 --> 01:03:02,070
how its received by the broader IETF

1070
01:02:52,140 --> 01:03:05,700
community as well so okay the so at this

1071
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:09,960
point we've covered all of the documents

1072
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:12,450
that were updated I think we have a

1073
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,950
number of calls for adoption that we

1074
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:18,629
need to do we have some that we haven't

1075
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:20,060
done yet for existing documents and we

1076
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,320
also have

1077
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:26,910
[Music]

1078
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:28,620
a document we need to send out I believe

1079
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:31,170
it's ready for working group last call

1080
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,580
I'm not sure it's the ref ID document

1081
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,080
the last time we talked we said we

1082
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:36,779
needed to pull the leap smear stuff out

1083
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:39,150
that's been done and I was looking at it

1084
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:41,030
again and I believe it's probably at

1085
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,690
this point ready to go and we just

1086
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:44,250
haven't done that

1087
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,870
I don't know Harlan if you had any

1088
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:48,240
planned updates to that or if you were

1089
01:03:45,870 --> 01:04:01,970
ready to send that for working group

1090
01:03:48,240 --> 01:04:06,060
last call should be ready to go okay

1091
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:08,069
great and then I know that we have some

1092
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:09,600
extension field Docs that we didn't send

1093
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,980
out for adoption as I said we're

1094
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,540
clearing our plate of a bunch of

1095
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:16,680
existing documents and we'll get to work

1096
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:19,320
on the additional documents at this

1097
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,930
point we have reached the end of our

1098
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:30,780
agenda if does anybody have any other

1099
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:33,839
business oh so Suresh can you hold up

1100
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:35,580
the blue sheet is there has everybody in

1101
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,440
the room sign the blue sheet okay so we

1102
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:44,520
pass that around again so folks can sign

1103
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:47,250
it and I think that brings us to the end

1104
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,870
we sort of wrapped up a bunch of at the

1105
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,370
process of wrapping up a bunch of work

1106
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:52,380
that's been on the table for a long time

1107
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:56,759
which is kind of a good feeling once we

1108
01:04:52,380 --> 01:05:06,000
get it actually wrapped up so any other

1109
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:08,760
questions well oh wait I maybe I missed

1110
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,190
it but did you mention did a

1111
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,860
minimization draft what's the status for

1112
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:17,070
that I didn't think oh yeah that's on my

1113
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:19,350
list I skipped right over it so that we

1114
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:24,930
believe the status of the data

1115
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:27,810
minimization draft is that it was it's

1116
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:30,600
gone to working group last call and we

1117
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:32,460
were waiting on one set of comments we

1118
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:35,250
haven't received those comments and so I

1119
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,540
believe at this point and we need to

1120
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,940
a quick review of the mailing list

1121
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:42,320
ourselves just for our own sanity but I

1122
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,320
believe it's ready to go to the iesg

1123
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:49,319
so yeah I mean was that the I mean as I

1124
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:57,180
recall that the the current draft

1125
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:59,010
represents everything so this is so I'm

1126
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,810
guessing Harlan that you can't you you

1127
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:05,850
don't have audio right that's why here

1128
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:08,150
okay so in the in the oh he is oh okay

1129
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,150
excellent

1130
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:14,880
go ahead Harlan I don't believe I've

1131
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:16,440
received any responses to the objections

1132
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:22,620
I've brought forward on the data

1133
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:24,360
minimization draft so this image I'm

1134
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:26,430
gonna speak Rancho real briefly this is

1135
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,870
where we might this is what I said we

1136
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:29,879
need to review them the mailing list

1137
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:31,020
because I thought that we were at this

1138
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:35,160
stage where we were waiting on

1139
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:37,410
information from new Harlan sir I did

1140
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,420
not understand I did not know that so if

1141
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,220
I if you are waiting on information for

1142
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,500
me I'll have to go figure out what it

1143
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:45,480
might be and then take care of it all

1144
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,590
right so maybe the thing to do is to

1145
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:51,510
have a small conversation with the data

1146
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:52,800
minimization authors and you and maybe

1147
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,930
the chairs and figure out what pieces

1148
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,600
were missing but when that dinner and I

1149
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:59,430
were talking earlier today we've thought

1150
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:01,500
that it was something we were waiting

1151
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:03,299
from you for so I mean I don't have any

1152
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:06,600
new information the objections I've

1153
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:07,920
raised I've done before and I don't know

1154
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,850
what new information you could want

1155
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,850
about them but okay

1156
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,808
I think we're gonna have to take this

1157
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,740
offline Harlan because there appears to

1158
01:07:30,809 --> 01:07:36,450
be using between at least the chairs so

1159
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:40,020
so so we'll set up a side conversation

1160
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:41,700
with with the parties involved here but

1161
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:45,170
our understanding was it's been through

1162
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:48,480
working group last call and the the

1163
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:51,119
objection that we had we had one

1164
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,800
objection on the table so that's that's

1165
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,119
the answer she original question on Shaw

1166
01:07:52,800 --> 01:08:01,770
which is what's the status of that draft

1167
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:03,270
so all right so way forward is the last

1168
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:05,190
thing I did recall that I there was one

1169
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:07,020
other thing I want to talk about we do

1170
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:09,180
seem to make a little bit better

1171
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,950
progress when we do virtual interims so

1172
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,629
we will be planning some virtual you

1173
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:16,729
know one maybe two virtual interims

1174
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:21,660
between now and the Singapore meeting

1175
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:25,410
and we may try and plan some sort of a

1176
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:29,068
virtual interrupt testing event for NTS

1177
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:36,358
if that makes sense as well any other

1178
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:38,549
comments questions comments excellent

1179
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:41,719
thank you very much and I give you some

1180
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:41,719
extra time back in your day

1181
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,700
this has got to be one of the quietest

1182
01:08:54,760 --> 01:09:00,870
rings I've ever seen guys clearly did

1183
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,870
not do your afternoon coffee

1184
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:05,930
