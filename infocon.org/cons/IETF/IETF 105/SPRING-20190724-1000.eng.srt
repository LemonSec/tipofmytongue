1
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,390
good morning folks if you're not

2
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,770
interested in segment routine now is a

3
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:30,170
good time to leave the room

4
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,970
Adrienne thanks if you are interested it

5
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:46,190
might be a good time to leave the room

6
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:49,070
still but you know it's so welcome to

7
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:53,390
spring 105 we have a fairly packed

8
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:55,729
agenda as usual so we'll get started if

9
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,619
you haven't seen the note well here is

10
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,619
the note well it's Wednesday I expect

11
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,780
you've already seen it we need a minute

12
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:06,080
taker and a JavaScript

13
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,410
do we have any volunteers the minutes we

14
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,790
can do anything apart as usual any

15
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,790
volunteers for a minute taker

16
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:36,670
please so so so ok but that's not great

17
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:41,410
we can look here if you'd like somebody

18
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:43,769
to watch Jabba patron thank you very

19
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,770
much indeed

20
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,500
Stuart suggests that we need a working

21
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,089
group secretary volunteers for that I'm

22
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:05,500
not gonna block on right now so the

23
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:07,480
document status oh and thanks BK the

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,970
documents later since last time we

25
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,530
adopted SIV six network programming I

26
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,780
think we're pretty much they would

27
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,900
adopting the SFC drafts that we

28
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,730
discussed last time - and the RFC editor

29
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,620
is very close to publishing this large

30
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,929
cluster of documents that we've had all

31
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,150
in sort of in dependencies between their

32
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,780
references so that's the MPLS base

33
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,060
therapy enter all a bunch of MPLS

34
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,190
documents that though that are related

35
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,440
some pc ones and then the IGP extensions

36
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,150
so this represents a pretty good step

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,160
forward what this book gets published

38
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,110
we were the stage of debating what they

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,970
are what the order of the RFC numbers

40
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,730
should be so I'm thinking at this point

41
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,560
where we're pretty much done with these

42
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,980
this is this is good because it also

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,810
closes off some of our milestones so

44
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,510
this is the set of milestones that when

45
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,860
we eventually reach arted last year we

46
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:03,100
kind of reached the SR MPLS document

47
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,560
we've sent YSG that's great we had this

48
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,530
milestone for MPLS anycast

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,120
this document seems fairly dead and so I

50
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,890
think we probably should conclude

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,190
whether we actually need the document or

52
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,870
not and if we do then it is be brought

53
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,959
back to life if not we should remove

54
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,700
this milestone the yang conflict model

55
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,530
we're pretty much there with I think

56
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,360
there's the author's have now addressed

57
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,859
all outstanding comments on it so we

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,250
just we just need to progress it through

59
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,590
the working group process then we have a

60
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,440
set of things where we have documents

61
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,630
and we just need to

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,820
figure out what whether we whether

63
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,190
there's an extra work required SRT

64
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,750
policy there's been relatively limited

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,030
review of the stock I added some

66
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,460
comments by it would be good for folks

67
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,789
to look through this because it's it's a

68
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,620
document that most of their other HP HP

69
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,420
extensions the PC extensions are

70
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,700
dependent on so it would be good to get

71
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,240
a detailed technical review on this from

72
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,750
the more of the working group face our

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,760
MPLS so a.m. and performance management

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:09,530
we progress some of the LSP pink work in

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,570
MPLS who this other path Prakash is

76
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,309
presenting on today I think what would

77
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,840
be useful is to figure out as a working

78
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,970
group whether we have anything

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,659
outstanding there is there anything that

80
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,340
we've or we need to specify for

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,780
performance management Bernard is still

82
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,729
kind of discussing and would welcome

83
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,409
inputs on where we should progress this

84
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,760
work should it be done in there Alesso

85
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,450
ppm or should we do it here in the

86
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,130
spring and sr b6 now programming Cameron

87
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,539
is going to give an update on today and

88
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,300
policy yang model I don't think we have

89
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,680
a document for this at this point

90
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,250
cameras and Cisco Systems yes we do have

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,440
a document as submitted a dot has

92
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,630
expired it was renamed and has been

93
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,200
submitted we asked for slot I will

94
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:56,240
probably get next okay that's great and

95
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,310
then the stateless service training work

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,750
we've got the two drafts that we agreed

97
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,550
to adopt last time

98
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,090
so we're progressing through some of

99
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,590
these I think it would be good to just

100
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,599
kind of focus our work on making sure

101
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,429
that these milestones get get completed

102
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,980
we have a quite a lot of proposals but

103
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,570
new work we're not and not necessarily a

104
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,990
bunch of progress on some of these

105
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,880
things this is something Byrne and I

106
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,620
were discussing yesterday we'd like more

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,930
technical review of documents working

108
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,490
group I think we're going we have a

109
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,680
number of drafts where we we kind of

110
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,640
adopt them and then or they come to the

111
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,580
working group when we don't necessarily

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,860
have have detailed technical review on

113
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,080
them so what we're proposing to do is to

114
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,790
have two technical review a gate that

115
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,979
says two technical reviews adoption must

116
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,890
be done before we consider working group

117
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,870
adoption and there wouldn't last call so

118
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,130
what we would say there is like if

119
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,740
you're an author of a document you would

120
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,940
like

121
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,920
please find some folks that are also

122
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,020
interested in your working area and

123
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,580
let's make sure that we get get some

124
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,760
review as to whether this looks like the

125
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,039
right thing I think we want to make sure

126
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,690
that we surface technical disagreement

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,160
earlier in the process rather than

128
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,080
necessarily getting to the stage where

129
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,330
we're late in the process and then folks

130
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,159
disagree technically on what the right

131
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,200
approaches as we've seen with someone

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,210
today

133
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,260
so any comments on this is a particular

134
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,479
as a if if we introduced this as a

135
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,490
requirement in spring is there a strong

136
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:29,890
disagreement to this or any disagreement

137
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:37,450
or agreement okay silence is consensus

138
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:43,180
so this is the silence is not consensus

139
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:45,550
it turns out a cylinder you know you

140
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,520
know you can request the chairs can

141
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,760
request routing directory reviews both

142
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,549
that at both points absolutely I think

143
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,810
one of the challenges is the the trying

144
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,520
to make sure that the documents get

145
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,050
iterated on in the working group so the

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,940
director I think is great for giving us

147
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,500
that that external perspective but it

148
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,790
doesn't necessarily like I don't think

149
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,470
we could sign those folks up for helping

150
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,680
with progressing the documents so this

151
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,060
is also to train like give us a wider

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,910
group of folks they're able to help

153
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:17,770
progress work through the work but

154
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,750
thanks easy so this is the agenda we as

155
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,880
usual had a lot of requests while

156
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,770
actually not as usual this was we had

157
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,480
many more requests for this meeting than

158
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,580
we had for the previous ones so brunai

159
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,710
webpack had looked we have about five

160
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,750
hours of requests for two hours of

161
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,549
meeting time this time it makes our job

162
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,229
particularly difficult especially if

163
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,289
there's been no discussion of the draft

164
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,890
and it's a 0-0 we end up then inevitably

165
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:46,060
having to add things to drop things and

166
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:48,189
and and prioritize the work it's it

167
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,900
please try and make sure your craft is

168
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,190
discussed on the mailing list please try

169
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,530
and make sure that you've got it some

170
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,730
import it's the earlier the better you

171
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,350
submit your the draft I think so if you

172
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,680
haven't got a slot on it and please

173
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,439
introduce your work on the

174
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,660
mainly Liz let's have a discussion just

175
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:08,360
as a transparency thing the way that we

176
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,399
prioritize the agenda is that we first

177
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,689
look at whether we have discussions for

178
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,490
things are already in adopted by the

179
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:15,740
working group and then by things that

180
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,509
have interest in the working group which

181
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,389
is usually indicated by what happens on

182
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:21,829
their mailing list if your draft has not

183
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,569
been discussed on the mailing list and

184
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:25,969
it's not a working group item you should

185
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:27,498
probably expect that there's it's it is

186
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,939
in the bunch of things that we're not

187
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:33,230
playing that we have to make a

188
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:34,849
prioritization decision about okay so

189
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,879
unless there's any last-minute agenda

190
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:43,009
bashing then I think we're ready to kick

191
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:46,160
off your hobby I found question so why

192
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:49,910
not we arrange another session for a

193
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,199
working group it's not clear that we I

194
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,459
mean we could have added another session

195
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,109
we could have added two more sessions

196
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:57,979
but it's not clear is actually a good

197
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:01,189
use of time right so if we if the reason

198
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,559
to have an additional session is just to

199
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:05,120
introduce a bunch of 0/0 drafts that we

200
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,649
haven't got any kind of clear consensus

201
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,259
that are interesting to the working

202
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:12,230
group then what's the bound

203
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:14,149
so I actually in my opinion it's better

204
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,610
for us to have less time and prioritize

205
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,170
work the as such that we make forward

206
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,699
progress on it rather than we have a

207
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,809
bunch of drafts in the working group

208
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:22,809
which don't go anyway

209
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,899
hi I'm Bob Hindon just if it's helpful

210
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,209
what we do in six-man for drafts that

211
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:35,059
have not had discussion or new we give

212
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:37,219
them five minutes at the end no you know

213
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:39,259
basically title slide three content

214
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,660
slides no discussion it's just a way of

215
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:45,230
introducing the work and that that's how

216
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:54,759
we manage this we were proposing to

217
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:54,759
Stelio process with credit okay

218
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:13,260
[Music]

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,140
okay hello everyone my name is Carmen

220
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm going to give a quick and short

221
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,689
update on a service network roaming

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,700
draft list of main authors and lots of

223
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,790
contributors I think they got chopped

224
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,950
and this change but you can look at the

225
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,800
draft so we had presented this draft

226
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:12,170
last time in last Montreal ITF ITF one

227
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:17,060
or two so this is really an update since

228
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:19,310
then and it's like please so so in after

229
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,839
Montreal one or two right we have a

230
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,300
network roaming indeed your draft

231
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,950
version seven based on the feedback from

232
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,199
working group and chairs that this was

233
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,820
splitting into two document that we took

234
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,400
the illustration out of the document and

235
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,890
submitted a 0-0 version draft for the

236
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,540
illustration and after that the

237
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,610
remaining part of the draft basically

238
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,640
was adopted as working group document

239
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:44,600
during last ITF so we resubmitted as a

240
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,370
draft ITF 0-0 after Prague the next

241
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,830
slide

242
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,080
since firaga after submitting to as an

243
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,050
idea working document we updated this

244
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,240
document frozen furthermore the key e

245
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,400
changes to the document version zero

246
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,090
zero or ITF to version zero one or

247
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,939
basically we we added we reposition of

248
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:07,250
the services locator broken into block

249
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,370
operator block and a network ID part

250
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,870
this was added as request come from

251
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,820
control

252
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,010
in protocol I think is as president in

253
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,890
LSL working group in is is a city

254
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,720
structure TLV as well as best working

255
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,089
group yesterday for a service itself is

256
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,290
a draft which also used use it as a city

257
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:28,330
structure TLV so this BnB : n repetition

258
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,180
of the locator was done based on control

259
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,880
pain request we also added a normative

260
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,920
reference to SRH insertion draft that

261
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,800
was to take take care of a comment that

262
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,800
came as a last last ITF we also

263
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,329
clarified the use of no next header for

264
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,890
ipv6 which is value 59 I have a for the

265
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,470
slides to discuss this little bit more

266
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,680
in detail but we change our text to

267
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,940
clarify a little bit more and also we

268
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,359
updated the registration process

269
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:02,020
procedures for our endpoint registry in

270
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:07,300
IANA it was originally specified as ITF

271
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:10,000
review but since other non ITF bodies

272
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,490
like 3gpp they can also request the

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,550
allocation of or requests some endpoint

274
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,760
behaviors so I think based on that we

275
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,250
change our assertion procedures from ITF

276
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,790
review to specifically required as per

277
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,220
RFC five two to six guidelines and we

278
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:32,560
also made some under a duty rich base to

279
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,150
our version zero zero X like this so so

280
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,699
that is version zero one that data

281
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,740
stands today what we plan to address in

282
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,050
our next revision or so is basically

283
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,270
align our network priming draft with

284
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,660
Sigma routing header draft which is in

285
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:49,420
osg right now in six-man it has updated

286
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,550
sudo codes and behaviors so we plan to

287
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,920
update or network roaming to align with

288
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,349
with those changes that mean it will be

289
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,180
a larger torii other changes to update

290
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,240
all over pseudo code to make sure the

291
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,729
align with a sh draft after it has gone

292
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,930
through I further is your review so that

293
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,940
is what's coming in our next revision

294
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,219
and there are future items that we can

295
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:14,529
discuss later next slide please okay so

296
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,830
there are the two two main open issues a

297
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:20,620
one was a definition of effective next

298
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:24,210
header field I think this will be no

299
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,830
issue once we have already aligned over

300
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:29,250
dropped with the surest draft in the

301
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:31,410
next revision or so then the definition

302
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,170
of eh it will really be non-issue

303
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,250
because our pseudocode will will be

304
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,990
aligned with a Suraj

305
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,910
so I think that issue will be solved

306
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,610
will not be actually no issue going

307
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,170
forward the issue number two is I think

308
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,899
though the the main issue that we want

309
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:50,339
to bring to the into the working group

310
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:53,130
is the use of next header 59 which is no

311
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:55,440
next letter for ipv6 so our reasoning

312
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:58,560
for using this in order original

313
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,140
proposal and original specification is

314
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,479
that the city itself basically defines

315
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,149
you know type of packet processing and

316
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,180
what is underneath the underneath the

317
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:12,360
ipv6 outer header or a suresh after a

318
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,130
setch headers so the basically provides

319
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,470
the context of the you know what you

320
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:20,660
need to process after decap saluting the

321
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:23,430
ipv6 and the extraction address and

322
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,040
basically no next header type II V 6

323
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,959
identifies this there is no further no

324
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,849
further IP you had to process in the

325
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,380
packet it does not necessarily mean

326
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,420
there's a Ethernet header underneath and

327
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,490
I'll talk about that a little bit later

328
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,839
so there was a loss of discussion on the

329
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,600
mailing list both in his spring and

330
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,650
6-man working group without any clear

331
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,130
consensus there were a few suggestions

332
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:50,579
that were that listed here there was

333
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:53,689
proposal to use next set of 97 which is

334
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:58,230
an Ethernet you know base if their IP

335
00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:00,000
specification RFC 3 3 7 8 but that that

336
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:04,800
brings some comprise issues and you know

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,500
then they cause an extra extra alter IP

338
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,369
address between ipv6 header and an l2

339
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,760
frame on encapsulation side so there's

340
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,800
that that it has this this descanse

341
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,410
there was a proposal to allocate a new

342
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,169
protocol value out of Vienna protocol

343
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,579
internet protocol registry to specify

344
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,370
something like next ID or equal to

345
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,500
Ethernet there's again no clear

346
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:30,389
consensus on that there was also

347
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,960
discussion to basically redefine the

348
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,210
meaning of 59 and the last but not least

349
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,800
is to keep keep using the current use

350
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,990
which is 59 so

351
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,760
these were all four three or four

352
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,100
proposed of that that went back and

353
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,270
forth on the mailing list with no clear

354
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,070
consensus next slide peace so

355
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,889
additionally I think one we like to

356
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:56,490
highlight that most of the solution that

357
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,920
were provided you know do not get that -

358
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,820
basically ethernet frame or unstructured

359
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:06,060
videos because in cases of 3gp

360
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,179
specification under ipv6 encapsulation

361
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,610
in ipv6 order header you can have on a

362
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,600
structure videos which do not do not

363
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,870
necessarily have to be through net

364
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,929
frames so they also are using fair value

365
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,969
59 so even if you you know we will

366
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,280
define a new type or whatnot the the I

367
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,920
think 1 1 specification cannot handle

368
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,710
both cases so so that is one thing that

369
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,180
is also to keep in mind that we not only

370
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,770
have to worry about if the net frame

371
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,190
under ipv6 header but maybe Ana

372
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,050
structured video is PDS as well 3gpp and

373
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,770
maybe of some other feature work going

374
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,379
forward and since we already have a 59

375
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,810
which says no next header you know

376
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,530
defining another thing that says the

377
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:51,360
same thing really I think doesn't seems

378
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,940
very reasonable to us so at this point

379
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,229
in time I think between authors we

380
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,970
recommend to keep using 59 you know and

381
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,160
as well because some they're already

382
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,620
implementation in progress and probably

383
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,180
completed which are already using 59

384
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:12,840
with the semantics in mind yeah like

385
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:15,090
that says next slide please yeah I

386
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,270
strongly disagree you should not be

387
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,149
using this no next header an ipv6 means

388
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:24,300
no next header period doesn't mean

389
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,700
something else you should do something

390
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,639
differently I'm fine if you get a new

391
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,820
allocation but like you know this should

392
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,400
not break current ipv6 usage and I think

393
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,040
this will I mean as we said this fair

394
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,980
quite clearly on the mailing list so I

395
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,980
disagree with what you just said okay

396
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,280
just to reinforce that I do not think

397
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,510
the working group can adopt this

398
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,960
document with this usage of 59 it is a

399
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,940
violation of existing RFC's and you can

400
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,540
pretend the RFC's means something else

401
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,700
they don't this is very clear there are

402
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,740
vulnerable possible alternatives or you

403
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,679
can find another alternative I don't

404
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:15,720
care but you can't just hijack an

405
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,720
existing code point and change its me

406
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:23,380
Tom Herbert so I think there's a similar

407
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:26,110
issue with extension header insertion so

408
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,059
the the draft does update the reference

409
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,969
but it references the document that we

410
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:34,450
did describe on 6-man briefly but the

411
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,309
conclusion may be the conclusion was you

412
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:40,000
really can't insert extension headers

413
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:46,330
into packets without encapsulation okay

414
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:51,490
I'm thinking Lorenza kalevi I was I

415
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:53,889
wanted to think you know wanted us all

416
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,940
to think about you know how much ipv6

417
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:59,980
address base this paradigm will need I

418
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,559
am you read through the draft and it

419
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,080
says well you know the examples here

420
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:10,090
where we allocate a 32 a / 32 for every

421
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:13,360
ruder but we don't like say how much we

422
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:16,120
need so a 32 / Rooter is very expensive

423
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,280
right because if you want to have some

424
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,928
sort of reasonable number of rooters

425
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,399
you'll easily end up saying well you

426
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:23,919
know with with some moist edge you end

427
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:31,660
up requiring a large address block just

428
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:33,580
for this now I think saying the exact

429
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,280
amount of the draft says the basically

430
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:39,809
the exact amount of space is unspecified

431
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:43,780
depends on whoever deploys this I think

432
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:46,510
given the excessively large amount of

433
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,100
space used any examples I think there

434
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,309
are two problems first of all we need to

435
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,290
give some examples that won't cause

436
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:56,168
operators to use very large amounts of

437
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,930
space and second I think the draft needs

438
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:00,940
to have a credible discussion

439
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:04,000
how much address space is actually

440
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,740
needed for a useful deployment of this

441
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,630
model because if it turns out that you

442
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,940
need a slash 16 to make any of the

443
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,510
useful stuff in this document work then

444
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,250
it's not gonna fly unless we get I an

445
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:20,770
Adele to allocate a slash 8 for this

446
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:22,390
right so if on the other hand it's fine

447
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,129
to do it's fine to say well you only

448
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,580
need to slash 64 for the whole network

449
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,200
then there's no concern my point is we

450
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,429
can't say this is just a parameter that

451
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,740
we're just gonna move it left and right

452
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,150
because if we move it too far to the

453
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,620
left that means that basically we're

454
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,550
taking a large chunk of the internet and

455
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:42,850
throwing it away I are you commenting on

456
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:45,330
micro segment Micra see the draft that's

457
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:52,689
on the draft that's on the screen right

458
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:54,610
network program draft it it assigns the

459
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,440
example of scientists live city to for

460
00:22:54,610 --> 00:23:01,510
every ruder loop back through the loop X

461
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:09,190
right no I I just read in example you

462
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:11,050
sing just for Darren Dukes room Cisco

463
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,240
Systems just for clarification that I

464
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,430
think he's referring to the example so

465
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,630
if you were to use a 2001 DB 8 it says

466
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:21,490
nice 32 it's it's it's a examples are

467
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,740
given for brevity and the number of

468
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,750
characters it yeah exists just examples

469
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,540
they're just exist examples but I think

470
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:31,330
I think maybe he had another point where

471
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:38,260
he asked for a credible discussion on

472
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:40,480
address space this is a point if you're

473
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:44,410
okay so if your example is a slash 282

474
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,070
for every ruder a people are likely to

475
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,840
follow it and that's ways tool and be

476
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,090
somebody reading it might think that you

477
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,010
can't do anything unless you unless the

478
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,220
actual amount of address places on that

479
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,510
order of space and that is kind of

480
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,880
wasteful and we need to think carefully

481
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,680
about it if that needs to come from

482
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,520
global space sure we can collaborate

483
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,230
that thanks yeah Jenny yeah I like the

484
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,300
second what Lawrence is saying because I

485
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,950
read the draft and initially to be

486
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,970
honest I was confused

487
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,039
because I

488
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,559
sentient the draught might be confused

489
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,530
in ipv4 and ipv6 by assigning / such a

490
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:23,770
two parallel back I was thinking it's a

491
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,539
typo in your surely alright and but the

492
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,860
draft keeps saying that is an example

493
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:33,610
and it's not example met it's actually a

494
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:35,918
colon colon 1/32 and then be a concur on

495
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,620
the 1/32 so you it looks like you're

496
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,780
clearly providing an example of / 32

497
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,030
without any real justification and

498
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,908
people tend to follow RFC so I do

499
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,549
believe we need to have some discussion

500
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:50,679
on address space which is actually

501
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:51,668
required why it's required and where

502
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,860
it's coming from

503
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:57,309
so I'm not otherwise had you to go and

504
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,110
start working on IDE 12 deployment

505
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:01,270
scenario those are mostly for

506
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:06,360
readability convention what definitely

507
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:06,360
can take this comment and now an update

508
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,809
Austin here

509
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,668
I just wanted to second what Cayman

510
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:15,580
remains have said but I also wanted to

511
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:18,370
raise the point here that we're talking

512
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,928
about address space here perotta but if

513
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:24,309
you look at what network programming

514
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:26,559
does it talks about endpoints right down

515
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:29,260
at the egg mmm that makes this whole

516
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,039
worse than a 32 perimeter because this

517
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,960
then becomes per docker container I've

518
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,780
got to be able to share and program all

519
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,169
the way to the end and in the context of

520
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,809
the examples even if I was using a 48

521
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:48,070
there the amount of space that I'd be

522
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:51,190
burning would be absolutely you know so

523
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,789
this is something we really really need

524
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,320
to look at okay so can you send this on

525
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:59,559
the mailing list and we can continue

526
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,620
there but we I want to get back to you

527
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:05,440
now it's a next under discussion first

528
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,309
you Brian I want to talk about okay so I

529
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,720
was looking at the registry there are

530
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:13,658
about a hundred of these things for the

531
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,240
entire life of the internet which we

532
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:18,159
hope is a very long time it seems to me

533
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,409
that if you do anything you should put

534
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,299
an indirect operator in there because I

535
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:25,270
can see a whole lot of pseudo aisles

536
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:26,379
going over here I can see a whole lot of

537
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,100
programs go

538
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,410
I can see many constructs so if you go

539
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,590
for a new type you really should use

540
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,900
that to introduce a shim which you can

541
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:41,770
then play with as long as it as much as

542
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,020
you like thank you I'm Banneker Juniper

543
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:47,379
Networks I'd also like to talk about the

544
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:50,620
effective next header two comments first

545
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,410
RFC 8200 calls the effective next header

546
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,270
the upper layer header might as well use

547
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,750
the same term as opposed to redefining a

548
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:01,418
new one second they're about nine SIDS

549
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,940
that require access to the enh to

550
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:08,320
process I'm thinking of SIDS like end

551
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,169
dt4 and d t6 when the effective next

552
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,080
header follows the SRH it's easy to know

553
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:16,030
what the effect of next header is when

554
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,120
the in some cases when the effective

555
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,860
next header does not follow the SRH the

556
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,080
only way to know what the effect of next

557
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:25,149
header is is to chase the chain all the

558
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,600
way to the end and then go back and

559
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:31,000
process the SID in some cases where

560
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,520
there's an ESP between the SRH and the

561
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,190
effective next editor you have to do

562
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,950
addy caps of the encryption operation to

563
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,860
get there it might be a better idea

564
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,960
rather than putting those SIDS in a

565
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,539
routing header to put them in a

566
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,730
destination options header so the effect

567
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,559
of next header will actually be the next

568
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,200
header and it's easier to process

569
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,928
there's no reason to put a destination

570
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,059
option in a routing header okay so now

571
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,559
your admission that a signature only

572
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:01,090
headed off is getting updated and then

573
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,980
E&S you will not be a problem in our

574
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,720
next revision but I'll let their income

575
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,740
in mode from my set aside yeah there are

576
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,350
Duke Cisco Systems the pseudo code in

577
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:16,270
the SR header drafts you know walks

578
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:19,330
through how and SRH is processed and any

579
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:22,450
subsequent headers are processed Mike

580
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:26,110
Cameron said that that pseudocode style

581
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,150
and mechanics needs to be adopted by the

582
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:31,178
network programming guide no one that

583
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,770
does I think your questions well they're

584
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:34,750
answered simply because the next headers

585
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:37,389
get processed in order well still the

586
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,270
process B SID you need to know what the

587
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,660
effect of next

588
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,940
which means you need to look well beyond

589
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:47,330
the routing header to know what this

590
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,250
amazin again in the SR header graphs we

591
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,409
describe how that upper layer header is

592
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,940
is processed and when that same pseudo

593
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:56,180
code gets used in network programming

594
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,310
then this question will be will be moved

595
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:01,130
it won't exist because it'll it will

596
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,840
describe how that happens the complexity

597
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,480
simply goes away people in the

598
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,280
destination option there now okay you

599
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,690
introduced many extra things if you put

600
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,690
something in a destination option either

601
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:15,410
kill the person blah blah blah but you

602
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,150
know like we said the pseudo code will

603
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,980
solve that yeah and I think we'll take

604
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,710
this for the route to milling list but

605
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,000
for NH 59 how do you recommend we take

606
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:27,920
it to mailing list and continue from

607
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:33,020
there so there is suggestion tool to ask

608
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:35,810
for a new door cutter can do and we'll

609
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:39,070
try that okay so I think other can meet

610
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,070
and and all up get on the mailing list

611
00:29:42,550 --> 00:30:08,810
thank you anyone who hasn't signed the

612
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:11,710
blue sheet so I want to thank the chairs

613
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:16,340
for letting me to speak here because I

614
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:18,830
did oh thank you I did submit this draft

615
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,929
late I have to say a couple of things

616
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,600
one is I'm trying to be helpful

617
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:27,680
you may or not may or may not believe

618
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:31,270
that and the second is this is just a

619
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:34,850
proposal because the idea of managing

620
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:37,970
especially Global's heads manually or

621
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,969
through funky ways teen appealed to me

622
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,370
and then because for the ring thing I

623
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,500
was going to introduce more of them I

624
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,080
decided we need to just tackle the

625
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,780
problem the second thing is I just

626
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,800
subscribe to the spring mailing list I

627
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,100
think I'm going to

628
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:58,159
unsubscribe right now I don't know what

629
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,020
kind of these discussions what enh and

630
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,320
stuff is like I don't know actually I

631
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:06,560
should confess I don't know DHCP I don't

632
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:11,419
know ipv6 and I know very little spring

633
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:13,790
but we'll manage okay so yeah the

634
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,590
problem set is basically you need sage

635
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,740
to be unique certain types of states

636
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,629
that you want to be unique unique in a

637
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,880
certain domain maybe an IDP area maybe

638
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:28,370
in a and then a s and so you definitely

639
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,530
don't want to allocate the same said to

640
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,360
two different routers unless you're

641
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:38,300
doing any caste which is a special case

642
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:39,889
and ideally as a router that resource

643
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,840
for some reason should get back the same

644
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,090
set now if you do it by configuration

645
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,820
you will but if you use other means you

646
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,820
need to kind of try to it's not a master

647
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:53,210
it's a very very should if you can do

648
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:56,929
everybody should so you can do this with

649
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:59,210
manual management but there are problems

650
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,370
and then as the number of such types of

651
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,580
shades goes up and the number of paratha

652
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:09,729
goes up this the manual approach doesn't

653
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:13,030
look very good so so this is sort of a

654
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:17,030
four-man sketch of how this would work

655
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,889
it's yeah it was it was it was a nice

656
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,170
you know animation thing but this is

657
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:24,260
fine it's pretty much what you would

658
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:26,690
expect is a couple of things I want to

659
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,629
highlight initially all the routers are

660
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:33,830
provisioned with srgb s which is the

661
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:36,830
same as today and potentially a DHCP

662
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:39,110
server address all those you know some

663
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,850
of our discussions are it words putting

664
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,439
that in eius eius or something because

665
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,750
you know got everything else in a size

666
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,560
might have uh put that in because we're

667
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:51,980
going to use unicast dhcp for this so

668
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,590
then any router that's configured to do

669
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:58,190
a node sales or rings heads or whatever

670
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,750
will make a unicast DHCP request for a

671
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:04,010
set of whatever type at once

672
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:05,270
in the the DHCP server basically I mean

673
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,160
it doesn't really care

674
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:10,639
any of the semantics of this all it

675
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,380
needs to know is did this router already

676
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,720
ask for this it in which case it should

677
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,210
give it back if it hasn't then makes a

678
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,100
binding and then it gives us it so it

679
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,960
just thinks of this as a block and you

680
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,419
know your alligator said you say that

681
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,560
that's it has been allocated to this

682
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,300
router and then since its DHCP you have

683
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,060
release time but you can keep that to be

684
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:36,710
pretty high and then you reply that said

685
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:39,500
and router or loopback address binding

686
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:42,350
back to the router and now the router

687
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,120
can advertise it into IGP or whatever it

688
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,689
wants or advertise it so essentially

689
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:50,959
this DHCP loop it replaces a

690
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,070
configuration step and then the one

691
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,290
thing that you have to do if you're

692
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:57,290
using DHCP is before the lease expires

693
00:33:54,290 --> 00:34:02,870
want to renew your lease and if the

694
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:05,270
router restarts it needs to you know

695
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,669
well the DHCP server should make sure it

696
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:10,520
gets back the same said so there's a

697
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:12,320
timer for the lease and then there's

698
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,679
another timer for how long you want to

699
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,240
remember the router to set binding which

700
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,250
could be much longer than the least time

701
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,489
or it could be the same again

702
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:25,250
I don't know DHCP but the point is you

703
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:27,439
do want to keep that sticky you do need

704
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,710
a back door in case that router is never

705
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,970
going to come back or whatever but you

706
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,040
know you could just have that binding

707
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,409
unless you are really tight on your sit

708
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:41,150
block you could just have a binding be

709
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:43,129
for a really long time so typically we

710
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,260
would use this for notes is anneka acids

711
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,300
rain cells which if I have time I'll

712
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,820
talk about it could also be used for all

713
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,930
these other compressed sets that we're

714
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:56,240
now at least having a discussion about

715
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:59,980
the the second part of my talk is I'm

716
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:03,890
sneaking through the backdoor the ring

717
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:06,350
the use of seeds in rings before I go

718
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,470
there though I do want people to comment

719
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:15,560
on the use of DHCP for this I see Adrian

720
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:17,569
getting itchy and and and I mean like I

721
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,770
said this is trying to be helpful

722
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,050
so I

723
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:24,259
you think that this is not a good use of

724
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:27,290
DHCP I should also say that I know the

725
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,210
DHCP RFC one of them says don't use this

726
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:32,300
on routers so of course I want to use it

727
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,850
on a router but that said if you have

728
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,070
any reason technical reason why this

729
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,390
would not be a good thing or if your

730
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:41,840
alternatives I think this should be

731
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:44,540
discussed but trying to get anything

732
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,230
that you can make not manual is a good

733
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,520
thing I think so Adrian uh hi this is

734
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,920
from Jabba

735
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,380
I'm not two questions in Java first one

736
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,620
is how does this work when you need to

737
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,100
SIDS for a device it's a very good

738
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,410
question

739
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,410
you want to SIDS for the same prefix

740
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:09,230
yeah it's not it so it's it is a good

741
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,860
question we've had this discussion but

742
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:15,290
not enough and I don't know enough DHCP

743
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:19,100
but but I do specify that in the draft

744
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:21,290
that if you were requesting a said ring

745
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,480
SEDs they come in pairs so you get a

746
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:25,970
clockwise and anti-clockwise so I just

747
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,460
want DHCP to do that now can it I don't

748
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:31,310
know but it should be able to for other

749
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,220
cases if you want to SIDS but you have

750
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:36,950
only one prefix we probably have to do

751
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,450
an extension for that right so it's a

752
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:41,540
good measure maybe the person is raised

753
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,100
this point can contact you sure off list

754
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,580
because you're not on the list no I'm on

755
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,529
the list

756
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:49,580
I thought - I might be on the list at

757
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:52,850
the end of the session in there and the

758
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:57,549
second one from Robert Zoo is why not

759
00:36:52,850 --> 00:37:00,940
use this mapping plane instead of DHCP

760
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,940
I'm only the messenger

761
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:08,169
to my limited knowledge of DHCP it's a

762
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,109
very good tool for saying up a block of

763
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:13,599
things you want unique allocations I can

764
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:15,910
do that for you DHCP servers over the

765
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,470
years have become you know quite clever

766
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,019
at doing these things so I think it's

767
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,240
well suited you could use a number of

768
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:25,598
things there's also a suggestion that we

769
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,779
use a s RMS I don't know what that is

770
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,779
but you can use that you can see them

771
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:34,749
really well worse in spring but it is a

772
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:36,910
spring thing so there are alternatives I

773
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:39,129
think it's great to have a discussion if

774
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,598
you take it out of the configuration and

775
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,089
put it into one of these protocols I'll

776
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:47,289
be happy I'm not where it should be at

777
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:50,109
CP just ensures optimum so you're keen

778
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:52,269
on university sounds like option 82 you

779
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:55,269
don't really need locally defined sRGB

780
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:56,950
have a central NBC P server and just get

781
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:58,868
right one you don't need to have

782
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:03,279
configuration and device up from DHCP

783
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:06,309
server just make it ephemeral into it so

784
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:08,109
making it ephemeral is fine srgb s are

785
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:12,460
typically going to be unless you really

786
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:14,499
want to move it it'll probably be per OS

787
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,569
or per release or whatever it's not

788
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:18,368
something that changes very often unless

789
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,819
you have a specific reason for doing

790
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:20,470
that

791
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:22,839
it's the SIDS that are the problem not

792
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:24,819
the sRGB actually that's a connection I

793
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:28,180
have to make in the draft that I say

794
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:29,680
that the DHCP returns srgb gama said i

795
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,379
think the gates

796
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,538
you know you handle asaji B's as you do

797
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,160
today and if you stamp that out if you

798
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:38,859
have like three types of routers in your

799
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,019
network and you have three sRGB it's not

800
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:42,788
a huge thing to configure configuring

801
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:44,979
individual SIDS and making sure they

802
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:46,420
don't overlap or they don't clash is a

803
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,539
bigger problem that's the one I'm trying

804
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:52,839
to solve next but I mean again

805
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:56,170
everything is up for discussion I'm

806
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:58,749
going to now lean on the chair I I know

807
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:02,079
we had a big describe this yeah it's

808
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:04,779
definitely arranged how do you see we

809
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,789
use a mapping between the seed with the

810
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:09,279
algorithm is it part of your DHCP

811
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:14,999
request or will it be managed locally

812
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:14,999
base or outer yes

813
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:20,250
what you said I understood the words but

814
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,170
I didn't understand anything so I have

815
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,660
to think about that I will I will

816
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,310
consult with people who know and will

817
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,370
come up with an answer but I mean I

818
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:33,270
think that whenever you have sheds that

819
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:35,910
you want to be global so these are the

820
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,820
flags I'll go sit there possibly flex

821
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:41,930
I'll go oh yeah you need to know at

822
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:45,450
least locally also hotel to which always

823
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:48,120
yeah so so then it sort of goes back to

824
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:52,649
the previous question that how do I get

825
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:55,109
two or more SIDS so so then yeah I think

826
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:58,170
the request may be more than the prefix

827
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:02,070
of the blue back of the router so you

828
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,630
might have other fields so that type may

829
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,060
have to be more than that type you might

830
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:08,340
say I want to flex I'll go but I have a

831
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,370
subfield which is the actual I'll go hmm

832
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:14,550
so yeah all good questions and I think

833
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:17,790
we can extend that okay and regarding

834
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,710
the manual manual allocation we are

835
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,540
talking about we are not really using

836
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,090
manual things today because we have

837
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,160
resource allocation too so you are doing

838
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,690
your request to get already your seat

839
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,609
from a tool which is completely

840
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,410
automated the process and then it goes

841
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,840
to an automation which will publish on

842
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,670
the scene which is fine yeah but I'm not

843
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,790
reading this is about edits just another

844
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,890
way to do it right so we can standardize

845
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,300
that using DHCP if people think that's

846
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,330
the right thing or we can do it with

847
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,240
less for SRMs or whatever but I think

848
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:50,460
it's good for us I mean if we're if the

849
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,919
spring working group says node said or

850
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,510
these unique sets are important I think

851
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,090
it makes sense to at least have a

852
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,010
recommendation maybe not a mandatory you

853
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:01,260
must implement it this with DHCP but

854
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,970
here's a recommendation from the spring

855
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:09,420
working group of how to handle this

856
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:11,279
unique request okay thank you yeah yeah

857
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,470
okay

858
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,680
in fact at the beginning of the second

859
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:18,959
routing I already proposed as the SIDS

860
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,270
should I be allocated automate

861
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,460
automatically and also we proposed the

862
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:27,000
solution based on the piece F under the

863
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,330
PGP we believer that's the PGP I am he

864
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,610
say

865
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:31,920
not only the see the allocation but also

866
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,280
other functionality can also be used

867
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,060
either our network but I think that you

868
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,940
you the DHCP I'm seeing little we are

869
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,160
the to me I seem like we're yeah yeah

870
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,580
the second one I think well I proposed

871
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,970
she said the PGP they produce the

872
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:52,500
Challenger they think the notice idea

873
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,810
they seem there's always this day

874
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,450
typically either not always that anomaly

875
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:59,700
it would be allocated so I think that

876
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:02,100
there is a leasing this and maybe not as

877
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,470
suitable for that enemy but maybe some

878
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,779
of the Pythian say the awesome this can

879
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,759
be dynamically allocated this is the

880
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,640
second opponent the third point I sinker

881
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,490
because you use the DHCP I also think

882
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,460
that this a services or maybe some kinda

883
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:20,700
weather you know that's the ipv6 address

884
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,530
for the Rooter I mean so not let us see

885
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,149
how you use it you also you that the

886
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,160
other CPU to allocate you were you

887
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,220
seeing that the cedar either shouldn't

888
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,799
be allocated dynamically by the DHCP

889
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:34,259
server I think the reuters ipv6 address

890
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,840
should also can be dynamically used the

891
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,970
bad DHCP I completely agree but I'm

892
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,270
gonna get short if I say that the thing

893
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:46,020
about ipv6 or any loopback address

894
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:47,970
people want to know what the mapping is

895
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,880
from a loopback address to a device and

896
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:53,459
the idea that is allocated by the DHCP

897
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,340
server seems to scare them but these

898
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,200
SIDS don't have the same semantics well

899
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,670
I'll be careful how I say this but

900
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,859
typically they don't have the same

901
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,300
semantics as an IP address and the fact

902
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,840
that this loopback belongs to this

903
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,720
router that that sort of mapping is very

904
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,180
important to for operations so I think

905
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,060
this is well suited I'm totally in

906
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,560
agreement with you that ipv4 ipv6 you

907
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,190
know loopback addresses they should all

908
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,620
be allocated by DHCP I'm not going there

909
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:24,810
but I yield the rest of my time for

910
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,470
those who so you have another question

911
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,380
on this

912
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,540
I deserve a quick comment on all these

913
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,920
like from future way so I quite

914
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,860
understand why you have this unicast

915
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,260
DHCP DTV is very clever understanding

916
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,490
how to have backup servers and so on and

917
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,830
so forth and if you're gonna use DHCP

918
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,660
you should use DHCP which

919
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:47,279
at least all the cast if not broadcast

920
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:49,830
or whatever okay I'm totally happy with

921
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,520
that when I actually learned what v8 CP

922
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:56,040
is I will further answer that question

923
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,590
having said that I will just sort of

924
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,520
have this plug for those who are

925
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:03,810
interested in the RMR use of segments

926
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,710
roaring it's in the rest of the slides

927
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:09,960
but I'll skip that because we're wait

928
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:12,620
thank you again for giving a slot and I

929
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,620
will start a thread

930
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:33,660
thank you okay give me ten minutes okay

931
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:40,040
Ron Bonica and I'll try very hard to be

932
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:43,109
as funny as Creedy um let's go back here

933
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,750
we watched SR v6 developed for a while

934
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,710
and we talked for closer to the mic like

935
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,230
this okay

936
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:52,230
we watched SR v6 developed for a while

937
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:54,510
and we worked with customers and there

938
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,910
were parts of SR v6 we liked an awful

939
00:44:54,510 --> 00:45:00,570
lot in parts that we felt needed to be

940
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:07,230
improved upon and our response was SR v6

941
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:09,510
+ NS our v6 + we make a very distinction

942
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:13,550
between topological instructions and

943
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:17,430
service instructions taught let's say

944
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:20,330
thank you a topological instruction is

945
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:23,370
executed on a segment ingress node it

946
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:26,460
causes an action namely to forward a

947
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:28,680
packet to the segment egress node some

948
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,870
details it overwrites the ipv6

949
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,089
destination address with the destination

950
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,520
address of the egress node and it

951
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:37,920
forwards the packet to the egress node

952
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,430
either through a specified link or

953
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:45,000
thoroughly ska staff and it's encoded in

954
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:49,020
an ipv6 routing header a topological

955
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,630
instruction and SRV 6 + is the moral

956
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:54,800
equivalent of an end instruction or an

957
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:58,640
index instruction in SRV 6

958
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:02,400
by contrast a service instruction is

959
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,410
executed on the segment egress node so

960
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,630
topological is executed on the segment

961
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,890
ingress node service on the segment

962
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:12,840
egress node and there are two kinds of

963
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:15,810
service instructions one is a per

964
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,900
segment service instruction it can be

965
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:21,930
executed at the egress node of any

966
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,260
segment and typically it doesn't

967
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:27,600
influence routing an example is expose a

968
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,810
packet to a firewall rule expose a

969
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:33,210
packet to a sampling rule and we encode

970
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:36,750
these in a destination options header

971
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:39,300
that precedes the routing header another

972
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:42,840
kind of service instruction is the per

973
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:46,680
path service instruction it's executed

974
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:50,580
at the final segment egress node at the

975
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:53,669
path egress node and typically it

976
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,250
influences the d'emic demo be

977
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:58,619
encapsulated a packet and

978
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:01,890
de-multiplexing its payload for example

979
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:04,070
you get a packet pop off the ipv6 header

980
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:06,868
and all its extension headers and

981
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:10,190
forward the payload say through a

982
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:13,080
specific interface into a VPN or maybe

983
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:16,020
get the payload look up its destination

984
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,450
address in a specific VPN routing

985
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,420
instance and forward it to the next hop

986
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:23,759
you find in that routing table we encode

987
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:27,600
these in a destination options header

988
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:30,570
that precedes the upper layer header now

989
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:34,049
why decouple topological service

990
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:35,960
instructions from well topological

991
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:39,240
instructions from service instructions

992
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:43,170
well the first is so you can use the

993
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:47,160
most appropriate routing header routing

994
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:49,320
headers and or for encoding topological

995
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,970
instructions they're both intended to an

996
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,760
effect routing that's why they're called

997
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:58,350
routing headers they both execute on the

998
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:01,380
segment ingress node the do h preceding

999
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:04,109
the RH is good for per segment service

1000
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,960
instructions they can have scope beyond

1001
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:07,869
routing for instance they can carry OEM

1002
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,749
instructions

1003
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:12,579
firewall instructions and both are and

1004
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:16,058
they're executed at the right place at

1005
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:18,519
the segment egress node do H preceding

1006
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:21,009
the upper layer header are good for /

1007
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:23,788
path service instructions they can have

1008
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:29,440
scope beyond the routing header and

1009
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:32,999
they're executed at the right place we

1010
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:38,799
also have a simplified CID semantics a

1011
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:41,680
service instruction I a service

1012
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:43,660
instruction simplified identifier okay a

1013
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,210
service instruction identifier

1014
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,879
identifies a service instruction it

1015
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:51,400
appears in the do H it's not pollute

1016
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,609
polluted with CID or ipv6 address

1017
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,990
semantics a CID identifies a segment and

1018
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:58,450
the topological instruction that

1019
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:01,359
controls it it appears in the RH and

1020
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:05,348
it's not computed with si polluted with

1021
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:08,499
Si semantics or ipv6 address semantics

1022
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:10,720
an ipv6 address identifies an interface

1023
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:13,390
just the way it says it should in the

1024
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,410
ipv6 addressing architecture it's not

1025
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:19,269
polluted with SII or CID semantics an

1026
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:21,069
identifier identifies exactly one thing

1027
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:23,859
and we don't pollute our identifier z'

1028
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:26,829
with each other's semantics and we never

1029
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:28,509
copy an identifier of one type into a

1030
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:31,960
field that's meant for something else

1031
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:34,960
for instance the SID that appears on the

1032
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,900
routing header is never copied to the

1033
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,029
ipv6 destination address header there's

1034
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:44,380
a layer of indirection that mediates

1035
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:46,450
that and lets you have to go back a

1036
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,880
second let's talk about that layer of

1037
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:52,569
indirection for a second in a routing

1038
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:56,230
header when we encounter a said that's

1039
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:58,930
it as an identifier into a s fib a CID

1040
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,970
forwarding information base the CID

1041
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,730
forwarding information base has an ipv6

1042
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:06,160
address that we copy into the ipv6

1043
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,200
destination address and it has a

1044
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,700
forwarding method either forward through

1045
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:13,089
an interface or forward through a least

1046
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:16,180
cost path or whatever okay so let's do a

1047
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:20,078
little cost-benefit analysis what is the

1048
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:22,000
cost of this architecture well we have

1049
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,160
one more layer of indirect

1050
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,789
when we encounter a CID in the routing

1051
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:31,720
header we have to look in the S Feb to

1052
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:34,000
map that CID to an ipv6 address this is

1053
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,029
required to main separation between the

1054
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,430
identifier types however it's not so bad

1055
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:41,470
we've modeled this on our Asics

1056
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:43,538
and we find that even with that extra

1057
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:47,828
lookup we can still forward at line

1058
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:52,720
speed another problem is we have one

1059
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:57,569
more routing routing header type s our

1060
00:50:52,720 --> 00:51:01,240
v6 defines the SRH we define a CR h

1061
00:50:57,569 --> 00:51:03,160
they're both ipv6 routing headers but

1062
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:07,359
our routing header type a simpler has

1063
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:11,038
fewer fields in it it only has one field

1064
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:13,509
that does not also appear in the SRH

1065
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,880
what are the benefits well we have a

1066
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:18,599
simplified routing header we have no

1067
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,549
need for the tag field no need for tlvs

1068
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,799
thus it identifies but does not contain

1069
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:25,299
an instruction

1070
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:30,400
therefore the SID can be encoded in

1071
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:32,500
relatively few bits because the CID is

1072
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,690
short the RH can be short the routing

1073
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:39,569
header can be short even when the SID

1074
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:43,299
contains a long list of segments and

1075
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:45,849
there's no need to augment ipv6 om

1076
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:48,490
because what appears in the ipv6

1077
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:52,150
destination address is always an ipv6

1078
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:54,250
address paying traceroute they all work

1079
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:57,809
because from the point of view of the

1080
00:51:54,250 --> 00:52:00,880
ipv6 header nothing has changed

1081
00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:07,690
more benefits is you can do some

1082
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:12,329
mix-and-match with routing headers and

1083
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:17,109
destination options for instance let's

1084
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:19,450
let's say that you want a packet to be

1085
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:21,038
demultiplexed at the end point but you

1086
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,919
want it to travel the least cost path

1087
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:25,750
from ingress to egress well all you need

1088
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,299
is the destination option options header

1089
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:31,210
you don't need a routing header at all

1090
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:33,730
let's say you want a packet to be

1091
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,890
traffic engineered from ingress to

1092
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,289
egress

1093
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:40,500
but once it gets to the egress you'd

1094
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:43,710
like standard RFC 8200 demultiplexing

1095
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:47,069
behavior for instance you'd like to use

1096
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:48,569
oh maybe a VX land header at the end

1097
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:49,980
point fine

1098
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:53,130
use the routing header omit the

1099
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,940
destination options setter mix and match

1100
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:57,630
as an option

1101
00:52:53,940 --> 00:53:01,170
another benefit if you want to use the

1102
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:05,309
full set of ipv6 extension headers you

1103
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:08,460
can right now the segment routing header

1104
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:11,789
draft says the authentication header is

1105
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,440
undefined with the SRH and this strategy

1106
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:18,510
the authentication header works just

1107
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:21,269
fine so you get overall simplicity the

1108
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:26,849
existing draft covers the subject in

1109
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:30,328
relatively few pages and here now

1110
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:32,250
granted this was done before this was

1111
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:33,690
submitted on the same day that the micro

1112
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,660
set was submitted so this doesn't take

1113
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:40,339
microsite into consideration this

1114
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:43,529
compares the size of the SRH and the CRH

1115
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:48,750
with cid depths of various sizes

1116
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:51,690
let's take 8 as an example and the CRA

1117
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:55,019
chesed can be encoded as 16 or 32 bits

1118
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:59,849
so for an eight SIDS we're comparing 136

1119
00:53:55,019 --> 00:54:03,240
bytes with 24 and 40 so there really is

1120
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:04,740
a significant savings we have some

1121
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,069
implementations we have a complete

1122
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:10,439
implementation on Linux that's both for

1123
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:14,910
the forwarding plane and the is is

1124
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:17,880
control plane and we will have a Juno's

1125
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:21,740
proof of concept very soon and I see

1126
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,740
Ravi smiling um

1127
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:28,140
anyhow next steps I would like to bring

1128
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:32,819
the overview draft draft Bonica spring

1129
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:35,339
SR v6 + to this crap group for a call

1130
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:37,680
for acceptance and in six-man there are

1131
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:41,009
three other drafts one that describes

1132
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,288
the CRH the routing header one that

1133
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:46,200
describes the destination option option

1134
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:47,260
header at the end that's the VPN desktop

1135
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,230
ssin header

1136
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:54,850
and one that describes the destination

1137
00:54:50,230 --> 00:55:00,030
option header along early segments that

1138
00:54:54,850 --> 00:55:00,029
second point those will be presented in

1139
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:08,710
six-man tomorrow and at that point I'll

1140
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:11,830
go to questions I won though that's

1141
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:15,670
because they are the hopefully the

1142
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:17,350
products for this walk I'm sorry could

1143
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:20,320
you say that again I mean so the you

1144
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:22,420
their angular control Canaan walk yes

1145
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,100
there is control plane work in fact I

1146
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,680
think I have a list of no I don't have

1147
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,410
associated drafts there was an is is

1148
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:33,279
extension that was presented in LS are

1149
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:38,920
there are IDR extensions by Sri Hari and

1150
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:42,400
IDR and Alliston Andrew Allison has

1151
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,560
another IDR draft the one that's missing

1152
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:49,360
is OSPF that has to be done by the next

1153
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:54,220
IDF so my comments are follows so first

1154
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:57,070
in our opinion because we I think Edessa

1155
00:55:54,220 --> 00:56:01,240
you the the purpose of order usage of

1156
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:04,420
the SRH or the SR video as re-save class

1157
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:08,830
I think maybe the similar I think a you

1158
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:12,550
philosophy the infer information carried

1159
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:14,880
by the packet is a Yukon no matter you

1160
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:18,910
to encapsulated the SI actual or

1161
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:21,820
encapsulated the future class the RH so

1162
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:25,140
I think there is a from this point of

1163
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:28,030
view I think you as are actually the

1164
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:32,049
already deployable or already

1165
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:34,960
implemented there did we need another

1166
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:38,830
set of the future of the effort to

1167
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:41,340
define the new set of the control knie

1168
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:45,009
are the forward in place the question is

1169
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:50,530
is the incremental improvement of SR v6

1170
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:52,420
+ / sr v6 sufficient to justify the work

1171
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:56,470
and I'll leave that question for the

1172
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:59,680
working group to answer ok i think that

1173
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:00,560
ii upon to you that for the shorter days

1174
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,549
of the header

1175
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:07,549
from our point of view if you compress

1176
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:10,310
that one butter you master to introduces

1177
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:12,980
a state in the foreign inflamed because

1178
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:15,710
you must a map at the cedar to sum the

1179
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:19,010
ipv6 address I said absolutely that's

1180
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:23,240
what the s fib is but it is not her path

1181
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:27,080
state is per segment state and given

1182
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:29,419
that that state is easy to to propagate

1183
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,210
it's not so bad if you take a look at

1184
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:37,660
the is is draft it's actually a subset

1185
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:40,790
of the SRH is is support I think

1186
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:43,190
different of ramen this is the design

1187
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:46,460
original design the purpose the 4s are

1188
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:48,530
actually the state release I justices

1189
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:51,320
that's one the set upon I won't say that

1190
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:54,140
for the shorter header I know that's why

1191
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:57,500
in fact and you now we can already

1192
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,569
supported up to ten layers of the SRD

1193
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,190
see it's the segmented stack from our

1194
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:04,160
point of view I think this and not a

1195
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:07,190
bigger usual so I think that's the evil

1196
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,620
you synced as if you needed to compress

1197
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:13,040
that the SI reaction I think we also

1198
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:16,520
need a measure that we the elite oppress

1199
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:21,860
instead of a huge amount okay you saying

1200
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:25,750
you support ten SIDS and SRH that's a

1201
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,900
hundred sixty eight byte header yeah

1202
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:33,020
okay

1203
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:36,230
Jim Jim Iran Jim gives your future a

1204
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:41,150
couple of comments you mentioned about

1205
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:43,160
the note e of ease required so as you

1206
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,230
know there's plenty of use cases where

1207
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,839
we may want to carry metadata with the

1208
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:52,310
packet and obviously right now we would

1209
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:54,350
use the tail v in the s rh to do so if

1210
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:56,779
you remove that then you've got to carry

1211
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:58,880
it somewhere right and what concerns me

1212
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,220
is if you're going to carry that before

1213
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,150
the routing header that could be very

1214
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,160
very large

1215
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:05,900
before you even get to the routing

1216
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,520
header to be able to do any kind of

1217
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:11,510
forward in operation so that's something

1218
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,580
to consider if it's short then you'd go

1219
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,710
with the destination before the routing

1220
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:18,650
if it's long we're not trying to compete

1221
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:21,440
with nsh no no that's not my point my

1222
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:24,440
point is that your slide said you don't

1223
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,390
need T RVs right we don't we don't have

1224
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,610
cases where you probably do unless you

1225
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:31,100
want to carry it before the routing

1226
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,780
header and if you do that then you know

1227
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:35,930
that introduces a problem in and of

1228
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:39,470
itself yeah if if metadata is bigger

1229
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:43,460
than that and it's time for the nsh okay

1230
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:46,100
the second comment I made is and as this

1231
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:48,350
slide it's a little bit misleading but I

1232
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,630
think you said that yourself because

1233
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:52,970
there are ways very simple ways to

1234
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:55,370
compress the segment list just so

1235
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:58,220
happens that that hasn't been pursued up

1236
00:59:55,370 --> 01:00:02,630
until this point so the the use of these

1237
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:04,730
one there's another actually simpler way

1238
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:06,530
of doing it that just got published as

1239
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,120
well and they'll give any kind of

1240
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:11,180
mapping neither of those were published

1241
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:14,299
at the time so we need to compare it

1242
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:16,759
with that as well as human that that we

1243
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,530
can do that compression with a second

1244
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,870
place and it kind of overcomes that yeah

1245
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:24,950
that's for the next next presentation

1246
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:26,779
Tony Tony P jeepers yes I think this

1247
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:29,720
address is to elephants in the room

1248
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:33,230
which so far have been you know painted

1249
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:37,520
translucent one is that the five G

1250
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:39,110
bandwidth is not free right so it's

1251
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,270
wonderful you can build something that

1252
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:44,990
does it no 200 bytes headers and maybe

1253
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:46,430
even steam power it but ultimately the

1254
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,750
amount of header you carry will

1255
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,819
determine the economics of your

1256
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:51,920
bandwidth and not only of your bandwidth

1257
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,600
but also we have a limited amount of

1258
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,060
power it can push into Iraq and then

1259
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,890
limit the amount of gates right so they

1260
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:00,890
will determine how dense you can deploy

1261
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:03,290
something so it is an issue it just

1262
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,759
determines your economic how much of the

1263
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:07,160
bandwidth you carry you charge the

1264
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,290
customer and how much is just funky

1265
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,120
overhead you are you caring so do one

1266
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:14,330
consideration the other consideration is

1267
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:19,220
this is decoupling the service from the

1268
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:22,960
transport right which admittedly is not

1269
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:26,000
only how we scaled networks up right

1270
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,530
it's also something that tends to

1271
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,420
protect you

1272
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:32,660
you have a really large networks and

1273
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:35,810
something's usually melts out right the

1274
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:38,629
layers prevent you from having one huge

1275
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:40,880
telephony switch that is crooks

1276
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:46,580
connecting the whole planet and you have

1277
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:48,260
to reprogram an se failures so whether

1278
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,700
this solution we were on something else

1279
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,890
I think this is just addressing those

1280
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,500
two big elephants in the room that so

1281
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:55,339
far happen just pretend not to exist

1282
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:59,630
Thanks

1283
01:01:55,340 --> 01:02:02,840
thank you I don't guard Agra a LinkedIn

1284
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:05,480
I'm speaking as an operator the the

1285
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,100
whole idea of actually having SRH is

1286
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,930
already implemented into a yard where's

1287
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,310
it's already out there with customer

1288
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:12,890
deployments with very large scale

1289
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:14,930
deployments and then also as you

1290
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:16,730
admittedly said there is a micro set

1291
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:20,359
which is there which will help with

1292
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:22,610
efficiency of MTU I don't see any reason

1293
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,170
of having another routing header there

1294
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,370
isn't anything which is being added in

1295
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,580
fact I think there is a bit of a

1296
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:31,220
complexity being added over here by

1297
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:33,350
adding another header over multiple

1298
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:35,330
other headers we have and even for

1299
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:38,150
service chaining as you're saying we

1300
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:40,790
need another header which is nsh so I'm

1301
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:44,660
very interested to hear technical

1302
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:47,150
objections the objection that there is

1303
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:49,850
already another solution I'd like to

1304
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:52,130
draw an analogy once a man had a horse

1305
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:54,230
and he said his horse does everything

1306
01:02:52,130 --> 01:03:02,240
that the automobile does already so he

1307
01:02:54,230 --> 01:03:04,990
doesn't need an automobile that's fine

1308
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,149
but there is already there is already

1309
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:09,910
but it is already that automobile

1310
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:11,680
already has multiple versions out there

1311
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:15,770
okay

1312
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:18,399
Tom so I'm wondering what your view is

1313
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:21,020
on the relationship between this and

1314
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,360
canonical segment routing is is this

1315
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:25,340
intended to be complementary would it be

1316
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,080
a drop-in replacement for the network

1317
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:30,710
programming I'm sorry I missed a word

1318
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:33,770
between this end segment segment routing

1319
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:38,120
proper that's our MPLS so is a

1320
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:39,860
complimentary two to be a follow-on how

1321
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,960
does it interact with all of the rest of

1322
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,050
the segment it's

1323
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,829
it's a complimentary spelled both ways

1324
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:51,069
it's complimentary and that both should

1325
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:53,950
exist both work for some sums group of

1326
01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:58,540
customers and it's complimentary in that

1327
01:03:53,950 --> 01:04:02,250
the SR v6 + architecture mimics the SR

1328
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:08,700
MPLS architecture in ways that s our v6

1329
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:11,260
does not SR v6 + mimics SR MPLS in that

1330
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:15,730
topological instructions are executed on

1331
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:18,670
the ingress node it mimics it in many

1332
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:21,460
other ways that s our v6 diverges from

1333
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:25,630
it so is the implication of the +

1334
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:27,970
meaning this is somehow superset no it's

1335
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:32,319
complementary with the complements been

1336
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:37,660
spelled both ways women Oh Bob's next

1337
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:41,920
really good tonight after I Bob ended so

1338
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:44,828
I'm here with my six-man co-chair hat so

1339
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,770
I would like to ideally I would like to

1340
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:49,770
hear clear feedback on this from the

1341
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:52,390
spring working group as the weather year

1342
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:54,040
this is going to progress or you're

1343
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:55,299
interested or something or you're not it

1344
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:59,500
might be more importantly you're not

1345
01:04:55,299 --> 01:05:02,980
interested so we don't have to repeat

1346
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:05,859
all these talks forever in six-man - so

1347
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,480
be good if you could figure out how

1348
01:05:05,859 --> 01:05:09,339
you're going to decide how to deal with

1349
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,770
this or not I I don't have a strong

1350
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:13,500
opinion one way or the other but we

1351
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:17,490
would like to know thank you

1352
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:19,510
okay women we magnetics from McKeon so

1353
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:20,828
if you look to the current state of

1354
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,230
affairs with as our v6

1355
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:25,930
I think there is multiple proposals what

1356
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:28,000
what has been done so far you see that

1357
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:29,828
if you really implement with full

1358
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,720
flexibility there is probably some

1359
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:33,790
performance penalties you will have in

1360
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,669
certain hardware elements if you want to

1361
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:39,970
run them at high speed all right I think

1362
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,440
the the question I have is and this is

1363
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:43,808
mainly question to the working group not

1364
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,299
directly to yourself is you will see

1365
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:49,240
that we need probably an optimization

1366
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:53,020
from what we have today with Azure v6

1367
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:55,649
right meaning as a rich base right

1368
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:58,300
- something more optimal which is more

1369
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:00,369
performant and doesn't have the those

1370
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:02,170
drawbacks potentially and in certain

1371
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:04,240
hardware element and the question to the

1372
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:06,700
working group will be do we want to

1373
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,729
adopt multiple of these options or do we

1374
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:12,310
want to have a discussion okay which one

1375
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:13,810
is the most preferred more optimal and

1376
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,210
more hardware friendly rather than

1377
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:18,220
trying to boil the ocean and come up

1378
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,869
with multiple multiple alternatives

1379
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:24,868
because if you look to what you are

1380
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:27,940
proposing here there is today even

1381
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:29,980
working on complement its MPLS based but

1382
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:33,240
it uses so it's segment routing and

1383
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:35,920
pella's over UDP which is using a v6

1384
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:38,350
destination address which is actually

1385
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,520
doing exactly what you do here it is

1386
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:44,770
using MPLS and cooling but it uses

1387
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,020
32-bit which is an MPLS label which is

1388
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:49,990
actually doing more or less the same

1389
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,340
thing what you have here and the

1390
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:54,939
questions which I have to the working

1391
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:56,530
group is mainly do we want to adopt like

1392
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:58,869
all of these different options because

1393
01:06:56,530 --> 01:07:00,430
we'll end up implementing all of them if

1394
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:02,050
we have multiple options and I don't

1395
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:04,089
think we do an industry a favor

1396
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:06,190
because we will end up competing into

1397
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:08,530
the market and we will have to implement

1398
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,540
them all and it will take a longer time

1399
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:13,450
to actually adopt that towards the

1400
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:16,090
industry so it's more working group type

1401
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:18,160
of computer bring it brings up an

1402
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:22,780
interesting question there are three

1403
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:26,710
ways we can go we can have a shootout

1404
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:31,390
among options we can try to merge

1405
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:34,630
options or we can let all options grow

1406
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:36,100
and let the market decide right so this

1407
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,920
is a clear question to the working group

1408
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:41,710
ian's yeah I think we I give us exactly

1409
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:43,420
the last call question yes and I even

1410
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,130
work group adoption question I think the

1411
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:47,470
question is actually what does the

1412
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:49,780
working group wants to get out of this I

1413
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:52,660
do believe that there is an optimization

1414
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:55,210
required from what we have today and I

1415
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,069
would be of the opinion to basically try

1416
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:59,140
to come up with one proposal on how to

1417
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:01,420
do that optimization rather than trying

1418
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:06,549
to follow the ocean and let the market

1419
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:08,560
decide okay Andrew I'll say

1420
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,730
at front I was a co-author of this but

1421
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:14,860
I'm going to take that hat off for a

1422
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:18,279
second and speak as an operator when we

1423
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:20,620
got involved in this draft we did so

1424
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:24,370
because we looked at the network that we

1425
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:27,130
run today and frh with the overheads

1426
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:28,960
when we get the calculations on our

1427
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:30,670
package per second rates and the

1428
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,859
overheads and the numbers of since we

1429
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:34,690
were stacking and everything else the

1430
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:37,750
overheads were untenable keep in mind

1431
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:39,818
though I run a very large network in a

1432
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:41,830
place where bandwidth is not expecting

1433
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:43,750
it is not cheap you know there were

1434
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:46,899
places where I'm not getting bandwidth

1435
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:50,080
the 20 cents a mega pay $50 a MEK that

1436
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:53,740
overhead starts having real impact at

1437
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,870
points and so when we started looking at

1438
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:58,479
this I just wanted to say that that cost

1439
01:08:55,870 --> 01:09:02,470
of that overhead has a fundamental

1440
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:05,318
impact and we talk about operators and

1441
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:08,170
operator positions within the working

1442
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:11,350
group - as the previous speaker was

1443
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:15,700
talking about from my perspective as an

1444
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:19,170
operator I could not justify deployment

1445
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:22,630
of SRH today because of the overhead and

1446
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:24,940
when I look at the other things with

1447
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:27,130
regards to this drop I know exactly how

1448
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:29,559
with this draft I can stitch between l1

1449
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:32,529
and l2 segments I know that the Strasse

1450
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,930
is not going to inflate my IGP which

1451
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:37,450
could happen potentially with lightness

1452
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:39,670
it drops there are a number of other

1453
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:42,130
issues but I just wanted to say that as

1454
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:44,170
an operator that's why we got involved

1455
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:47,080
in this because we looked at it and

1456
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:49,660
looking at the market that I operate in

1457
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:51,910
and the very large network that we

1458
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:55,300
operate across all of those countries I

1459
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:57,639
couldn't I could not work with SRH in

1460
01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:03,100
its current form and I saw what because

1461
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:06,550
of the overhead conclude things first we

1462
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:10,620
could Zeleny for so we could delay

1463
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:10,620
before you because right

1464
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,370
okay we don't you know be briefed on

1465
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,860
short okay so I say you know there's a

1466
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:23,309
career that's the

1467
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:25,769
the operators opinion so my opinion sau

1468
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:28,860
the week I used the messer that the

1469
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:30,690
elite who press so that's the first the

1470
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,450
second or I think that is regarding

1471
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:35,370
these of the key loading efficiency

1472
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:38,220
usual I think this they are so the

1473
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:40,910
possible way like the Pythian cedar or

1474
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:43,740
some other can solve this one and also

1475
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:46,680
we see in Cadiz the pillow the

1476
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:49,320
efficiency but I think or five years ago

1477
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:51,690
the Akio the thunders of the label had

1478
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:55,200
the usual by the weary trail will trail

1479
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:58,379
back the ipv6 we should not renew the

1480
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:00,900
sixteen bias at the crest or maybe we

1481
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:07,590
need a lot of the external header but we

1482
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:09,480
must agree the requirement so just a

1483
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:11,970
comments about the name of the solution

1484
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,370
so based on my understanding about this

1485
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:16,680
craft I think it's a different from the

1486
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:19,220
current service a so I think it's better

1487
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:21,270
to have another name for this assertion

1488
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:25,380
I'm sorry I didn't understand the last

1489
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:27,420
thing you said yeah it's better have

1490
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,350
another name for this oh I couldn't call

1491
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:35,220
it anything you like

1492
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:37,230
you know David Melman from Marbella am I

1493
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:42,300
totally identify with the the issue of

1494
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:43,679
the the size of the the cid list and you

1495
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,350
know Marbella the silicon vendor we

1496
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,900
certainly see the pain points as well in

1497
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:51,420
supporting a large sit list but I'm

1498
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:54,960
wondering whether the approach of doing

1499
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:59,010
MPLS SR MPLS over IP couldn't isn't

1500
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:00,960
already an acceptable solution for doing

1501
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:04,980
sort of the compressing Lee the CID list

1502
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:07,470
using MPLS labels as assets well that's

1503
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:11,730
an argument and in that case for getting

1504
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:13,290
rid of both SR v6 + sr v 6 + we see that

1505
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:15,599
there are some operators one who just

1506
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:19,470
stood up who is going to make his case

1507
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,790
for needing an 86 okay I'm gonna read

1508
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:23,940
his mind he's gonna make his case for

1509
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:26,700
ipv6 as is exactly the case that

1510
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:30,330
everyone who's spoken in favor of SR v6

1511
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:31,230
+ thing they need an ipv6 they state

1512
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:35,760
data plane

1513
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:37,379
well SRM pls over IP supports an ipv6

1514
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:42,960
data plane correct in terms of the

1515
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:45,600
forwarding well more than that okay so

1516
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,490
you asked for adoption we think it's too

1517
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,650
early

1518
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:51,269
okay could I ask those could I ask at

1519
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:56,759
least for the reviews to get it on the

1520
01:12:51,270 --> 01:13:01,050
on the path or at least people what's

1521
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:04,920
that yeah but he went on the line after

1522
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:06,840
because that I enjoy to be fair so the

1523
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,450
rule is the same for everyone okay so

1524
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:13,410
what would the next steps be so it's too

1525
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:15,389
it's too early for work sensing for my

1526
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:19,470
concealer or any other extension for

1527
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:22,560
sanding just to remind the working we

1528
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:27,570
already have a solution music that

1529
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:29,640
depend on its color Savi 6rh suppose six

1530
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:33,330
man on spring I've been working for five

1531
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:37,200
years on it so we starting from scratch

1532
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:39,450
we do have a solution so if it's not

1533
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:41,309
good enough or something is missing we

1534
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:45,450
need to understand exactly what the

1535
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:48,110
issue is so is it specific to a specific

1536
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:51,510
deployment needing a lot of seeds so

1537
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:53,219
coming back to your pure figure what is

1538
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,800
the limit what the norm of seeds you

1539
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:58,860
need same questions wind with

1540
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,930
implementation what exactly are also

1541
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:04,500
limits other constraints is it specific

1542
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:07,530
to one implementation or is the issue is

1543
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:10,170
a large for all industry so winds

1544
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:12,269
we need one is not the problem compared

1545
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:16,290
to what we have both the service six on

1546
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:18,780
SRM pls and then we can discuss if we

1547
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:20,700
agree that there is a problem on we

1548
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:23,790
agree on the constraint then we can

1549
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:26,250
discuss so we'd ask them for people who

1550
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:27,180
see a need for something else to speak

1551
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:30,780
up on the list

1552
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:33,900
yes but they need to understand to

1553
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:36,690
specify our example this is a wonder

1554
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:39,509
what is their limitation what was the

1555
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:40,830
problem something for deployment what is

1556
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:43,850
the requirement determine of number of

1557
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:45,559
theta because in the end we will have to

1558
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:49,100
and if he goes what is the right value

1559
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:51,410
for the city for us I guess it was easy

1560
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:54,590
we took the size of the embedded seat

1561
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:58,970
which is 20 bits for a service 6 we

1562
01:14:54,590 --> 01:15:02,030
choose a ipv6 address which is 128 if we

1563
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:05,750
define a new seed on our own we have to

1564
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:08,030
choose the values the size so we know we

1565
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:12,020
have to know the constraints okay so

1566
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:13,969
that sounds like not so much a mandate

1567
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:16,280
from the chair to go away but let's

1568
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:17,810
bring the conversation to the list yes

1569
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:20,929
we need to understand what what is the

1570
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:24,260
problem compared to a service 6rh in

1571
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:31,760
working on 4 5 0 on SR MPLS on SR

1572
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:32,330
impedance in UDP so we are ok done

1573
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,950
already

1574
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:36,350
I just want to make sure that I

1575
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:37,580
understand the direction I don't have a

1576
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,840
comment for Ron I just want make sure

1577
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,930
that it's in the direction that you're

1578
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:45,740
setting what I think you said is that

1579
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:49,300
for now the workgroup has a solution but

1580
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:51,250
we want to understand if there are holes

1581
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:53,630
whatever something needs to be done

1582
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:56,360
which sounds like you're leaving the

1583
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:59,210
door open to say we could have a

1584
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:01,880
different solution is that I mean after

1585
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:05,080
a proper discussion in here I think the

1586
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:07,100
challenge is we probably don't want any

1587
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,510
improvements over time right it's fine

1588
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,620
for us to look at technology and say hey

1589
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:10,790
this is not right but we need to

1590
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,530
understand what the constraints you want

1591
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:13,760
to engineer within are like two boys the

1592
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:15,710
product the set of problems we're going

1593
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,210
to solve what the constraints are and

1594
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:19,730
then let's look at the solutions that we

1595
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:21,410
have out there and say a is the

1596
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:23,179
advantage of them significant enough

1597
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:26,330
that they're worth progressing called

1598
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:28,460
like adding into the industry or and if

1599
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:31,100
if they are then we progressive if not

1600
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:33,080
you should but we don't want I think for

1601
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,330
a nice yesterday we don't want ok like

1602
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:38,980
his sov 6 plus and here's s7b 6 plus

1603
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:41,630
plus and his IP 6 plus plus plus that

1604
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:44,750
works perfectly for me I just want to

1605
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:47,030
point out that I believe that six men

1606
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:52,490
already working group that's called and

1607
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:55,519
sent to the ASG the SRH document so if

1608
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:57,599
we are going to think about it maybe we

1609
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,659
need to let so

1610
01:16:57,599 --> 01:17:05,310
whose power is possible for that draft

1611
01:16:59,659 --> 01:17:08,190
know that a little bit doesn't mean stop

1612
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:10,050
completely it means as you said we might

1613
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:12,199
think about it for a little bit and then

1614
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:15,599
go back and say yes keep going or

1615
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:18,169
something I don't it again that's why I

1616
01:17:15,599 --> 01:17:20,969
want to clarify what we are thinking I

1617
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:24,540
think we have I think that's an

1618
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:26,219
interesting position right those so for

1619
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:28,800
us to say that we need to say the

1620
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:30,889
current SR v6 ISM actually useful right

1621
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,599
and I think that we're not necessarily

1622
01:17:30,889 --> 01:17:35,070
the there's it didn't sound like you're

1623
01:17:33,599 --> 01:17:36,810
saying entirely that you think it the

1624
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:38,130
existing thing is not useful I think

1625
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:40,829
you're pointing out limitations and then

1626
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:43,050
potentially improvements on top well I I

1627
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:46,799
tried very hard to be neutral towards

1628
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:49,949
existing SSR v6 the one thing that I'm

1629
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,750
most concerned about is that because

1630
01:17:49,949 --> 01:17:54,388
we've gotten where we are we are now

1631
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:57,119
ossified and that we will obstruct any

1632
01:17:54,389 --> 01:18:00,030
more progress i wanted assurance we're

1633
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:05,040
not there with that assurance I'm fine

1634
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:08,309
with SRH progressing is Krishnan talking

1635
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:10,739
us into ad 84 six men so I'll tell you

1636
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:12,929
what my working assumption is okay so my

1637
01:18:10,739 --> 01:18:15,119
assumption is I'm sending sr v6 forward

1638
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:16,320
unless I like hear screaming from the

1639
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,000
spring side so that's my working

1640
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,369
assumption like I'm I finished my ad

1641
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,409
eval like the others are fixing the

1642
01:18:20,369 --> 01:18:23,790
stuff and it's gonna go into ITF last

1643
01:18:22,409 --> 01:18:27,269
call so that's how I see it

1644
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:29,909
and we also gated nes our v6 related at

1645
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:31,409
work in six-man until the sr h was done

1646
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:32,790
okay so there's like a bunch of drafts

1647
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:35,129
that it's going to get some air time

1648
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:38,010
tomorrow like talking about extensions

1649
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:40,099
today okay so maybe that's something we

1650
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:42,449
can play with but I really would be

1651
01:18:40,099 --> 01:18:42,989
worried about pulling the plug on this

1652
01:18:42,449 --> 01:18:45,150
at this time

1653
01:18:42,989 --> 01:18:46,919
okay so analysis like some catastrophic

1654
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:48,420
even telling me like oh like this is

1655
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,940
like we totally screwed ah blah blah

1656
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:53,790
blah I'm sending this forward like as

1657
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:56,369
the ad for that and the second thing is

1658
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:57,900
like Bob kind of alluded to this right

1659
01:18:56,369 --> 01:19:00,780
like we are kind of looking for guidance

1660
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:02,309
from spring to see how s our v6 +

1661
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:04,559
related work is going to happen in

1662
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:06,030
six-man so like we are expecting spring

1663
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,130
to say like hey like you're considering

1664
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:10,949
this da da da so we can then we say can

1665
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:11,209
you do like headers or like options and

1666
01:19:10,949 --> 01:19:13,759
six

1667
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:16,219
literally 6 plus so similar like we are

1668
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,900
we're treating SR and si we 6 plus the

1669
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:19,550
same way so spring tells us like this is

1670
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,679
that picture we are considering it now

1671
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:23,209
do the things for that right like I have

1672
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,119
this chat wrong as well right

1673
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:26,599
so the idea is like so the SRB seat

1674
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:29,239
stuff

1675
01:19:26,599 --> 01:19:31,449
the SRH is going forward like unless

1676
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:35,150
like something drastically changes and

1677
01:19:31,449 --> 01:19:36,379
all the add-on work for SL v6 is going

1678
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:37,938
to be considered at some point right

1679
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:39,139
like you don't know when if we're just

1680
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:40,969
doing lightning talks at this point

1681
01:19:39,139 --> 01:19:42,530
because we get at this for two years so

1682
01:19:40,969 --> 01:19:44,689
that's kind of my working assumption so

1683
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:47,119
if you think some office off like you

1684
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:49,309
know kind of taught me and the six

1685
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:50,688
million shares and so so I know like you

1686
01:19:49,309 --> 01:19:52,789
guys had a good conversation on how we

1687
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:54,619
distribute the work between six nine and

1688
01:19:52,789 --> 01:20:11,030
spring but I think if something has

1689
01:19:54,619 --> 01:20:13,670
changed like we would like no hi I'm

1690
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:15,860
Daniel void from Bell Canada and I'm

1691
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:20,420
going to be presenting the asabi 6 micro

1692
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:22,688
said on behalf of a few authors to say

1693
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:22,689
the least

1694
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:40,070
okay so the srvs magazine concept is a

1695
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:42,860
new network programming set behavior it

1696
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:45,320
follows the normal and that are already

1697
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:48,079
defined it's seamlessly combined with

1698
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:49,728
the other method gave EUR it's fully

1699
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:52,639
integrated with the network programming

1700
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:55,849
and the SRH and it offers incrementals

1701
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:58,099
for deployment in SRV six network it

1702
01:20:55,849 --> 01:21:02,110
also enable there's a v6 scaling for

1703
01:20:58,099 --> 01:21:06,670
massive network with optimizing to you

1704
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:06,670
so how does the work yeah

1705
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:14,480
so the Mackinac Blessed behavior it's

1706
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:17,150
another variant of the Antoine behavior

1707
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,669
it's a ad bit argument that contains the

1708
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:20,179
next macro said in the macro said

1709
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:23,059
carrier

1710
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:25,429
so basically upon receiving a packet

1711
01:21:23,059 --> 01:21:27,800
whose ipv6 destination address is a

1712
01:21:25,429 --> 01:21:30,440
local Mackinac it said the node would

1713
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:33,739
perform the following the 16-bit

1714
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:36,199
following the active macro said with

1715
01:21:33,739 --> 01:21:41,299
inside the destination address if it's

1716
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:45,019
set to zero then it will shift the 48

1717
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:49,369
200 into a bit 2 by 16 bit to the left

1718
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:52,849
and then it will set the last 16 bit to

1719
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:54,980
0 then we'll forward otherwise we'll

1720
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:58,190
execute the end to the code and that's

1721
01:21:54,980 --> 01:22:01,428
pretty much what we have to understand

1722
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:03,259
from the micro said the n2 the code is

1723
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:07,670
defined in the section for the one of

1724
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:12,590
the network programming draft so few

1725
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:14,750
benefits just like any other service our

1726
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:16,760
v6 and point behavior it's a new

1727
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:20,780
instruction for the SR v6 network

1728
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:23,780
programming it's SRH compliant there's

1729
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:27,159
no new ipv6 extension required it has

1730
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:31,309
some efficiency in terms of empty usage

1731
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:34,308
it's scalable for the SRECs with 18

1732
01:22:31,309 --> 01:22:39,409
source routing we point in a 40-bit 40

1733
01:22:34,309 --> 01:22:42,440
byte SRH sorry the version that we just

1734
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:44,900
published last Monday the little

1735
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:47,928
difference is the last bullet here we

1736
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:51,829
made it any ipv6 block available to

1737
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:52,940
Annabel can be used instead of the ule

1738
01:22:51,829 --> 01:22:57,650
that's the difference between the

1739
01:22:52,940 --> 01:23:01,428
version 0 in division 1 re benefits

1740
01:22:57,650 --> 01:23:04,129
it's our friendly so for us a lot of

1741
01:23:01,429 --> 01:23:09,230
operator there one from my previous

1742
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:11,869
slides it's kind of key that that we can

1743
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:15,348
be in control of the asabi 6 appointment

1744
01:23:11,869 --> 01:23:17,210
on the legacy platform as as an example

1745
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:19,579
the Jericho one and orderly gives a

1746
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:21,230
platform that exists so if you if we

1747
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:23,540
have already these platform in the field

1748
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:25,339
now with this option in this

1749
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,280
proposal we can keep running a savvy

1750
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:30,260
success deployment there is no control

1751
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:31,730
it's pretty much control differently

1752
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:37,030
there's no mapping table there is no

1753
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:41,330
writing extension regard that's it

1754
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:43,849
the before before we go to questions I

1755
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:47,150
think most of the comments on the

1756
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:49,730
compressed either applies to you to the

1757
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:53,960
proposal so thirsty what is the problem

1758
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:57,320
exactly with SRS or SIDS we need to

1759
01:23:53,960 --> 01:24:00,830
define it so there are number of claims

1760
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:05,269
every every time sites are web friendly

1761
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:07,820
but site was supposed to work so it's

1762
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:09,170
forcing horizontal plates so we need to

1763
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:09,650
understand exactly what what is the

1764
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:13,190
problem

1765
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:15,110
so the SRH were supposed it is working

1766
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:18,070
on many platform we have a couple we

1767
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:20,839
have a draft that shows some deployment

1768
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:23,000
but it's more on the legacy platform and

1769
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:25,190
anyone that has some Jericho wants and

1770
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,310
their networks unless there's something

1771
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:30,860
specific with some vendor or some other

1772
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:34,820
legacy platform will be able to run a

1773
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:36,500
saw v6 with those proposal Devon but we

1774
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:39,769
knew that when we definitely Raj

1775
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:41,540
we knew the size and Suraj we knew that

1776
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:47,240
those legacy platform will not support

1777
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:50,090
it so what you so just dare nukes Cisco

1778
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:52,730
Systems the just want to point out that

1779
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:55,460
there's the this still uses the SRH as

1780
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:59,450
its defined it doesn't change that

1781
01:24:55,460 --> 01:25:03,290
yes RHS RFC I can carry microsites there

1782
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:07,160
just to CID like any other CID the SRH

1783
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:08,420
draft also says that additional suits

1784
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,370
can be defined in the future and it

1785
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,050
gives a way of defining those suits this

1786
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:15,610
is this is just another SID

1787
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:19,850
so it's it's normal operation for SR v6

1788
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:22,700
yes we use this a rich from the design

1789
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:26,270
its it does change forwarding on ipv6

1790
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:29,000
packet and that's even be played music

1791
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:30,530
packet because just like so like any

1792
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,520
other you look at is their agent you

1793
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:37,219
know well except for the other part that

1794
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:39,350
says else execute the end pseudocode the

1795
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:41,030
and pseudocode describes how the SRH is

1796
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:43,610
processed and they believe there's a

1797
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:45,950
reference in the draft to the to the

1798
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:48,650
programming craft as well so yes sir H

1799
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:52,760
is used within a with by a micro said if

1800
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:54,440
its present reusing the cirrage does not

1801
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:56,600
say that doesn't mean that we don't

1802
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:58,940
change anything them for my IP six don't

1803
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:01,640
point so ya know if we work on that we

1804
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:04,549
we need to work with six pen tool to see

1805
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:06,410
if it's fine for my success and in a

1806
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:09,980
joke and hit it yeah this is just

1807
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:14,990
another it's just another sit maybe I'm

1808
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:17,839
not following the question it's as any

1809
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:20,410
other city receive it you process it you

1810
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:23,450
do the action thats it says to take and

1811
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:28,550
go to the next city which is carrying

1812
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:30,830
the arguments okay

1813
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:34,100
Chung from Maui and first of all I think

1814
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:38,540
it is the right direction to enhanced as

1815
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:42,110
a HBase s up the six case we what are we

1816
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:45,320
has done in the right in the same way

1817
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:48,349
but I don't think this solution is

1818
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:50,690
flexible enough cuz each time when you

1819
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:54,380
introduce a new ceased and you have to

1820
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:57,139
make toys implementation for the normal

1821
01:26:54,380 --> 01:27:01,340
seed and you seated right and that all

1822
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:04,310
the seeds would introduce the the root

1823
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:08,600
which means the roots are knitted 4-h

1824
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:14,570
seats including the you seed no and you

1825
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:16,670
see such as HSN C HSN Cu CT yep so my

1826
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:19,630
point is only supposed to loose tea

1827
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:24,560
right now and if we want to support like

1828
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:28,360
Street te then new seats new uses are

1829
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:33,320
knitted right and the second point is I

1830
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:37,460
saw the profits is changed from 16 to 32

1831
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:41,360
pitch does that mean people cannot

1832
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:44,510
afford the 16 bits professors it will

1833
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:48,830
burn all the artists in that block right

1834
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:50,750
since the the address shifting and and

1835
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:54,019
the last one is

1836
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:56,290
I don't think the 80 beats argument in

1837
01:27:54,020 --> 01:28:00,230
da is correct

1838
01:27:56,290 --> 01:28:04,220
yeah yeah maybe you should use an arrow

1839
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:06,799
name it is no argument and finally I

1840
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:09,350
don't think it's supposed to reduce mode

1841
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:12,830
because when you use the reduce mode and

1842
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:16,940
the post information will be lost and by

1843
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:21,380
the way we have post draft to define a

1844
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:24,530
new solution yep do you expect I answer

1845
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:26,110
all your points or we can just okay it's

1846
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:30,469
okay okay

1847
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:33,500
no if we can take it offline and it's

1848
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:44,420
better to fill it up like the times

1849
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:49,220
limit Thanks no stiffens hi Andrew here

1850
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:50,450
from I wanted to just say you know I was

1851
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:55,100
listening to what you were saying about

1852
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:59,030
it just being another SIL type it's not

1853
01:28:55,100 --> 01:29:02,060
and here's why if this is just another

1854
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:04,820
sip time I'm not having to distribute it

1855
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:08,150
in my IGP if we know that I want to

1856
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:12,590
steer through in a way that is going to

1857
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:14,330
end up in my standard v6 foot which when

1858
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:17,890
you're running low from devices on the

1859
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:22,420
edge you are going to dramatically

1860
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:25,070
dramatically increase the size of my AGP

1861
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:28,100
which could have consequences serious

1862
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:29,330
cost consequences on on the ITP when

1863
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:32,510
you're adding more and more and more

1864
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:35,840
because these are v6 addresses from that

1865
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:36,590
perspective and we spoke I was listening

1866
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,710
earlier when they're talking about

1867
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:42,380
legacy hardware and support this because

1868
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:44,390
it's nice for legacy hardware because it

1869
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:46,610
doesn't have to do label processing but

1870
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:52,370
look at the counter-argument to this the

1871
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:55,339
legacy hardware is slowly ferb small

1872
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:57,650
devices and the very thing where you're

1873
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:59,180
helping on the one you're shooting it in

1874
01:29:57,650 --> 01:30:02,480
the foot on the other because of the

1875
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:03,019
increase in the third size and that to

1876
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,558
me

1877
01:30:03,019 --> 01:30:09,709
is a really really major concern I saw

1878
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:11,469
from the address space you've got issues

1879
01:30:09,709 --> 01:30:14,779
with the address space but that

1880
01:30:11,469 --> 01:30:17,899
inflation of the IGP that this will

1881
01:30:14,779 --> 01:30:19,279
cause from the way I read it is is a

1882
01:30:17,899 --> 01:30:19,969
massive problem and it's not just

1883
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:21,529
another set

1884
01:30:19,969 --> 01:30:23,479
that's an address because it's being

1885
01:30:21,529 --> 01:30:26,149
propagated straight in from my normal v6

1886
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:28,129
third there's a couple point in what you

1887
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:29,839
mentioned the IGP scale

1888
01:30:28,129 --> 01:30:30,979
I think there's I think it's not correct

1889
01:30:29,839 --> 01:30:32,989
I think there's techniques to address

1890
01:30:30,979 --> 01:30:35,929
that and the second point that you

1891
01:30:32,989 --> 01:30:39,049
mentioned is small legacy things I think

1892
01:30:35,929 --> 01:30:41,599
we should probably step go I find to

1893
01:30:39,049 --> 01:30:42,979
really go in deeper what you mean I'd be

1894
01:30:41,599 --> 01:30:45,019
pleasure to do so after this workshop

1895
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:48,019
yes so if I can just add one other thing

1896
01:30:45,019 --> 01:30:52,789
that I forgot as I was walking away yeah

1897
01:30:48,019 --> 01:30:56,899
ingress in order to reduce first

1898
01:30:52,789 --> 01:30:59,329
normally we use a lot of l1 l2 areas in

1899
01:30:56,899 --> 01:31:03,889
a v4 world we can stitch you know

1900
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:06,318
labeled unit cost yes or MPLS etc can

1901
01:31:03,889 --> 01:31:09,079
you explain to me with this because I

1902
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:12,579
couldn't get it I really try how I'm

1903
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:15,679
going to do that kind of l1 l2 stitching

1904
01:31:12,579 --> 01:31:19,879
while preserving the ability to sphere

1905
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:21,619
across both without flooding my l2 area

1906
01:31:19,879 --> 01:31:23,419
because I couldn't understand how to do

1907
01:31:21,619 --> 01:31:25,339
that I really looked and I couldn't

1908
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:27,679
grasp it in the context of this maybe

1909
01:31:25,339 --> 01:31:29,179
I'm missing something I said we'll we'll

1910
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,909
take it offline because I think we're

1911
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:33,319
gonna stand here all the way for 412 but

1912
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:37,279
yes there's techniques for that I'll be

1913
01:31:33,319 --> 01:31:42,979
a pleasure to discuss one good point

1914
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:45,649
sorry that Iran as common as the Cisco

1915
01:31:42,979 --> 01:31:49,609
Systems Dan said their techniques you

1916
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:51,349
not do not necessarily you know impact

1917
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:53,119
your GP scale there are techniques where

1918
01:31:51,349 --> 01:31:54,889
you can advertise one prefix that covers

1919
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:55,759
both and by the way will you're saying

1920
01:31:54,889 --> 01:31:58,909
we are go time is it

1921
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,919
we are not advising sit in it is locator

1922
01:31:58,909 --> 01:32:05,539
which is the ipv6 prefix what we can

1923
01:32:00,919 --> 01:32:07,760
continue more on offline Stephanie from

1924
01:32:05,539 --> 01:32:11,389
Orange so question is not for you how

1925
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,399
the chance because I I don't have any

1926
01:32:11,389 --> 01:32:16,570
opinion what would be the good solution

1927
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:18,489
okay so I completely agree

1928
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:20,949
if you approach that we need a kind of

1929
01:32:18,489 --> 01:32:23,888
Purim statement what kind of current do

1930
01:32:20,949 --> 01:32:26,348
we need to have to solve today but what

1931
01:32:23,889 --> 01:32:28,869
kind of information are we really

1932
01:32:26,349 --> 01:32:31,780
looking for to know what is a problem I

1933
01:32:28,869 --> 01:32:35,530
think what we need is what are the other

1934
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:38,110
limitations today and what even if it's

1935
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:41,739
not really a limitation what is the

1936
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:45,190
extra cost and the basic production to

1937
01:32:41,739 --> 01:32:48,790
get a CH working properly all the use

1938
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:50,860
cases that we need at line rate and do

1939
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:56,110
you really expect the vendor to disclose

1940
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:58,598
this because for SMPS we have never been

1941
01:32:56,110 --> 01:33:00,219
able to get this information while today

1942
01:32:58,599 --> 01:33:03,400
we still have some other issues with

1943
01:33:00,219 --> 01:33:06,010
existing platforms that's a good

1944
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:08,980
question it's clear that if everyone

1945
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:12,570
says that they can do everything that's

1946
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:14,379
not true yes but if they do say that

1947
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:17,730
there is no problem

1948
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:20,920
tom of hardware and we can network

1949
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:23,409
solution right limiting the internal

1950
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:25,810
hardware yeah but I'm already worried

1951
01:33:23,409 --> 01:33:27,339
that we will never be able to know that

1952
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:30,250
there is a problem to solve

1953
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:34,980
so do you have a suggestion and

1954
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:38,230
fortunately we can we can just get

1955
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:40,269
information today that a7p we are not

1956
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:43,388
able to do everything that we want today

1957
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:45,849
with existing platform with SM MPLS so

1958
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:49,929
we can foresee that with SH with it

1959
01:33:45,849 --> 01:33:51,940
which is using bigger lengths of seed we

1960
01:33:49,929 --> 01:33:55,210
will have bigger problems that's what's

1961
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:57,098
wrong but yeah such just a statement we

1962
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:59,079
are not sure because we are not able to

1963
01:33:57,099 --> 01:34:01,989
get the right information so the issue

1964
01:33:59,079 --> 01:34:05,170
is a Jewish issues with 10% of

1965
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:07,388
deployments or 90% of deployments on

1966
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:09,880
same thing we have issue with 10% of

1967
01:34:07,389 --> 01:34:12,429
hardware or 90% of hardware we have to

1968
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:18,159
know some kind of information because we

1969
01:34:12,429 --> 01:34:19,810
got accept 20 solutions what you're

1970
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:26,348
trying to do do you want to do work kind

1971
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:26,990
of animal survey to the vendors and

1972
01:34:26,349 --> 01:34:28,460
operator

1973
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:30,200
it's a good point right but it's the

1974
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,630
same discussion we said we had about

1975
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:35,030
like oh how long does this in stack look

1976
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:36,680
in MSRP less at the start right like I

1977
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:38,120
think when I was I was at an operator

1978
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:40,430
that was looking at Jason cease its

1979
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:42,349
pecking and we had debates about this I

1980
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:44,690
think we have to rely on the working

1981
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:47,030
group to bring Anik data if it's not

1982
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:50,360
definitive data right like this this is

1983
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:53,360
the you know some some indicative data

1984
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:54,650
about what the constraints are and we

1985
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,839
know it's not going to be perfect but

1986
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:59,540
the problem is if we say okay there's no

1987
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:02,180
no data at all then like at what point

1988
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:04,310
do we do have a problem like mmm one

1989
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:06,110
solution could be say well make it look

1990
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:07,670
as much I guess our MPLS as possible

1991
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:08,210
because we know what the constraints are

1992
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:10,580
MPLS ah

1993
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:11,990
and there's these folks deploying it we

1994
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:14,240
probably want a bit more of a guidance

1995
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:15,950
than that to be able to figure out what

1996
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,690
the right things but the point is

1997
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:19,580
completely about it and that's the

1998
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:21,019
challenge we have here right it's very

1999
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:22,670
easy to stand up and say hey this thing

2000
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:27,560
isn't optimal but how important is it

2001
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:29,660
not be not sure comment on the previous

2002
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:33,320
question so they're tourists if that

2003
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:35,150
define MSB and it clearly state heavier

2004
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:37,009
when they're communicating to machine to

2005
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:38,900
machine interface what your platform

2006
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:41,420
supports that could be advertised in a

2007
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:43,580
GPS and P set bgp so your PC can

2008
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:45,770
actually compute path properly if you're

2009
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:48,640
a customer operator demand here when

2010
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:48,640
they're takes process limitations

2011
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:56,090
I think proposing to advertise in MSD so

2012
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:59,300
ability for each footer to be able to

2013
01:35:56,090 --> 01:36:00,950
push many accuracy exceeded so

2014
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:03,020
apparently there is a willing to

2015
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:05,389
advertise that such out where value in

2016
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:07,910
the a GB in which case it will be

2017
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:11,390
prediction in which case we can send it

2018
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:12,410
to the Imperius around MPs or as a

2019
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:15,530
springbok know

2020
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:19,760
Ron Monica Juniper Networks one of the

2021
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:22,849
advantages of ipv6 paste segment routing

2022
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:25,820
over MPLS based as you retain retain a

2023
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:27,580
trace of where the packet has been you

2024
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:32,840
don't pop every label off along the way

2025
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:34,519
and micro said is there a way to retain

2026
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:36,710
a trace of where the packet is

2027
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:40,520
and what is the cost of that in terms of

2028
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:42,020
encapsulation size yes in the network

2029
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:46,310
programming draft I think there's a

2030
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:47,780
section for that 13 that describes like

2031
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:49,430
if you want to do like a trace char or

2032
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:52,309
something like that when you have or

2033
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:53,870
what is the cost of that well a common

2034
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:57,310
is a Cisco system if you don't do the

2035
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:59,450
reduced version then Dennison SRH

2036
01:36:57,310 --> 01:37:02,300
although you can have a shifted forward

2037
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:05,630
and updated destination but asserted you

2038
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:08,240
still have the actual destination okay

2039
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:12,080
so it's 128 bytes then the next question

2040
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:15,260
is in the draft and the example in the

2041
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:18,590
draft the only thing that the SRH

2042
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:21,020
carries is an NB t for that is to be

2043
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:23,780
that has nothing to do with routing it's

2044
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:25,310
actually a destination option why is

2045
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:27,320
that in a routing header given that

2046
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:30,770
there's no routing to be done by that

2047
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:33,620
routing header it's a good question

2048
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:35,630
maybe you can write it in the in the

2049
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:55,730
mailing yes I know I'll take care to

2050
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:58,010
reply to it okay Carter darling then

2051
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:59,780
speaking as an operator I think this is

2052
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:01,250
a step in the right direction especially

2053
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:04,490
all the simplifications which comes with

2054
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:08,180
SRH even though and also this handles

2055
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:11,599
the MTU efficiency which is what Dan was

2056
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:13,790
also referring to is the for the legacy

2057
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:18,770
hardware so I think this is applicable

2058
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:21,380
at least in our scenario sorry we

2059
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:24,950
couldn't hear you if you can send your

2060
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:27,980
question on jabber maybe genuine cover

2061
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:32,120
just like dimensions as comments we we

2062
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:35,000
made regarding the network programming

2063
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:37,490
draft actual applies here I am glad to

2064
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,830
see that you la usage I was removed from

2065
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:42,349
the draft but I still think we need to

2066
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:44,150
clarify on the draft Awards address

2067
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:46,310
space you need what the size of it and

2068
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:48,230
because currently it's unclear you said

2069
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:51,380
any address space

2070
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:55,129
- I see so it could be 32 / 48 can it be

2071
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:57,140
/ 64 like so I think more analysis meet

2072
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:58,850
on address space and where is it

2073
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:01,100
addressed voices coming from probably a

2074
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:03,680
as long as I mentioned in my request

2075
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:05,630
special block from Ayana which is not

2076
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:08,600
publicly routable and could be used by a

2077
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:11,210
network - in basically concern about

2078
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:13,550
using too much of address space without

2079
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:16,520
proper justification so we'll clarify

2080
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:18,560
that in upcoming versions but the short

2081
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:20,690
answer is yes it does apply to a many

2082
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,130
type of prefixes so obviously the

2083
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:29,750
shorter it is the less you said you're

2084
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:32,060
gonna have but put clarify that so my

2085
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:34,280
question is with respect to the end or

2086
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:37,850
TT force if that appears in an example

2087
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:41,120
in a seperate SRH in the draft so this

2088
01:39:37,850 --> 01:39:43,070
also comes out of the locator space so

2089
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:47,269
can it also be a micro search so it

2090
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:51,969
appears as part of micro site rather

2091
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:51,970
than a separate are saved in the SRH

2092
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:59,620
did you get that yeah that would be

2093
01:39:57,020 --> 01:40:02,810
future work in the draft

2094
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:02,809
[Music]

2095
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:10,340
in fact I insisted as the if we want to

2096
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:13,310
solve this circle usually so the concern

2097
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:15,440
I think that's oh we need to press I

2098
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:17,780
think that that's for the US Army are so

2099
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:20,379
they are already you the Pythian see the

2100
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:22,639
solution I think this is amateur I

2101
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:25,280
singly so first of all the second why

2102
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:27,320
human you the SRX sure this compression

2103
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:29,900
we proposed the word draft that's the

2104
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:32,630
user can compatible with the SR action

2105
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:35,660
without user control click extension I

2106
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:40,600
hope that you can refer to this one okay

2107
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:42,040
thanks thanks it

2108
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,560
visca so i just want to make a comment

2109
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:46,570
on only andrew's comment about the HIV

2110
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:48,250
exploitation with a microchip there's

2111
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:49,599
none there is no difference in

2112
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:51,970
advertising the mic receipt and a

2113
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,380
regular see if you have any concern i

2114
01:40:51,970 --> 01:41:00,730
would like to know we can take it

2115
01:40:53,380 --> 01:41:04,060
offline and talk of the meeting I'm

2116
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:06,730
Monica juniper a minute ago we said that

2117
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:08,860
we could put the NDT 4 in the ipv6

2118
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:11,110
address along and the microstate along

2119
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:17,559
with all the other SIDS if that's the

2120
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:19,929
case what do we need an S RH for outside

2121
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:23,080
the scope of this lecture maybe I can

2122
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:26,800
that brings a another question that is

2123
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:28,840
probably for the AE given the

2124
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,900
conversation we've had around the

2125
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:35,650
interaction between micro seeds and the

2126
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:37,570
network programming draft and CHS

2127
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:39,099
actually gonna sorry run if I can answer

2128
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:40,929
your first question like we already said

2129
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:43,240
that you can put multiple microstates at

2130
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:46,180
NS our header ok if you need to be

2131
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:47,860
frozen yeah yeah add more ok you want to

2132
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,290
be only actually do you want to maintain

2133
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:53,320
the state put in yes our header yes our

2134
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:55,300
header draft and definition is still

2135
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:57,730
exists and this is compatible with it so

2136
01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:03,430
don't for use in cases where you're bent

2137
01:41:57,730 --> 01:42:05,320
your you need fewer than 7 SIDS you

2138
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:06,880
wouldn't need any college right now LDS

2139
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:10,630
our header graph says that nests our

2140
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:12,760
source node may or may not add an SR

2141
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:14,470
header and that's already in the draft

2142
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,940
and that's something that we've well

2143
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:17,920
with it's been in there for a very long

2144
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:21,519
time it it applies to this microstate at

2145
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:23,920
a place every sit so there's no I don't

2146
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:26,890
I don't think there's any discussion to

2147
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:29,410
be out there but we could take it in the

2148
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:33,340
milling lists formally providing them

2149
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:36,519
and then the rest of my comment is

2150
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:39,250
probably addressed to alvaro given that

2151
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:43,260
we've discovered these new interactions

2152
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:47,590
between micro said and other SIDS and

2153
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:50,680
other things it kind of makes me wonder

2154
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:53,140
how far the network programming draft is

2155
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:54,570
from being mature

2156
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:59,130
maybe a working group

2157
01:42:54,570 --> 01:43:02,099
but far from mature so so far micro

2158
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:05,040
Celia has not been inducted so it's zero

2159
01:43:02,099 --> 01:43:07,739
the one presentation so so far there is

2160
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:10,050
no interaction with working document you

2161
01:43:07,739 --> 01:43:15,329
willing if if you willing to contribute

2162
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:19,050
in the micro said you can discuss we

2163
01:43:15,329 --> 01:43:21,949
care anything else now let's move on to

2164
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:21,949
the next presentation

2165
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:27,199
[Music]

2166
01:43:55,159 --> 01:44:01,049
my name is Chad I'm gonna talk about

2167
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:03,449
detailed procedures draft on behalf of

2168
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:05,460
my co-authors so since the last

2169
01:44:03,449 --> 01:44:10,469
presentation we have new co-authors

2170
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:12,090
contributing to the draft a short

2171
01:44:10,469 --> 01:44:16,590
background on what this draft is all

2172
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:19,349
about so the mpls tres loud procedures

2173
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:22,349
uses TTL expiring mechanisms to visit

2174
01:44:19,349 --> 01:44:25,170
every node so it needs some kind of a

2175
01:44:22,349 --> 01:44:29,579
special handling for PHP cases and this

2176
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:33,570
this draft is talking about the solution

2177
01:44:29,579 --> 01:44:38,790
for penalty might hop nodes for trace

2178
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:42,030
route so in this version there is an

2179
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:44,820
update on how the TTL procedures need to

2180
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:46,559
be handled for binding sites and the

2181
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:49,799
next few slides talk about how it is

2182
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:51,570
done for bindings it so in short there

2183
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,630
is no big difference from how it is

2184
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:58,530
being done today for other hierarchical

2185
01:44:54,630 --> 01:45:01,469
LSP cases from a 0 to 9 so it's just a

2186
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:04,230
clarification for binding how it can be

2187
01:45:01,469 --> 01:45:06,900
done for binding sites because from last

2188
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:07,919
presentation we had questions you know

2189
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:12,540
that how

2190
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:17,429
this is done for mine exits so we see

2191
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:20,690
here a set of routers R 1 2 R 6 and

2192
01:45:17,429 --> 01:45:23,130
there's a path set up using two labels

2193
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:25,379
one thousand and six and eight thousand

2194
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:27,840
one eight thousand one is a binding set

2195
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:32,250
that expands in two thousand four

2196
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:34,650
thousand five so that that's the SR path

2197
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:37,860
that's being built so if you have to do

2198
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:39,449
a traceroute procedure for this so there

2199
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:41,699
are two different modes in which this

2200
01:45:39,449 --> 01:45:44,400
can be done a uniform mode and a short

2201
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:47,280
pipe more uniform mode would visit the

2202
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:49,710
nodes in which is concealed by this

2203
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:54,420
binding set and the short pipe mode

2204
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:56,520
would would take a hop from the from the

2205
01:45:54,420 --> 01:46:00,510
the node that advertised binding set and

2206
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:06,380
would not reveal the nodes that are that

2207
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:06,380
are represented by that binding site so

2208
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:15,330
so in in the step one if we see here we

2209
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:17,969
the r1 would send to sits that is one

2210
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:19,949
zero zero six and eight zero zero one so

2211
01:46:17,969 --> 01:46:23,370
that would go with the top one go would

2212
01:46:19,949 --> 01:46:26,910
go with the TTL of one and then our two

2213
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:30,840
would it would visit our two and then it

2214
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:34,800
would look at the eight zero zero one

2215
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:37,679
and inform of extract change as defined

2216
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:40,440
in RFC a zero to nine and then the feck

2217
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:43,890
step change would would have those two

2218
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:45,960
facts 4 1 0 0 4 and 1 0 0 5 in uniform

2219
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:48,150
mode so the next step our one would

2220
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:52,980
increment the TTL and send it to our two

2221
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:55,170
so the TTL would on our to the if you

2222
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:58,980
look at step two it comes in with 2 and

2223
01:46:55,170 --> 01:47:01,199
then it get TTL on it it it doesn't one

2224
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:03,209
gets decremented to one which gets

2225
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:05,160
copied onto the new label stack that I

2226
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:10,590
got pushed which is a thousand four and

2227
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:14,190
thousand five and the validation for

2228
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:17,310
thousand four would happen on r3 and r4

2229
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:21,000
which is very similar to what's already

2230
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:23,640
been discussed there's no no change and

2231
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,830
every the packet visits every node the

2232
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:28,110
TTL on if you see bindings it keeps

2233
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:29,760
increasing which gets copied on to both

2234
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:34,440
the labels that got pushed because of

2235
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:36,660
the vinyl set and that's step three the

2236
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:40,620
thousand four get popped and that gets

2237
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:43,860
the the TTL gets copied on two thousand

2238
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:48,210
five and when thousand five gets popped

2239
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:50,660
in the step four it says it's it's a PHP

2240
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:54,690
and then sew the bottom label on r1 gets

2241
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:57,090
incremented to incremented with one so

2242
01:47:54,690 --> 01:48:01,200
you receive a packet on file with a

2243
01:47:57,090 --> 01:48:03,870
thousand six with the TTL of one and

2244
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:06,389
then the the facetious continues for a

2245
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:08,790
short pipe mode you don't really want to

2246
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:11,870
reveal the network which is concealed by

2247
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:14,850
this binding set so you don't copy the

2248
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:18,570
bindings it's TTL on to the other labels

2249
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:22,770
so you continue with the TTL of 255 so

2250
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:25,679
you the traceroute would not visit r3 r4

2251
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:30,090
and r5 and the packet arrives at our

2252
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:34,220
five and then it directly looks at a

2253
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:40,470
thousand six and then that's how the

2254
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:42,540
traceroute will continue so this is an

2255
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:45,330
MPLS working group so we will send a

2256
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:50,820
request to MPLS working group to adopt

2257
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:53,250
this document questions in comments the

2258
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:54,750
form Cisco Systems I have just one

2259
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:57,660
comment is nothing new right this is

2260
01:48:54,750 --> 01:49:03,990
known this is how it is do we need to

2261
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:06,059
document this so basically the it seems

2262
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:11,219
like the this is how it is to be done is

2263
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:13,640
not very clear in in from the existing

2264
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:17,220
documents and that's the comment we got

2265
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:18,870
that you know it needs clarifications so

2266
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:21,990
that's what is being so there are two

2267
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:24,120
things the PHP stuff that that needs to

2268
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:27,780
change and that is this clarification

2269
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:30,720
which is nothing new but an explanation

2270
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:32,769
of how it is to be done yeah they just

2271
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:35,510
want to find out

2272
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:38,389
you receive coming from customers that

2273
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:40,040
need clarification yes yes so actually

2274
01:49:38,389 --> 01:49:44,110
this was a comment from last times

2275
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:47,449
presentation that's why the so basically

2276
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:49,730
this document mostly should address the

2277
01:49:47,449 --> 01:49:56,089
TTL procedures things that are not clear

2278
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:58,400
from the existing documents Berger I

2279
01:49:56,090 --> 01:50:00,829
guess this might be a comment more for

2280
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,719
the MPLS working group since that's

2281
01:50:00,829 --> 01:50:04,250
where the document is something that

2282
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:06,110
would be really worthwhile to clarify

2283
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:08,480
and maybe it's a little too big a scope

2284
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:11,259
for this document but it'd be good if

2285
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:13,610
there was clarification on what srte is

2286
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:16,250
you reference a document that doesn't

2287
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:19,219
mention te at all as the defining

2288
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:20,480
document of srte I think working that

2289
01:50:19,219 --> 01:50:22,699
may impose working group would be great

2290
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:25,909
but we need a definition of it if we're

2291
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:28,159
gonna use that term yeah I mean actually

2292
01:50:25,909 --> 01:50:30,049
to the chairs you did reference an srte

2293
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:31,098
policy document and I looked and there's

2294
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:33,230
no SR te

2295
01:50:31,099 --> 01:50:35,869
there's no te mentioned in that document

2296
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:38,209
as well I don't mind using the term but

2297
01:50:35,869 --> 01:50:40,089
let's define it and I think if you want

2298
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:42,889
to do it and then tell us it's awesome

2299
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:58,699
yeah sure yeah it's just they didn't do

2300
01:50:42,889 --> 01:51:03,849
one pls te next is the farm

2301
01:50:58,699 --> 01:51:03,848
I believe so in Siena

2302
01:51:05,449 --> 01:51:12,049
it's going to be clear that we are not

2303
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:14,690
going to two to zero or agenda we had a

2304
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:16,489
long discussion on that program in Ian

2305
01:51:14,690 --> 01:51:18,500
which is an important complement so I

2306
01:51:16,489 --> 01:51:20,089
think it was important but a long

2307
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:22,849
discussion and do we need to do

2308
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:26,840
something to reduce the side of the size

2309
01:51:22,849 --> 01:51:30,380
of yessuh basics cedar which I think was

2310
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:35,800
important or so but so we have to

2311
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:38,300
apologize to the fara rakish of Zeebo

2312
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:42,760
apparently we there's no way we'd be

2313
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:44,440
able to to prison many many things sorry

2314
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:48,340
great

2315
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:50,379
Thanks so this is the SR v6 onm job that

2316
01:51:48,340 --> 01:52:01,080
I'm presenting on behalf of my

2317
01:51:50,380 --> 01:52:03,990
co-authors this is next next yeah so

2318
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:07,690
basically the work this work is started

2319
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:11,260
two years back this has been reviewed

2320
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:13,870
and presented to six men and spring

2321
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:15,550
working group multiple times there has

2322
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:17,530
been revision and comments on the

2323
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:20,470
mailing list and all these comments have

2324
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:22,330
been addressed there was some offline

2325
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:25,060
discussion as well a meaning of frank

2326
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:27,330
discussion alcohol on the draft so from

2327
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:31,450
that is draft has been very stable

2328
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:35,110
there are deployments they are there is

2329
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:38,500
a draft that describe all the

2330
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:40,980
deployments is a public information the

2331
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:43,870
deployment of Softbank channel telecom

2332
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:45,669
they deploy a lead network and their

2333
01:52:43,870 --> 01:52:49,710
additional deployment in preparation and

2334
01:52:45,670 --> 01:52:52,360
this draft is part of the deployment

2335
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:54,600
from implementation side we have at

2336
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:56,620
least 10 platform shipping this

2337
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,830
information there are other known

2338
01:52:56,620 --> 01:53:01,840
implementations and public information

2339
01:52:58,830 --> 01:53:05,710
information is publicly available at the

2340
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:11,980
draft mentioned here and there was

2341
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:15,420
interoperability done at EA NTC back in

2342
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:19,509
march and then it was showcased in a pro

2343
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:21,850
at MPLS for congress we we have also

2344
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:25,630
done some additional private

2345
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:29,400
interoperability among multiple vendors

2346
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:31,870
and some of the details are in that

2347
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:36,879
draft that I mentioned for deployment

2348
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:38,880
status for draft summary and it

2349
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:43,120
basically defines

2350
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:45,820
öbut slacks already are defined in SRH

2351
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:48,940
so it defines one of the flags as the

2352
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:53,860
öbut is defined the usage that flag and

2353
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:55,190
it defines to onm sets and dot o P which

2354
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:57,679
is for

2355
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:59,839
you receive a packet and then you have

2356
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:02,060
enduro peace if you want it and when the

2357
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:06,710
Oh end or OTP which is you receive a

2358
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:10,190
packet this time is Tamron punted it

2359
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:14,230
then defined usage of this these toolkit

2360
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:17,089
for ping and traceroute and it also

2361
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:20,839
extends the path monitoring which is in

2362
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:25,070
RFC 8284 or three for a servicing

2363
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:28,460
network the main point that I want to

2364
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:32,929
discuss here is that where the chairs

2365
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:34,910
would like to proceed this draft we can

2366
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:38,180
take to position one position is that

2367
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:41,120
the flags are already fine in Salvi six

2368
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:46,150
network programming so other working

2369
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:49,690
group can define a flag in its usage and

2370
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:54,889
so spring can define that for example

2371
01:54:49,690 --> 01:54:57,230
and or with obviously review done at six

2372
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:59,990
men all the expert reviews done a six

2373
01:54:57,230 --> 01:55:03,889
then the other option would be that this

2374
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:06,980
draft actually get proceeded at six men

2375
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:09,050
but at the moment at this idea if you

2376
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:11,690
would really like the working of

2377
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:13,850
adoption we don't have any preference

2378
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:16,519
whether it happens here in six men or it

2379
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:19,400
happens here in spring or it happens six

2380
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:21,440
men but there has been multiple

2381
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:23,719
implementation and deployment if this

2382
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:25,519
graph is been there for long and I

2383
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:27,980
presented multiple times if India for

2384
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:34,420
two years actively discussed so it's

2385
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:37,400
time for the adoption for this draft so

2386
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:39,350
waiting for this work to finish from

2387
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:42,469
from be stable so it's now it's moving

2388
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:45,070
to is G regarding whether it's to be

2389
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:49,820
turning spring on six manner we don't

2390
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:51,980
have an opinion by by default it's it's

2391
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:55,150
like basically a extension so six man

2392
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:58,490
has priority okay but so we discuss with

2393
01:55:55,150 --> 01:56:01,009
six men trails and destroying I don't

2394
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:03,800
have any approvals yeah so we will this

2395
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:06,590
is on a gender for six men so I asked

2396
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:07,369
that option is six men and you for this

2397
01:56:06,590 --> 01:56:09,320
stuff

2398
01:56:07,369 --> 01:56:11,809
yes you can also take it it's expanded

2399
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:20,619
say that excellent thank you

2400
01:56:11,810 --> 01:56:20,619
any questions comments okay thank you I

2401
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:41,900
think given that we only have four

2402
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:43,849
minutes we want to try and ask somebody

2403
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:48,730
to squeeze their presentation and that

2404
01:56:43,849 --> 01:56:51,619
was ten before so nothing else then I

2405
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:54,440
would propose this is closes string for

2406
01:56:51,619 --> 01:56:56,210
this meeting Oh

2407
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:57,530
ragosa's that he can cover in four

2408
01:56:56,210 --> 01:57:02,900
minutes there we go

2409
01:56:57,530 --> 01:57:11,750
okay so it's left four minutes to go we

2410
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:13,280
have a short presentation on Frank good

2411
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:16,820
morning everyone my name is Lucas

2412
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:19,550
Kennedy and I'm presenting the IOA m4s

2413
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:23,210
our MPLS data plane on behalf of the

2414
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:25,190
authors and contributors listed so

2415
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:28,849
requirements and scope procedures and

2416
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:31,309
next steps so basically this is carrying

2417
01:57:28,849 --> 01:57:35,210
the iom data fields with the sorry MPLS

2418
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:37,369
and capitalistic encapsulation what that

2419
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:40,219
means is their way i am information

2420
01:57:37,369 --> 01:57:43,250
carried by the data traffic so we are

2421
01:57:40,219 --> 01:57:47,330
using the data fields defined in the i

2422
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:49,099
ppm working group document so far we'll

2423
01:57:47,330 --> 01:57:54,800
be looking at the end to end io am and

2424
01:57:49,099 --> 01:57:58,159
we will add hop-by-hop iom in future so

2425
01:57:54,800 --> 01:58:00,349
the end capsaicin has indicator label as

2426
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:05,888
well as the data fields defined in the i

2427
01:58:00,349 --> 01:58:08,780
ppm working AB document so basically

2428
01:58:05,889 --> 01:58:11,510
encapsulation node inserts the indicator

2429
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:15,980
label as well as the IOM data field in

2430
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:18,920
the header and d-cap node forwards the

2431
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:21,200
packet but takes a timestamp copy of it

2432
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:24,020
for IOM

2433
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:27,530
and it also removes the indicator label

2434
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:30,520
as well as the data field so there are

2435
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:33,500
three methods that's possible for the

2436
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:36,680
indicator label allocation the first one

2437
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:38,780
is the ini allocation there can be a

2438
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:42,980
global label that's allocated by a

2439
01:58:38,780 --> 01:58:45,019
controller or a signaling mechanism so

2440
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:48,490
we can take the feedback from the

2441
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:51,200
working group on which matter to go with

2442
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:52,219
there is some implication on hashing as

2443
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:54,400
well

2444
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:59,240
the couple of them listed here

2445
01:58:54,400 --> 01:59:03,740
definitely if the indicator label has

2446
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:07,160
the end of stack get set then the zero

2447
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:09,260
four zero six type II protocol there the

2448
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:12,680
IP hissing looks for that so that may

2449
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:15,230
not work as well as if the hashing is

2450
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:18,920
using the labels then now it may include

2451
01:59:15,230 --> 01:59:21,799
the indicator label as well so next

2452
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:25,010
steps we will add some more details on

2453
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:28,340
the ecmp hashing we can also include the

2454
01:59:25,010 --> 01:59:30,860
hop-by-hop iom if there is interest for

2455
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:32,870
that work we welcome your comments and

2456
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:35,960
suggestions and we are seeking for

2457
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:38,059
working up adoption thank you

2458
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:41,200
one question have you present it to MPs

2459
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:45,670
working group have you present either

2460
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:48,889
yeah I presented this on Monday okay

2461
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:51,170
approve it it's a bit easy on the MPs

2462
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:52,820
extension so probably should be in a

2463
01:59:51,170 --> 01:59:56,360
police work group we can discuss with

2464
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:58,400
yes sir yes the feedback was that if

2465
01:59:56,360 --> 02:00:00,469
you're going with the matter one which

2466
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:03,469
requires the IANA a location for a

2467
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:06,500
special purpose label and that is in the

2468
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:09,950
MPLS working group solo I mentioned that

2469
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:11,720
this can go to MPLS or in so do you want

2470
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:14,900
to figure out which option you want to

2471
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:16,430
peak before or otherwise it might be

2472
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:19,969
food probably going to be any less

2473
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:22,010
 good yeah so I think we would

2474
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:24,770
prefer the matter one but if working

2475
02:00:22,010 --> 02:00:29,810
group has any feedback then we can look

2476
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:30,639
at the option towards which when come on

2477
02:00:29,810 --> 02:00:36,190
Jeff

2478
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:39,369
I believe it's covered for by some IP

2479
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:40,750
I'll contact Erickson to review this but

2480
02:00:39,369 --> 02:00:44,369
we have discussion before at the same

2481
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:46,989
button it will cover exactly this case

2482
02:00:44,369 --> 02:00:52,599
secretion all that there is some lawyers

2483
02:00:46,989 --> 02:00:54,909
do this okay thanks and I cry Snow

2484
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:58,630
White's we need this work because I

2485
02:00:54,909 --> 02:01:01,960
think IOM cost a lot and if you want to

2486
02:00:58,630 --> 02:01:05,650
do IOM in amperes and postcard based

2487
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:11,230
eternity would be better muster okay

2488
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:15,540
yeah we can talk our plane okay with

2489
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:15,540
them thank you

2490
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,829
