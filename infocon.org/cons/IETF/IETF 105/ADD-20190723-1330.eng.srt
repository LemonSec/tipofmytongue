1
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:17,169
alright it is 1:30 we're going to start

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:20,090
I'm Lars eager business tale Lawrence

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,670
we are your MCS for the session on

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,320
applications doing DNS various

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,170
responsibilities this is a non working

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,430
group forming off as far as I remember

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,020
we are super organized we already have

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,640
minute acres which are crisper than Paul

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,010
Hoffman thank you very much

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,620
they're doing minutes in the ether pad

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,420
which is the ether pad you would expect

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,269
for this buff if you want to help them

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,370
out when you you know in case you get

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,840
bored your ad names of people that you

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,970
know but they might not know the names

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,350
are for the minutes and so on make sure

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,420
we have a good record of all of this

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,160
Aaron Fork is Java scribing which is

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,800
mostly sort of relaying questions from

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,519
the jabber to the microphones um so if

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,339
Aaron gets into line we might give him

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,480
priority if and when he wants to channel

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,879
somebody who's been waiting a long time

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,179
in jabber land we have the possibility

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,439
to take remote questions um so we need

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,850
to look at this thing to figure out

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,708
whether somebody is getting into line

28
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,999
remotely if you notice us missing

29
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,450
somebody who's been up there for a long

30
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:18,469
time

31
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,139
signals this is our agenda it's pretty

32
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:23,689
packed Kayla's gonna do a little

33
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:28,520
background presentation and we have a

34
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:32,178
few very short presentations on various

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,740
possible items of work in the overall

36
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:35,599
space that the buff is supposed to talk

37
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,598
about and then we have a little bit of

38
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,969
an open mic session at the end that is

39
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:50,240
the plan would anybody like to bash this

40
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:52,669
agenda okay that worked um where is my

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,048
node well it's here this is the ITF node

42
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:56,479
well it's unfortunately a little bit

43
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,029
small but you should have seen this

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,459
already rules apply when you participate

45
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:07,609
here both in terms of disclosure in this

46
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:09,590
closing IPR and in a code of conduct if

47
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:11,840
you are unfamiliar with these you are

48
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:16,010
highly encouraged to refer to respective

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,150
RFC's and you're expected to comply with

50
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,370
the requirements stated therein

51
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,930
you do want to be aware of these rules

52
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,180
before you make a contribution and that

53
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,440
is speaking at this one for example or

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,310
sending an email right without further

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,310
ado tail

56
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:01,780
there we go it wasn't on before because

57
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,730
that light definitely wasn't on so even

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,130
though an awful lot of you in the room

59
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,940
are kind of familiar with how we got

60
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,769
here

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,549
we just want to do a really quick

62
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:15,549
background to remind people of it very

63
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:19,470
briefly the evolution of the DNS has

64
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,470
resulted in this in particular

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:33,730
okay so going way back to the 80s the

66
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,620
very typical way that we did the Ennis

67
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,959
on the internet was stop resolvers we

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,310
talked to local typically local

69
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,170
recursive resolvers

70
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,760
full-service caching resolvers that then

71
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,160
talk to the authorities name servers for

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,010
their data while it was always possible

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,870
to use a different model for getting

74
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,630
your DNS data this was the one that

75
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,019
almost all of our our clients were using

76
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,940
on the internet it was using plaintext

77
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:01,209
UDP packets for questions and answers

78
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,400
and one really interesting thing about

79
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:07,389
this is it made the DNS traffic

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,700
susceptible to being monitored and so

81
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,970
the Snowden revelations that happened

82
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:16,298
half a dozen years ago now led to the

83
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:20,918
IPS position paper essentially RFC 7258

84
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:23,109
the pervasive monitoring on the Internet

85
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,630
is should be considered an attack on the

86
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,610
infrastructure and so at that point

87
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,979
there were a couple of work products

88
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,750
that came out of the idea one was that

89
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,210
the deprived working group was formed to

90
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,950
try to address how we can improve the

91
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,090
privacy of our DNS traffic on the

92
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,130
Internet

93
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,039
one of their more notable work products

94
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,469
was encrypting DNS traffic with the DNS

95
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:48,700
over TLS protocol which essentially just

96
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:52,659
wrapped TLS around our standard DNS wire

97
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:58,030
format messages and then Along Came DNS

98
00:04:52,659 --> 00:05:01,150
over HTTPS which took basically DNS over

99
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:04,030
TLS one step further and not only

100
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,950
encrypted the traffic but then sent it

101
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,710
over the same port that all the other

102
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,539
HTTP traffic was going over to make DNS

103
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:17,950
traffic at that point indistinguishable

104
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:21,419
from normal HTTP traffic so RFC 84-84

105
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,430
was published nine months or so ago and

106
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:28,930
so this is using it should be primitives

107
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,690
to do this this query in response model

108
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,229
it really disrupted the traditional DNS

109
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,570
model on which a number of different

110
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,229
services have been built and now web

111
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,750
servers were really kind of thinking

112
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,940
pretending to be the role of could be

113
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,070
pretending the role of a traditional

114
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,630
resolving name server and so there has

115
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,690
been a lot of controversy and concerns

116
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,820
over that the employment models one is

117
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,010
that with a lot of policy now being

118
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,409
implemented in local DNS resolvers it

119
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,409
was really easy impossible to bypass

120
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:05,590
that and not just the policy but

121
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:08,919
actually even just a matter of things

122
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,960
that you might not consider policy for

123
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:12,849
example though just an internal view of

124
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,789
your name space versus an external view

125
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:19,270
of your name space some of these issues

126
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:22,630
that come up should presumably be in

127
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,280
scope for the idea others are kind of

128
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,870
really above all of our pay grade and

129
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,179
maybe need to be considered elsewhere

130
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,580
one of the issues a few of the issues

131
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,570
that were finding with doe now is

132
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:41,050
essentially this kind of long term

133
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,460
tension that our entire society has had

134
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,950
for millennia now since human beings

135
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,849
became intelligent which is where is

136
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,260
that the balance that you find between

137
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:52,530
things like safety and security and

138
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,669
privacy and convenience and ease of use

139
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,369
all of these things are in tension with

140
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:58,090
each other and dough is really

141
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,450
complicated

142
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,760
to increase privacy and security for

143
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:08,409
example but at the detriment perhaps of

144
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,810
some other aspects of security and so

145
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,310
there's a

146
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,740
question that goes on about filtering

147
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,540
can we filter you know is it being us a

148
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,520
good place to filter traffic you know

149
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,370
how if we're going to achieve the

150
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,889
privacy goal of dough of not being able

151
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,650
to let people's traffic and monitored

152
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:26,510
well that also enhances the ability of

153
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,710
people doing bad things and not yet

154
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:33,110
monitor and the network as a neutral

155
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,539
computer you just really can't tell the

156
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:40,639
difference between two easily between

157
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:43,280
what's good and what's evil and so in

158
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,860
this environment where traffic DNS

159
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,840
traffic is not being able to be

160
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,660
monitored or you know are we able to

161
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,599
somehow still find a good way of

162
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,830
addressing this it also should be noted

163
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,960
that a lot of the services that have

164
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,760
been built on the end also our intention

165
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,820
with the networks and then principle

166
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,740
that we've had where essentially the

167
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,740
middle of the network was supposed to be

168
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,740
relatively dumb compared to the edges

169
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,960
there were three internet draft

170
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:20,989
submitted originally and that we discuss

171
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:23,539
and I have 104 and these started looking

172
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,770
at a bunch of these issues it wasn't

173
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:27,919
entirely clear where to continue

174
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,380
pursuing these drafts as most of you

175
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,569
here know you know we can either pursue

176
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,979
dress through work product of working

177
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,539
groups or we can do them on the

178
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,339
independent submission track and they're

179
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,260
still a big question about what the

180
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:44,360
appropriate home to pursue this is and

181
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,720
if in fact the ITF is going to pursue it

182
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,970
or not there are a lot of interrelated

183
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,400
issues around deployment especially in

184
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,580
operator networks it's also worth noting

185
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,380
that there's a distinction between and

186
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,540
kind of some

187
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,370
operate the operational potential

188
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,199
operational models for some doe

189
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,970
deployments are kind of orthogonal to

190
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,570
just the existence of dough itself and

191
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:12,230
so there's a discussion that really has

192
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,630
to be ferreted out there we I've also

193
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,089
identified several other areas where

194
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:21,500
work might be interesting on this and

195
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,610
there's just no clear way to tell what

196
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,040
the best way

197
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,050
path forward for the ITF is among a

198
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,649
variety of options one of which is well

199
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,089
the ITF says this is difficult and

200
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,010
involves too much policy we're going to

201
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:36,649
wash our hands of it and not you know be

202
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,779
involved in further work which of course

203
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,670
doesn't mean that nothing happens it

204
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:44,480
only means the ITF isn't dealing with it

205
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:47,719
and then there is a possibility of

206
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,490
perhaps adopting this work into the more

207
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,200
closely aligned working groups with

208
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,140
whatever the particular nature is like

209
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,510
HTTP HTTP this might pick up a part of

210
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,640
it the NSF might pick up a part d5 might

211
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,990
pick up a part and then even though this

212
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,089
is not technically a working group

213
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,589
farming boss it is still kind of an open

214
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,690
question of perhaps we should be moving

215
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,480
in the direction of having a working

216
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,810
group specifically for working on these

217
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,670
issues and in fact this you'll notice

218
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,359
that the title of this particular baath

219
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:21,229
is for applications doing DMS not

220
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,810
applications going doe or the OTS you

221
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,290
know we're we're trying to identify how

222
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,149
can we look more closely at these issues

223
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,370
where the architecture of the Internet

224
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:34,279
could be possibly moving in the

225
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,760
direction where the traditional stuff to

226
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:40,750
local resolver to in remote

227
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,709
authoritative is being disrupted and

228
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:47,300
with doe is only one one possible method

229
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:52,939
of that happening but not by any means

230
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:54,349
the only one so the three drafts we were

231
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,570
talking about this is they're probably

232
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,649
out of scope for the current doe working

233
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,140
group which has not been shuttered

234
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,910
despite it was supposed to be this grand

235
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,990
experiment in the idea where we could

236
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,120
have a pop up working group get

237
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,220
something done and closed down the

238
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,870
working group it is still kind of

239
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,149
lingering on right now trying to find

240
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,850
you know like maybe the existing doe

241
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,680
group would be the area to handle a lot

242
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,760
of these things however if it were to do

243
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,050
that it would definitely need the

244
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,899
Charter change so recharging it as a

245
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,939
possibility but a lot of these other

246
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,699
issues don't really seem like they're

247
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,800
either doe specific or appropriate for

248
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:34,729
the where that doe working group

249
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,870
currently is we didn't have one when you

250
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,410
if you're standing by the door there's

251
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,000
some seats

252
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,560
or want files out of the room so just

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,120
make your way over and and if you have

254
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:47,530
an empty seat raise your hand so make it

255
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:49,580
easier for these guys to find a home so

256
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:53,689
those of you who are not aware there is

257
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,780
an existing mailing list is getting a

258
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,570
fair bit of active traffic in discussing

259
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,490
a lot of these issues sometimes heads

260
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,310
off a little bit into the weeds but you

261
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,340
know there's the idea that's what we do

262
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,349
where so we do have a home for

263
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:13,760
discussion right now but not a home for

264
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,260
the actual work and so this is why we're

265
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,800
all here to kind of decide what our next

266
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,340
steps is so we want to continue to

267
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,630
revisit whether the topics are still

268
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,110
relevant to work that we should be

269
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:29,300
pursuing you know should it doesn't make

270
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,360
sense for the idea to pursue it what can

271
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,420
we reasonably identify as our own work

272
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,830
effort and and if we are going to work

273
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,650
on it where should we do it and then

274
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,390
ultimately will your course be looking

275
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,189
for people to actually great documents

276
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,050
or contribute text documents and so on

277
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,000
and I think that's yes we're not doing

278
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,329
questions now because all these

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,980
discussions will come two minutes so if

280
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,110
you if people have any questions on the

281
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,050
scope of the ball that would be a quick

282
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:03,760
way to to ask them but you don't have to

283
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:03,760
if you don't want right okay no I think

284
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:15,100
spencer dawkins i was just going to say

285
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,160
you know on the question of deferring

286
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,930
layer nine issues to someplace else it

287
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,519
would be helpful to me and maybe to

288
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,410
other people if down the road not now

289
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,259
people could talk about whether there is

290
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,230
we're a place for these individual

291
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:34,420
issues to go exist i know we can't send

292
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,380
them there but if it's like we have to

293
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,729
spin up another operator community or

294
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,310
something like that i think that that

295
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,139
maybe changes the attractiveness of what

296
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,149
we talked about here maybe even the

297
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:48,690
scope of what we talk about here we

298
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:51,459
don't think that's reasonable yeah and

299
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,790
along those lines i would also mention

300
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:57,910
that while the ITF is typically eschewed

301
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,500
working on layer nine and you know

302
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,509
basically had the same you know if we

303
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,670
don't do policy it is worth noticing

304
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:06,610
that the technology decisions we make

305
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,569
are absolutely greasing policy in one

306
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,490
direction or another

307
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:14,260
so regardless of not wanting to do

308
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:16,180
policy we're still doing policy you'll

309
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,889
notice that we have tail mention that we

310
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,229
have a there's some work items that have

311
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:22,750
been presented and discussed earlier

312
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,339
there's a few more that we have today we

313
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,990
gave everybody a very short slot and

314
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,240
that slot actually includes a little bit

315
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,220
of time of Q&A for clarification

316
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,230
questions before the discussion at the

317
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,209
end that the point today is therefore

318
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,850
not to do like the technical deep dive

319
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,500
on any of those and and we're probably

320
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,209
gonna stop the discussion when that

321
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,029
starts to happen the point is to figure

322
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:46,229
out whether in the overall ad space that

323
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:49,360
tails just outline but whether there's a

324
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:52,000
need or an opportunity for the ITF to do

325
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,569
work and then see if some of the

326
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,069
proposed points in that space have

327
00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:00,149
consensus to be talked about more

328
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:03,610
technically somewhere else and hopefully

329
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,889
personally speaking at least for some of

330
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,329
them so if none of them we come to

331
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,360
agreement that we should do then we're

332
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:12,489
done in one way right but but i guess

333
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,089
the reason to have the buff is to see if

334
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,620
there's a few of those where they're

335
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:19,750
uncontroversial enough that some work

336
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,100
can be started some of them might need

337
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,750
more time but but the whole

338
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,700
personally some of them might actually

339
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,320
be able to go forward in some form

340
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,420
either new working groups or retarded is

341
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,220
this thing working groups or somehow

342
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,990
else but that's that's the the point of

343
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,520
the box we don't necessarily want to go

344
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,370
very deep on the technology we frankly

345
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,400
don't have the time for it so we're

346
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:49,150
gonna stop you if you start doing that

347
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:52,630
what shut up let's go the clicker or the

348
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:55,660
clicker in my hand you wanna get so I

349
00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:02,550
got my stuff for whatever it is okay I

350
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:06,329
can y'all make a flight if you on okay

351
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,329
right here we go

352
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,420
this I think is the relevant piece for

353
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,490
us we don't believe that privacy and

354
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,920
security are optional on the gobble

355
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:23,290
really so what have we been doing for

356
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,500
the past couple years is we've been

357
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,870
working on this thing called making HTTP

358
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,180
more accessible and easily deployed and

359
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:35,250
various other things that was a massive

360
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:37,750
project and it continues but we're

361
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,230
making pretty good progress and well we

362
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:44,170
think we're reaching the point of

363
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:47,080
diminishing returns in that regard it is

364
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,900
now considered simply good hygiene to

365
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,970
have HTTPS and it's an accepted norm

366
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,100
just like anyone in this room is

367
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:58,960
probably expected to be brushing their

368
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:00,760
teeth we expect people to do HTTPS is

369
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,650
not the only thing you need to do in

370
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:07,690
order to secure site it's just simply

371
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:09,730
part of healthy hygiene regimen so now

372
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,860
we've spent in the past little while a

373
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,510
little bit more attention on new

374
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:19,859
problems the first one being bad people

375
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:23,050
also brush their teeth so tracking

376
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,189
breaches all those sorts of things we're

377
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,589
paying a lot of attention to those sorts

378
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:29,440
of things um and we're hardening the

379
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:33,840
platform dealing with nasty things like

380
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,970
Spectre and friends and taking

381
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,999
encryption thing on to new frontiers and

382
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:42,570
that means looking at what's left

383
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:44,850
unencrypted and diving into in a little

384
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:51,899
bit more detail into things like traffic

385
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:54,090
analysis I have two things here about

386
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:57,299
DNS that we're looking at we're

387
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:00,809
experimenting with encrypted S&I that is

388
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:03,870
available in behind preferences in

389
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:08,249
various browsers and certain services

390
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:10,649
support that but the point here is that

391
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:14,460
when we think that in encrypting DNS is

392
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:16,949
a good thing but we do also care about

393
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:22,110
who gets that information and which

394
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:24,419
services we talk to so principle when it

395
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,049
comes to the trusted recursive resolver

396
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:30,240
which is the term that we came up with

397
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,200
for the combination of encrypting DNS

398
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,159
and choosing who you encrypt it toward

399
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,230
is that there is individual control and

400
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,820
importantly here there are strong

401
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:46,610
privacy promise properties out of the

402
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:50,539
default settings that people get okay

403
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:53,998
also with the wire comes the why not

404
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:55,350
this is a quote from Jeff Houston which

405
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:58,139
i think is quite relevant in this in

406
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,149
this context and it represents one of

407
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:02,100
the major challenges that were faced in

408
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:05,820
deploying this I think if it weren't for

409
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,980
the fact that DNS were used for in all

410
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,110
of these various ways and to enact

411
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,649
policy and simply because it's not

412
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,320
coherent we would have shipped it

413
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:17,668
already and there would be a large

414
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,439
number of people using something like

415
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:26,039
doe in in Firefox

416
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,629
unfortunately we might debate whether or

417
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,769
not this is an essential property of DNS

418
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,539
or whether it is an unfortunate

419
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,309
byproduct of the way that dearness is of

420
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,690
oh I don't want to get into details

421
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:37,139
about that I'm happy to have a drink

422
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:41,279
with someone on that subject but that's

423
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:44,219
not the way Genesis and of course there

424
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,690
are the long list of reasons that have

425
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,450
been presented in the various drafts I

426
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:52,410
went through a couple of those one

427
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:55,790
for not doing that and I'd like the ones

428
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:58,710
on the right the ones on the left all

429
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,740
sort of boiled down to the one effective

430
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:07,550
reason and that is that dennis is an

431
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,550
effective control point or at least was

432
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,390
oops that has a massive lag on it that's

433
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,150
really annoying okay

434
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,730
and I'm not going to go through in

435
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,250
detail why all these thing s is the case

436
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,550
but to throw a couple of examples up

437
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:30,360
here alternative known resolution

438
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:33,510
services to exist and applications have

439
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,260
name resolution or name resi resolution

440
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,550
like things built into them RFC 1738 is

441
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,420
an example of the sort of things that

442
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:45,780
I'm talking about here and if you are to

443
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:49,170
use DNS as a as a control surface you

444
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,200
also need to consider all of the ways in

445
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:56,660
which the functions that the NS provide

446
00:20:52,200 --> 00:21:00,960
might be being provided in other ways

447
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,400
and ultimately without engaging with

448
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,730
endpoints and understanding the

449
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:10,440
protocols that are involved you won't be

450
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,640
able to have effective control happened

451
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
to be a chair of a working group that's

452
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,730
dealing with this one so I thought I'd

453
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,160
throw out the slide on this one we have

454
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,660
a working group that is effectively

455
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,910
dealing with exactly the same class a

456
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,620
problem no we've kept ik models or

457
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,770
finding that the techniques that they're

458
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:29,100
using for throwing the portal page up in

459
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,440
front of someone is not as effective

460
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:36,830
when there's as much HTTP as there is in

461
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:40,050
the network today and it turns out that

462
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,689
the techniques they're almost

463
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:45,510
universally don't use DNS as the basis

464
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,550
of that there are a couple that do they

465
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,160
happen to be less effective than those

466
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,740
that concentrate on strictly

467
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,300
intercepting HTTP in clear-text but

468
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,980
we've also seen that we have less than

469
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:00,899
20% of page loads in firefox now in the

470
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,490
clear so the opportunity for someone to

471
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:09,020
do that in

472
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:10,880
is rapidly diminishing yeah content

473
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:16,000
filtering this is one of the hard

474
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:19,480
problems for us using DNS names to

475
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,370
decide whether content is allowed or not

476
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,710
only works in the very broadest sense it

477
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,040
can do things like over block and under

478
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,809
block even for instance if you have a

479
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,120
particular page on a site and you want

480
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:34,280
to use DNS to block that you take out

481
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,050
the entire domain and when I say at the

482
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,570
entire domain and I mean not just that

483
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,010
origin but every co-hosted origin you

484
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:44,629
can have you can have quite a lot of

485
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:47,000
collateral damage and doing a search on

486
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,610
things like parental controls all of

487
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,770
them that I found from the first

488
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:56,959
searches that I did were all endpoint

489
00:22:51,770 --> 00:23:04,370
software as a result so that was my

490
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:07,850
conclusion a few more thoughts on the

491
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:11,330
subject and we have to regard DNS as

492
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,740
plumbing one of the things that we're

493
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,270
struggling with here

494
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:22,370
is that we get requests throw this

495
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:25,550
problem on our users and that from our

496
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,979
perspective is unacceptable

497
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,590
these are people that have other things

498
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,740
to do and they only care about these

499
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,928
things when it stops working and we

500
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,580
would be doing them a disservice if we

501
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:44,410
were forcing them to make decisions on

502
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:44,409
these points so where do we go from here

503
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:56,929
long time applications will encrypt what

504
00:23:50,809 --> 00:24:01,399
they can they will choose who and what

505
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:06,620
they will trust with information and in

506
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,990
order to engage with end systems and

507
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,250
exert control you'll have to don't talk

508
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:14,620
to the person who owns the machine

509
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:17,470
that's being operated that is how

510
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,350
ideal situation that we get into and

511
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,940
that is you can't come in from the

512
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,709
outside and impose your will upon

513
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:30,220
someone without actually talking to them

514
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:32,230
and getting their consent in the short

515
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,110
term however we recognize that people

516
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,409
still heavily rely on on tennis for many

517
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:40,870
of these use cases and there are many

518
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:44,889
legitimate uses for the sorts of

519
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,899
controls that people have networks and

520
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:51,219
so what we're looking to do is have some

521
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:53,469
way to disable DNS at the application

522
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,139
layer and the secured trusted resolve

523
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,659
wasn't all of that business where those

524
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:59,590
controls are in place and it's quite

525
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:01,480
difficult for us to actually

526
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,820
automatically detect these things but

527
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:09,789
we'd like to find some ways you know in

528
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:13,299
in which we can do that and I think we

529
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:16,149
hope that others will agree with us

530
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:17,918
though I suspect they'll have a lively

531
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:21,248
discussion on this on this topic that

532
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,619
this is a stopgap measure only and our

533
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:28,139
policy will evolve as the ecosystem the

534
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:31,570
balls and that's all I have thank you

535
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:33,610
thank you um we have maybe time for one

536
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:39,340
very curricular vacation question if one

537
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:41,559
of you has one for what I see color dr.

538
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,689
Jennings

539
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,850
as you know I support this very same

540
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,159
view on this but you you talked about

541
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,259
encrypting DNS I don't really think

542
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,450
that's the goal that that is a mechanism

543
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:54,249
along the goal obviously but I think we

544
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,960
have to be honest too about the fact

545
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:57,850
that one of the things that's still

546
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,559
revealed that we need to be working away

547
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,389
on in this whole thing is the next thing

548
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,279
which is instantly we use this DNS

549
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:05,498
information to make a connection to an

550
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,149
address and nearly all the information

551
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:09,519
that was in the encrypted DNS query is

552
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,229
instantly revealed two seconds later now

553
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,789
of course it's not that I don't think we

554
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,039
shouldn't bankrupt the DNS it's that I

555
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:17,350
think we need to solve both of these on

556
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,809
our path not just the first one yeah

557
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:23,799
thank you all right Thank You Martin

558
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,440
Warren is on the agenda but he seems

559
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,830
confused by being on the agenda

560
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:37,150
okay sorry we didn't know whoever is is

561
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:47,679
warrants okay great thank you Oh a

562
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:51,550
diesel mess it up you don't have slides

563
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:55,300
correct I don't know how handsome yet

564
00:26:51,550 --> 00:27:00,040
nice light so my name is Kenji

565
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:03,610
bow on Chrome I'm a product manager I

566
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,920
work on loading api's and university s

567
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:10,149
is one thing among you need different

568
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:13,170
products so I can explain essentially

569
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:16,780
like the basic principles that we have

570
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,130
so first of all I think at some point it

571
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,700
was some confusion about whether or not

572
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:25,960
we intended to force a DNS change to

573
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,700
have all our users to use your DNS we

574
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,790
don't want to do that for a couple of

575
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,620
reasons one is that some of the users

576
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,590
are currently using

577
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:38,320
Adina's provider and that dns providers

578
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:41,169
is offering different like features like

579
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,210
family filtering malware detection and

580
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,760
whatnot that might not be the right way

581
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,310
to do it but it's currently the way

582
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,950
those users are experiencing the

583
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:53,530
internet and so if suddenly they lose

584
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,290
this feature just by us forcing a new

585
00:27:53,530 --> 00:28:00,340
dns on them it could potentially create

586
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:03,430
some breakage of user expectations so

587
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:07,389
that's the first point the second point

588
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:10,330
is that we have a lot of customers in

589
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:13,330
enterprise and education and so for

590
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:16,090
those we want to let them be in charge

591
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:19,419
of the whole user experience and so

592
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:22,419
typical means that we have group policy

593
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,950
that administrator can set so that they

594
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,400
can decide whether on owner they won't

595
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:31,420
do and if they won't do which like those

596
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,400
have already one to use yeah so I think

597
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,350
those are the main points that I talked

598
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:40,090
about in an email that I sent a while

599
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:45,428
ago on the ITF changes the latest update

600
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:48,100
is that I think last week I think we

601
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:51,190
sent a PSA to our public mailing list

602
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,070
explaining our current step which is we

603
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,960
want to do an experiment to make sure

604
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,600
that the intervention that we have in

605
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,720
Chrome is reasonable that it performs

606
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,699
well doesn't crash and whatnot so this

607
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,260
is just an experiment it's not meant to

608
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,429
be something that we are going to ship

609
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:12,789
as is and what we do is essentially we

610
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:17,100
have a very short table of jeana's

611
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:19,929
provider that we know support though and

612
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,629
so we reached out to a couple of

613
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:25,419
providers and at the moment we have five

614
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,750
of them that are interested in

615
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:30,850
participating and complied with a set of

616
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,330
criteria that we we felt we're good to

617
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,100
start with

618
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,899
in term of like doing an experiment I

619
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:39,158
can share more details about that if

620
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:40,870
people are interested and so yeah so

621
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,440
we're not changing the DNS we're just

622
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,289
looking

623
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,230
what genus the user as can be using and

624
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:49,690
if it's one among the list we are going

625
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,270
to upgrade the DOE version of that

626
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:55,809
provider and so the intent is to measure

627
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,460
performance metrics like heads matrix

628
00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:00,428
stability and whatnot you to make sure

629
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,529
that what we have is good what happened

630
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:05,770
after that is really there are a lot of

631
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:08,890
open questions especially if you think

632
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:11,529
about like maybe should we have a UX

633
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,539
that let users like this scientific one

634
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:17,020
of this option how do we communicate

635
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:18,250
that if the word to pick this version do

636
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,799
user expectation that they currently

637
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,720
have might not hold true anymore because

638
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,730
this provider doesn't do family self

639
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,110
featuring for instance you know a lot of

640
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,809
things like that we still need to

641
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:32,020
understand and there are also countries

642
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:36,940
like the UK where they are set of things

643
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:38,740
in your loan that has the ISP with like

644
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,020
a couple of ways mozi keys in terment

645
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,720
like filtering things and whatnot and so

646
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,580
i don't have but if you need to answer

647
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,350
all like how we should go about that and

648
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,320
i'm hoping that we can run discussion

649
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:53,860
about news in this above and the ITF

650
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,629
this week thank you we've time again

651
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:00,969
a very short clarification questions

652
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:04,980
which people have them great thank you

653
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:08,670
then this is like the timing works

654
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,670
gentlemen I think you're up next right

655
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:20,470
this you okay thanks very much I'm going

656
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,750
to keep this data very shot look it's

657
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,790
another aspects of this whole problem

658
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,830
space around the use of the moon

659
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,250
technologists that just slightly to

660
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,928
about as we go forwards the use of that

661
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,600
and manly the focuses on the use of

662
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,640
small things like alt tape devices web

663
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,399
browsers and so on and there's a

664
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,360
questions there about some of the

665
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,130
operational policies that hope these

666
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,860
things are configured how are these

667
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,299
devices and how these applications going

668
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,219
to do trust management how are they

669
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:50,200
going to get a trust anchor would be

670
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,360
some combination like we in Dane was it

671
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,559
going to be something else

672
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,668
how am I going to go over these keys

673
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:56,799
when I've gotten all the vendor

674
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:58,570
certificates that use it for that and

675
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,730
also how they could have some kind of

676
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,649
device configuration policy when we

677
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,679
tried all fast then fall back to dock

678
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,299
then fall back to vanilla dns should

679
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,830
that be retrofitted and destroyed and

680
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:12,120
suddenly I think that's potential and

681
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,960
EDF may work to look at specially

682
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,540
similar we have to look at the key

683
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,880
issues roundabouts was configurator for

684
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,918
there's other configuration also

685
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,200
discovering mechanisms how can these

686
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,059
devices and applications find a suitable

687
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,669
resolver that they're supposed to use

688
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,928
Abel's provided on the local network are

689
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:31,120
living is provided by the vendor

690
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:32,440
themselves and if you want to have the

691
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,570
situation from large numbers these

692
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,870
things perhaps have these IP addresses

693
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:40,389
hardwired into them and that potentially

694
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:42,159
potential disruptive now from my point

695
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,590
of view this also is like state lease of

696
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,790
the bleedin obvious but the fact they're

697
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,500
just not really written down anywhere

698
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,850
and I think that's potentially something

699
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,730
that really needs to be documented

700
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:55,689
somehow somewhere and I think myself

701
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,740
maybe the ATF make the posted second

702
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,490
name there's a way that issues of

703
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,020
knowing the whole issues of

704
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,520
documentation issues there was quite a

705
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,830
number of big gaps there that I think

706
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,970
need to be filled we started to figure

707
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,949
out ways to try and mitigate the

708
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,370
security risks of the use of these

709
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,290
technologies

710
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,309
these things to be used well but we also

711
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,110
have to understand the potential

712
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:14,389
downsides and printed houses if they're

713
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,500
not used in the appropriate way I think

714
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,270
I also have to look at some of the

715
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,630
threat model stuff and use cases because

716
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,950
that doesn't seem to have been done yet

717
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,690
and also concerns about potential

718
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,730
information leakages well how to

719
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:28,970
minimize the risk of that happening as

720
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:31,340
well and then also another big concern

721
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,830
something that really worries me is the

722
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,830
potential for malice or accidental

723
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,020
damage for example if the resolving

724
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,550
server gets compromised in some way and

725
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,220
I'm using the term resolving sever

726
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,760
deliberately loosely in effect starts

727
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,440
humming like bad data to the end clients

728
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,990
hurricanoes end clients well I did that

729
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,340
data or disregard that say for example

730
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,860
if they're giving a bogus information

731
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:57,040
and sending people to a fake version of

732
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,209
a bank's website or whatever it may be

733
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,000
so I think that's another to be looked

734
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:04,220
at and a real worry I have is if these

735
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,170
things are compromised or taken an IOT

736
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,810
time setting the potentials of down

737
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,429
stage can create nasty you know some of

738
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,230
the stats which you're killing your

739
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:14,090
toaster for another save the world or

740
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,770
this signals a door lock on your house

741
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,110
while you're away from home and nothing

742
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,070
can be done about it so I think that's

743
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,899
another thing there could be at least

744
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,300
documented and looked at and maybe this

745
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:25,580
is something I think that the ATF

746
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:30,230
Koopman house t-con board and authority

747
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:31,940
equations if I need Thanks so we have

748
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,740
quite a few minutes left

749
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,030
dubov clarification questions or we can

750
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:40,899
save two minutes and use them at the end

751
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,899
clarification questions for them

752
00:34:43,530 --> 00:35:05,950
everybody had very heavy lunches hi my

753
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:12,730
name is David's colossi I woke a googol

754
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:15,609
and this is a proposal for how I like

755
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,349
servers communicate dough so I'm gonna

756
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:19,540
just could make a very like overview

757
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:21,400
presentation of this and I I personally

758
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,960
believe that it fits in with what's been

759
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,880
discussed before in terms of like the

760
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,670
model and how we reason about dough and

761
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:32,829
this is just maybe one more tool we

762
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:34,569
could have in our dough toolbox so this

763
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:39,910
is also work with the NYX oven and Jesse

764
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:42,520
Kip at a flair so one problem with some

765
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,799
of the dough deployments today is that

766
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,410
some browsers will just send all of

767
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,560
their DNS to one dose over so two odd

768
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:52,569
cloud provider and so that has two

769
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,569
problems on one hand it's inefficient

770
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:59,140
because let's say if you're resolving

771
00:35:55,569 --> 00:36:02,020
names that use DNS for load balancing or

772
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,549
DNS for geographical picking

773
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,950
geographically picking the right data

774
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:07,359
center going through a doe server that's

775
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,180
all the way somewhere else might be

776
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,060
inefficient also you expose all of your

777
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:17,290
browsing history to that DNS provider

778
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:19,660
also on ideal so how can we move forward

779
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,970
it's helped their people or don't word

780
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:26,200
option by not having these problems as

781
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:28,598
much so the proposed solution or a

782
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,328
proposed solution is somewhat inspired

783
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,589
by HSTs but don't think about it too

784
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:36,550
much that way because that is a terrible

785
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:39,759
analogy and the idea is the HTTP server

786
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:43,000
the origin tells the client by the way I

787
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,520
also run a doe server and if you want to

788
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,730
resolve me I would prefer you use this

789
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,430
one but client is completely free to do

790
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,280
what it wants you could ignore this and

791
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:55,720
so the cur proposals HTTP header it

792
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,790
looks like this and it basically gives

793
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,250
you a doe

794
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,250
I and an H because it has to be cashed

795
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:07,740
the one way to deploy this which I think

796
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:11,940
is practical is we already have history

797
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,799
right now where there is a number of DOE

798
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,450
servers it's not incredibly large and

799
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,190
some of them have been vetted in terms

800
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:20,100
of like how much data they log and all

801
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:22,920
that and so browsers can have a list of

802
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,470
those dos servers in the UI but one

803
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,030
thing you can do is if as a browser you

804
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,439
have that list and you receive this

805
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,750
header for something that's in the list

806
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,860
you can say okay when I want to visit

807
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,620
this website

808
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:38,850
I will go to that list so one example is

809
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:40,830
if like you have a big CDN for all of

810
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:44,509
the websites that CDN serves they can

811
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:46,830
say this is the DOE server of that CDN

812
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:49,110
so you don't end up having to resolve to

813
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:53,580
another CDN who doesn't really want to

814
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:55,140
give you the best results one important

815
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,230
point and this is what makes it very

816
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,569
different from HSTs is that this is a

817
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,720
performance feature allows you to skip

818
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:05,910
jump through another doe server it's not

819
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,250
a security feature so you can fall back

820
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,350
if that doe server that was recommended

821
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,540
doesn't work you fall back to whatever

822
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,339
yes mechanisms you had before that could

823
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:19,980
be another doe server it could be TNS or

824
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:22,770
5380 whatever you generally use and one

825
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,380
point that was brought up that I want to

826
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:28,230
mention is like anything that the client

827
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,350
caches it can be used as a tracking

828
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,910
vector or super cookie so you want to

829
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,990
implement if what we ever want to move

830
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,359
forward with this we want to employ

831
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:39,839
mitigations such as only having a small

832
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:42,480
list of what those servers there are to

833
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,150
avoid this service is providing one

834
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,230
unique do--you're i per client and

835
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:51,960
allowing tracking and of course you also

836
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,490
want to double key this caching of

837
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,070
information based on the origin and

838
00:38:53,490 --> 00:39:00,589
iframes and everything to avoid these

839
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:04,650
concerns and that's all I had it's a

840
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:07,690
simple concept I think you will have

841
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:10,339
clarification questions

842
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,529
it's the usual suspects they never had

843
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:14,720
starvation questions you still feel free

844
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:18,430
to this is Dan O'Connor Gilmer I'm

845
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,288
asking a clarification question you said

846
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:23,598
just to clarify what the dope reference

847
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:26,150
header would mean he said it you use it

848
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,589
to look up but you didn't say what

849
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,289
domain names it would look up so I think

850
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:31,490
it would be useful to clarify the scope

851
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:34,279
of what the dope reference head it

852
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,049
refers to sorry that is indeed the most

853
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:38,180
important part of the talk I might have

854
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:41,089
forgotten that so let's say if you go to

855
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:43,940
browse to HTTP called Sascha example.com

856
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:47,690
it is for that same origin and that

857
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,920
origin only so you add a header like

858
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,680
next time you want to resolve

859
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,809
example.com you come to this doe server

860
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,230
not for any other domain name children

861
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:59,839
domains domain means a records only non

862
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:04,279
a records are currently it is very

863
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:07,339
strictly to that origin the exact name

864
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:09,829
the exact name only for a in Quad a

865
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:12,558
records or other names other other types

866
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:14,269
we don't currently specify that that's a

867
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,460
good question I guess I would assume

868
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:18,140
mainly in quad-a but there are other

869
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,720
talks of new records that are important

870
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,038
in this space so maybe just for all

871
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:28,669
records on that name could be the right

872
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:30,559
way to go yeah I mean this is this is

873
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,910
very interesting work this means no

874
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,130
coverage of it in this kind of thing for

875
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,839
a while so I'm glad to see McCord I

876
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,239
think there's some technical details

877
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:43,069
from not entirely sure I love here but

878
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:45,349
um you know something work out I think

879
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:47,390
the perhaps why this interesting

880
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:49,670
question is is it worth trying to expand

881
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,779
the scope on I say two points one is it

882
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,849
we're trying to span the scope outside

883
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:54,289
of just the origin itself two children

884
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:56,359
demands for instance or other domains in

885
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:58,940
the surf um there are questions worth

886
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:00,380
asking is it worth priming this is this

887
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,749
thing with an IP address for the

888
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,910
resolver because one difficulty here is

889
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:06,950
because if if what you are is your

890
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,839
Facebook and you operate you know DSM

891
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,569
facebook.com and W at Facebook they come

892
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:13,190
and what has to happen is that every

893
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,989
time I want to go to and that those at

894
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,210
the same TTL then every time I go to

895
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:20,269
facebook.com I could hook up a facepalm

896
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,220
be my primary solver and obviously I can

897
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,890
release all my problem

898
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,689
so on I may be solved with long TTL and

899
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,618
a versus B but it's a problem that has

900
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,580
to be go away because otherwise you

901
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,770
won't get parties benefit you or

902
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,270
something well close the lines already

903
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,560
because we wanted to clarification

904
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,240
questions and they're getting extremely

905
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,910
detailed which is not what this was

906
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,939
supposed to be about so um please keep

907
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:41,710
it at the clarification level thanks and

908
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,119
yeah that is a good question

909
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:48,390
these are open questions that we can dig

910
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:51,880
in later can you clarify whether or not

911
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:53,710
when you say NS dot example of that is

912
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,140
there no any notion that this genius

913
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:58,750
partner has to be operated by the same

914
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,598
company and if not does it mean the user

915
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:06,390
has to trust not only that website but

916
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:09,849
also it's like also provider as

917
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:12,520
currently documented it doesn't require

918
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:14,230
any like cooperation between these two

919
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,920
because I don't think that's enforceable

920
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:24,340
from a client that example.com is served

921
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:29,950
by CDN fubar but the so what exactly is

922
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:33,599
the the concern would be maybe as a user

923
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:40,390
I trust example.com but I don't trust

924
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:42,609
evil God's example dotnet so and this is

925
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,799
why this is very clearly a preference

926
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:47,650
and so example.com tells you

927
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,869
I like DNS at evil calm as a user you

928
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,940
say no sorry I don't like cable calm I'm

929
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:56,040
not gonna follow your preference so it's

930
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,040
it becomes a local fine to policy matter

931
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:04,210
robber story you see is I you say that

932
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,319
this is for performance but the doser

933
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,780
with the hand you might not necessarily

934
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,210
be that the closest one your ISP might

935
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,339
be most closer and it might be an

936
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:16,170
initial hit but then the cache is it

937
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:19,450
would be faster go through your ISP

938
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,369
absolutely and so then it becomes the

939
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:24,580
responsibility of whoever so in that

940
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:27,730
website to try to be smart about how

941
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:30,670
their users or what the best server is

942
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,859
for that at the end of the day if they

943
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,540
were thorough server that they run is

944
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:36,250
further

945
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,990
and yeah then they should just say use

946
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:44,170
your eyes peas but thank you David

947
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:49,399
thank you Chris you're up next

948
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:49,400
[Music]

949
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:09,690
okay hi so I'm Chris box and II fiddler

950
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:11,400
is connected remotely like Andy I what

951
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:15,620
could be teal that like specializes in

952
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:19,910
the design of the EE mobile network so

953
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:22,890
this is two tasks whether there is

954
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:26,690
consensus that there are issues that we

955
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:29,640
need to to resolve so one of those is

956
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:31,380
the doke protocol creates technical

957
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:37,350
challenges for operators and other

958
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:42,000
providers and as an example so we are

959
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:44,940
looking at deploying it well creating a

960
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,340
proof of concept of of the dope doze

961
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,460
over in our network so that we can then

962
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:53,520
assess if it's viable how we're gonna

963
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,250
roll out the network but in order to

964
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,020
prove that viability we need to address

965
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,510
these challenges which are commodity

966
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:06,120
could you look at the total immigrant

967
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:08,430
yep so the the the ITF we think should

968
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,529
consider developing at a best current

969
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:13,710
practice which documents these concerns

970
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:17,340
and provide the appropriate guidance so

971
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:19,710
for come on to what those are so the

972
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,710
first is how operators and enterprise

973
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,930
networks can offer Doh and dot service

974
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:31,260
most of these issues are common to both

975
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:36,180
Dell and dogs so this in part results

976
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:39,060
around discovery of local resolve which

977
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,710
result as are available what policies do

978
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,710
they have privacy policies other

979
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:46,890
features and selection of that now that

980
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:50,820
there are two existing drafts and I'm

981
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:54,080
aware of there talking to this space you

982
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:57,540
need to build a complete picture there

983
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:00,000
also how these operator and enterprise

984
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,880
dos servers can be used across home

985
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,680
mobile and enterprise networks so when

986
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,250
obviously when there's mobility between

987
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,049
those networks there's gonna be a

988
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,610
process of discovery and selection and

989
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,840
you're not always going to want to

990
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,840
choose the local resolver

991
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:22,260
we could also do with assessing what's

992
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:25,020
the impact of this technology on network

993
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:30,140
and server performance on load testing

994
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:35,030
on capacity and resilience planning so

995
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:40,020
one example of that is the the lack of

996
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:43,970
ECS client subnet drive changes in where

997
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:46,200
the traffic is present on the network

998
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:50,850
also the impact on existing

999
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:53,790
infrastructure so low balances captive

1000
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:55,170
pools as we mentioned nat64 has that

1001
00:46:53,790 --> 00:47:00,150
going to work

1002
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:04,080
proxies CD ends the impact of the

1003
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:06,330
customer premises equipment so out of

1004
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,759
the box when the customer first opens it

1005
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:13,170
and puts it event system how are they

1006
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:17,460
going to connect and be taken through

1007
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:20,250
that process should we have a doe

1008
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,900
resolver on of the CPE like we do it

1009
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,070
them but while we did we have a DNS

1010
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:27,620
resolver at the moment

1011
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:30,120
what's its role in this new environment

1012
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,859
how do we manage the certificates if it

1013
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:37,020
is going to be offering its own doe

1014
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:39,030
service they're providing donat servers

1015
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,060
in split DNS environments this has been

1016
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:45,030
mentioned a number of times and over xur

1017
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:47,880
there's a draft which is attempting to

1018
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:51,930
address this issue so I hope that covers

1019
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,690
it off completely the interactions

1020
00:47:51,930 --> 00:48:00,810
between applications and operating

1021
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:03,630
system DNS settings so do we do we

1022
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:09,330
conclude that it is better for the

1023
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:12,750
operating system to to implement the to

1024
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:18,060
be the DNS client the advantage there is

1025
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:19,830
that it is one point that holds the

1026
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:24,360
settings the preferences and the

1027
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:26,460
selection or is it better for the

1028
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,230
applications do that and if we do if we

1029
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:31,680
say the applications need to do

1030
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:36,750
that opens up the issues of managing all

1031
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:40,049
that diversity if it's in the operating

1032
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:42,810
system we then need to go on to what are

1033
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:45,089
the right preferences in the operating

1034
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:46,970
system what do we need to expose to the

1035
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:51,680
user so that they can say what they want

1036
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:51,680
from from their DNS provider

1037
00:48:52,310 --> 00:49:00,690
how do clients will handle policy

1038
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:03,598
negotiation the service so we we've

1039
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:06,320
mentioned privacy policies err there's a

1040
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:10,140
draft that says yes we can learn about

1041
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:12,990
this resolver offers these policies and

1042
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:16,740
features but also could this be

1043
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:19,169
negotiation could be could the client

1044
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:25,560
device say I'm willing to accept

1045
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:28,109
ECS prefix length of this or if any I'm

1046
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,779
not willing to accept any ECS I'd rather

1047
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:33,560
it was not sent could that be a

1048
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,560
negotiation

1049
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:44,710
the if it's if the DNS is presented

1050
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:47,310
simply an operating system that's that's

1051
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:50,380
one case if we think there is a role for

1052
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:56,320
applications to manage their DNS

1053
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:57,820
settings then let's say okay we have we

1054
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,160
have ten different applications on this

1055
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:03,670
device they've all got different

1056
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:05,109
selections if there's also security

1057
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,530
software on that device like an

1058
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:10,690
anti-virus or something that's

1059
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:12,609
attempting to secure the device is that

1060
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:17,619
security software going to have the

1061
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:20,799
ability to do audit the DNS selections

1062
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:23,770
of all the applications you know so they

1063
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,349
can ensure that that malware has not

1064
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:29,650
submitted one of them decided to send

1065
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:33,579
yeah the Facebook app to a different

1066
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:34,950
destination obviously an easier task if

1067
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:38,730
it's only the operating system but

1068
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,730
settings that need to be checked

1069
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:48,130
authentication of doand got resolved so

1070
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,430
let's say that my device is on the ITF

1071
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:54,940
Wi-Fi I've discovered that there is an

1072
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:57,848
ITF doe resolver I've learned about its

1073
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:00,220
policies I check that against my users

1074
00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:02,440
preferences the user says yeah if

1075
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:07,618
there's a good resolver it's local it's

1076
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,619
really private and secure use that one

1077
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:15,460
we need to state what how do we what are

1078
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:18,549
the authentication steps we need to go

1079
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:20,349
through to confirm that it really is the

1080
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:22,470
ITF and it's not just someone saying we

1081
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:22,470
are

1082
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:30,640
there's management of TLS sessions at

1083
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:33,750
DNS query rates so what do we do with

1084
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:37,690
ticket durations with restarts and

1085
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:40,630
finally the options that operators can

1086
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:44,339
use to to minimize the TLS overheads for

1087
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,339
the DOE and dock traffic

1088
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:52,950
so that that was an example list of

1089
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:56,069
areas that we think there is there is a

1090
00:51:52,950 --> 00:52:01,890
need for some work some of them are

1091
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:04,410
already being worked on so this is just

1092
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:09,240
an open question to say who's willing to

1093
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:13,950
work to identify the items that do

1094
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:18,810
require work with somewhere to check

1095
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:22,169
that overlap and if we identify there is

1096
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:24,960
something who are the volunteers to work

1097
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,490
on it thank you

1098
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,380
in lieu of them clarification questions

1099
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:34,140
lined up Barbara Barbara stark AT&T

1100
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:37,140
thank you for bringing this on I'm glad

1101
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:40,080
to see that one of the presentations

1102
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:42,660
today actually looked at operator

1103
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:46,140
network operator issues I'm quite

1104
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:47,910
honestly given that the list of drafts

1105
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,160
that sort of precipitated having this

1106
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:52,830
Boff were all about operational concerns

1107
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,620
I was actually kind of surprised that

1108
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:58,500
only one out of six presentations

1109
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:02,130
actually tried to say we need to talk

1110
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:04,980
about operational concerns as a network

1111
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:08,370
operator I can tell you that this has

1112
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:10,860
risen now to one of the top concerns as

1113
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:14,100
to the potential impact that this can

1114
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:17,250
have on changing Network patterns where

1115
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:19,290
traffic comes from the paths traffic

1116
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,240
takes coming into our network will it

1117
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:23,460
still use some of those private hearing

1118
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:30,330
links if it's being resolved by somebody

1119
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:32,700
else the potential on calls to our help

1120
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,850
desk when things don't work the way

1121
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,950
they're expected to work on those calls

1122
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:40,080
aren't going to be going to CloudFlare

1123
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,580
or Google or Mozilla or any of those

1124
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,980
they're going to be coming to our help

1125
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:48,569
desks this is huge

1126
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:50,550
we've got to work on this and it needs

1127
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:53,070
to not be given short shrift or

1128
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:55,830
shortchanged in any way and quite

1129
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:57,870
honestly absolutely I want to work on

1130
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,750
these things with you wherever they

1131
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:01,089
happen

1132
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:04,060
um I'd really like to see if at least

1133
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:06,490
one of the chairs if there is an a DD

1134
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:10,680
group is an operator so that it's not

1135
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:12,790
that operators are some sideline here

1136
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:18,790
apologize this by no means that we want

1137
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:21,490
to fight line operators right and I'm

1138
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:23,230
glad I'm glad people agree so this is

1139
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,549
probably on the chair is mostly for not

1140
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,200
reaching out more and trying to get

1141
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,600
additional operator presentations lined

1142
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,629
up but we did manage to get one which

1143
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,569
we're now quite happy about before also

1144
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:39,010
but but yeah obviously we agree um and

1145
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:40,480
thank you for clarifying that Terri

1146
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,740
mandersohn no particular hat would you

1147
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,370
mind going back to the previous slide

1148
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,970
please

1149
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:47,319
sure would you consider the

1150
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:50,020
authentication requirements for doe and

1151
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,790
DOD resolvers or protection of

1152
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:55,600
application specific doe and deity

1153
00:54:51,790 --> 00:55:00,070
resolver configuration to cover the the

1154
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:02,910
trust anchor store issue and ensuring

1155
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:05,670
that the appropriate gating and

1156
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:12,009
validation and sanctity of the ta store

1157
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:14,110
is in that scope and if not why so I

1158
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,810
don't know what the the right answer is

1159
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:20,290
but I just know that yes though there

1160
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:22,509
are there is work to be done to define

1161
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:24,670
exactly how the all this can can be

1162
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:27,100
operated securely perhaps then you might

1163
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:31,780
want to add that as another yeah this

1164
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:34,779
this isn't intended to be a there is

1165
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:41,320
work there just a glaring gap in my mind

1166
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:43,660
so thank you why why is this about doe

1167
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,250
I think the first slide is the first

1168
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,920
bullet on the first flight is incorrect

1169
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:50,140
the DOE protocol itself does not create

1170
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,150
any of these technical challenges the

1171
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:54,609
technical challenges are created by

1172
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:57,100
using a server that is not the one that

1173
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:58,690
the network configures you to use so

1174
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,259
this is not specific to doe it's not

1175
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:04,150
specific to dot if you weren't able to

1176
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:07,140
if the operator weren't already able to

1177
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:09,940
rewrite and man-in-the-middle UDP DNS

1178
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:12,549
which they are today the same problems

1179
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:15,329
would exist so I think you know with

1180
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:17,619
framing in terms of dough is wrong I

1181
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:20,529
happen not to have a duplication we have

1182
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:23,049
a duty implementation Android and that

1183
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:25,029
creates some of the challenges but we it

1184
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:26,949
actually doesn't create many of the

1185
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:29,140
challenges you have here because we

1186
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:31,809
chose not to change the deployment model

1187
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,989
and to use either or user selective DNS

1188
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:36,849
result resolver or to use to upgrade the

1189
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:41,319
network provided resolver to encryption

1190
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:43,059
and so it may seem kind of specious but

1191
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:47,279
I think it's it's unfair to blame doe

1192
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:49,539
for this what the problem is is that

1193
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:52,179
application selection or a client

1194
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:54,219
selection of the DNS resolver the thing

1195
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:55,660
is that right now the network tells the

1196
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:57,579
client what to use and the client

1197
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,219
doesn't want to do that anymore so I

1198
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:03,249
think you blaming the protocol for that

1199
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:09,789
is like shooting the messenger yes so I

1200
00:57:03,249 --> 00:57:13,209
would say it's it's it is RFC 84-84 that

1201
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:15,249
has brought this to the point where it's

1202
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:18,969
it's likely that there's going to be a

1203
00:57:15,249 --> 00:57:23,368
big transition of of the DNS traffic I

1204
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:28,390
agree yes it if the ISP is deploying a

1205
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:30,429
doe server or any kind of encrypted DNS

1206
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:33,368
server and the devices are all using

1207
00:57:30,429 --> 00:57:36,400
that and a lot of the issues become much

1208
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:38,400
easier there are still some that remains

1209
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,539
such as how do you manage that traffic

1210
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,910
cut the lines for the clarification

1211
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:46,029
questions after Kathleen and then please

1212
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:50,678
be quick and I'm glad to see this turns

1213
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:52,390
out to be a clapping contest now Ted

1214
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:54,339
Hardy if you could go forward just to

1215
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:56,078
the Middle's like please first I'm very

1216
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:57,849
very sorry that this was not an

1217
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,880
exhaustive list because I was very tired

1218
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:02,529
after reading it and I'm really sorry

1219
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,839
that you're having all of these issues I

1220
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:07,089
tend to agree with what Lorenzo caliche

1221
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:11,499
said though that a fair number of these

1222
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:14,640
issues occur if you let the user trust

1223
00:58:11,499 --> 00:58:17,529
whatever DNS they're going to trust

1224
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,118
irrespective of whether that it's

1225
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:23,049
transported in clear text whether it's

1226
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:25,239
transported over a TLS or overall age

1227
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:26,500
and I also think that there's a fair

1228
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:29,760
number of these where

1229
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,170
the performance side of this there's

1230
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,210
really kind of no difference between

1231
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:35,890
this performance issue and the d-o-t

1232
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:38,020
performance issues right you're gonna

1233
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,609
see TLS start times you'll have a

1234
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,550
concern about that you'll have HTTP

1235
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:44,260
overhead you need to do a bunch of that

1236
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:46,510
stuff if what you're just looking at is

1237
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:48,070
result for performance if what you're

1238
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,080
looking at is is the sorts of issues

1239
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,520
that barber will bring up about where

1240
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,240
the traffic is coming into your network

1241
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:57,460
I think that's again though because

1242
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,100
you're not letting the user control the

1243
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:02,320
resolution if you look at any mechanism

1244
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,330
by which the user is in control of the

1245
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,480
resolution you can get these results and

1246
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:09,759
I think before you go and ask the

1247
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,700
question on your final slide looking for

1248
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,650
overlap with deprive toh other

1249
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:16,960
operational group if you really handy

1250
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:21,730
just to go through this and say if I let

1251
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:23,620
the user trust a resolver on of their

1252
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:28,000
choice and did not make any efforts to

1253
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:30,790
insert a resolver over and above their

1254
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,790
their initial choice does this same

1255
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,500
thing happen yes or no in similar for

1256
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:37,300
the performance issues once you have

1257
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,920
that trusted answer no matter where

1258
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:41,380
you've got it would this same

1259
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,960
performance issue happen yes or no and I

1260
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:46,570
think the result of that once you've got

1261
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,520
got rid of all the ones where there's

1262
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:50,860
this huge overlap you could really

1263
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,990
narrow down into things an abd group

1264
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,880
would do I think the others are not

1265
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:57,189
necessarily unimportant but if you

1266
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,260
tackle them for just this one delivery

1267
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:02,260
mechanism you actually haven't tackled

1268
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,910
your problem very well at all I had cut

1269
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:05,950
the lines after Kathleen I'm sorry

1270
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:07,509
business seriously codification

1271
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,069
questions and we do have one more

1272
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:11,680
presentation and then the longer open

1273
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:15,880
mic session okay I'm sorry

1274
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:18,100
yeah no I was still like Kathleen I can

1275
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,820
you also did this you decided you're not

1276
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:24,790
aligned anymore okay Kenji from Google I

1277
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:27,370
just wanted to know to say that I've

1278
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:29,860
spent a lot of time talking to the ISPs

1279
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:31,690
and I've learned a lot in process and I

1280
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:34,300
feel that like you look around like

1281
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:37,810
there is a lot of people there are some

1282
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,320
hard questions to solve and I don't have

1283
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,099
any service

1284
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,769
and so

1285
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:44,809
if there are things on that slide maybe

1286
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:47,988
not on the slide that we we could have

1287
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:52,190
ways that are rational I think we should

1288
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:55,130
consider them Thank You Kathleen

1289
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:57,440
Moriarty so on the dough clients

1290
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:59,779
handling policy it's not just that it's

1291
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,239
whether they have an opportunity to

1292
01:00:59,779 --> 01:01:04,489
select what they're using for DNS so if

1293
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:07,279
the application browser on the client

1294
01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:10,819
side doesn't have a choice and they're

1295
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:13,369
not behind the network firewall to help

1296
01:01:10,819 --> 01:01:15,589
interfere with that choice they may be

1297
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,959
unaware of where their DNS is going and

1298
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:20,180
I mean there's nothing to stop a DOS or

1299
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:23,660
server from doing some of the inspection

1300
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:30,078
capabilities from you know other CMS

1301
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:33,828
services right so thank you Jim yup

1302
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:38,690
again if you can do it in nine minutes

1303
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:42,499
for exactly back on time including

1304
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:44,599
questions yeah I'll keep this very short

1305
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:46,218
and he'll just say keep it gently tight

1306
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:48,349
level thanks so much

1307
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:51,170
very very short one you know this was

1308
01:01:48,349 --> 01:01:53,209
the basis of a draft that john dickinson

1309
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,650
and herself kicked it out before the

1310
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:58,698
prank meeting but it never got to the

1311
01:01:54,650 --> 01:02:00,729
stage that this wall today but I think

1312
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:04,009
identify some other potential it is a

1313
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:06,999
potential lock and particular innovation

1314
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:09,650
is the interaction between HTTP and DNS

1315
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:11,509
between what is perhaps notional web

1316
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:14,359
server and the web browser type

1317
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:16,249
activities and the potential is there

1318
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:18,229
for things like cache motion attacks and

1319
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:21,049
hijacking and how can we deal with

1320
01:02:18,229 --> 01:02:24,169
unsolicited unsolicited HTTP POST

1321
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:26,089
messages going to the web browsers 80-43

1322
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:27,559
for us it's a little bit about that but

1323
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:29,449
I think that perhaps needs to be

1324
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:31,190
expanded and filter it a little bit more

1325
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:33,259
I think we're Pro not done enough work

1326
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:35,959
there in the threat model down looked at

1327
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:37,789
it I think that could be looked up and

1328
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:40,519
also what's going to the scope of any

1329
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:42,769
HTTP push messages is it going to be for

1330
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:45,468
the browser as a central global entity

1331
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:47,538
or if an individual frame or Taliban the

1332
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:49,459
browser what's the time to evaluate

1333
01:02:47,539 --> 01:02:51,310
those but push data that's good to be

1334
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:54,680
shot

1335
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:56,990
also maybe we need to articulate

1336
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,600
something clearly that you know whenever

1337
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:01,549
we get a DNS lookup irrespective of the

1338
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,470
transport protocol the mechanism if you

1339
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:06,200
use dots on for used or or used vanilla

1340
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:08,500
DNS we should broadly speaking get the

1341
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,790
same way same answer back every time

1342
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,960
generally speaking marginally some

1343
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:15,110
things may be said going to vote the

1344
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,760
issues of clever cast first content

1345
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:18,560
delivery networks changing the responses

1346
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,390
back but broadly speaking you should get

1347
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:23,450
the same answer that's something we

1348
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:24,980
should try to make sure is it's

1349
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:29,810
enshrined in all these and protocol

1350
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:32,240
deployments also and for web caches what

1351
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:34,370
we do about negative caching again 80 40

1352
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,020
84 sees a little bit about that but

1353
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:38,060
members a little bit more depth to be

1354
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:41,330
plotted in there no take the line the

1355
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:44,210
use of them a connection of mis- caching

1356
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:47,720
thing we've just come it as an 81 98

1357
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:49,370
film recently also there are some things

1358
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,980
that both some of the feel like some of

1359
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:54,770
the newer fancier dns features which are

1360
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:58,010
left unseen at the moment if example a

1361
01:03:54,770 --> 01:04:00,410
web client is using t sake how does the

1362
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:02,600
web browser or of the trusted resolver

1363
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:04,700
handle that he said data they shalt over

1364
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:08,120
the HTTP channel why do we do other

1365
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:09,710
things to do with Venus header bits what

1366
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:12,049
what does it mean when a web browser

1367
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:15,020
sends a query with the recursive

1368
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:17,090
precautions ahead but not set how this

1369
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:19,040
awaked resolved over do you with that

1370
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:21,200
does it give back an undercover gave an

1371
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,240
answer discipline cache does it tightens

1372
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,270
of that query I think things like that

1373
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:28,160
need to perhaps a lot also we need to

1374
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:31,250
look at potential they think other

1375
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:33,830
non-committee related DNS activities for

1376
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:36,320
example notify messages or perhaps you

1377
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:39,110
can dynamic updates should or should not

1378
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:43,570
a trusted resolver or Adobe's although

1379
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:45,890
deal with was kind of requests also

1380
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,300
should be wanna make sure that your

1381
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:49,279
honor of the a I know route if we win

1382
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,600
the public Internet I think this is a

1383
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,970
general thing that I apply is not

1384
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:55,520
adjusted or resolve was but to and for

1385
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:57,950
no DNS resolvers as well as a potential

1386
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,380
here that the potentially could be

1387
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:01,580
hijacked or bypassed or ignored and I

1388
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:04,620
think it'd be good to break something

1389
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:06,660
going about that and also gods

1390
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:10,380
interesting TNS group people mentioned

1391
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:12,299
ECS was also a DNS options should you

1392
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,220
support DNS SEC and by that what a

1393
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,980
meaning is that the trusted resolver

1394
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:18,629
should return the DNS tech related was

1395
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,520
all strikers got necessarily valuable in

1396
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:22,620
sales but passed them back to the end

1397
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,509
clients or the end client can choose to

1398
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,200
validate them for themselves if it wants

1399
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:26,970
to or not

1400
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,379
so think things like that all need to be

1401
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:30,299
explained because those requirements at

1402
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:32,790
the moment I'm not quite clear and I

1403
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:35,310
think the kind of libyans assume making

1404
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:37,170
an assumption but anybody that's

1405
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,060
operating up adored resolver will

1406
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:40,920
actually do these things and if it's a

1407
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:42,900
website it may not choose to do those

1408
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,670
activities so I think it'd be helpful if

1409
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:49,470
we try to try and clean some

1410
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:50,880
requirements yeah yes

1411
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:53,700
so I'll take any questions or

1412
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:59,280
clarifications and then open up the

1413
01:05:53,700 --> 01:06:05,910
floor for popcorn and beer Ben Schwartz

1414
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:08,400
yeah so first of all I think that this

1415
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:11,700
work is largely in scope for dough as

1416
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,410
currently chartered so if you want to

1417
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:15,810
bring this kind of work to the dough

1418
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:20,339
working group working group is open okay

1419
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:24,180
I I do want to ask a couple of questions

1420
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:28,250
do you do you think that these

1421
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:32,009
requirements do not currently exist oh

1422
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:34,230
it's a very good question and we need to

1423
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:36,480
look at a whole bunch of and I've ceased

1424
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:37,680
to know for definite but now certain

1425
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,380
things are plying that written down in

1426
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,899
terms of resolver requirements of being

1427
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,070
Jennifer a regular DNS resolver so much

1428
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,840
have anything written down that

1429
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:47,070
specifies that but I do think there's

1430
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,750
another name that perhaps needs to be

1431
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:54,950
developed in scooped a little bit

1432
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:58,910
further okay thank you and also are you

1433
01:06:54,950 --> 01:07:01,049
are you particularly concerned about

1434
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:03,629
implementations that essentially are

1435
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:07,020
buggy or fail to comply with existing

1436
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:08,940
standards or are you primarily concerned

1437
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:11,310
with implementations that are compliant

1438
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:12,930
with existing standards if they

1439
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:15,330
compliant saying I don't have any Creek

1440
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:16,680
Rober that it's not so much I think

1441
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,180
buggy or

1442
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,970
you need to implement these things but

1443
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:23,160
sorry no there's not as much buggy our

1444
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,870
faulty implementations that factors will

1445
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,450
make a minimum set of requirements we

1446
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:29,609
should expect these resolvers to

1447
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:31,560
implement and support and it's not

1448
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:34,500
really clear what that should what that

1449
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:36,690
things should be and just finally what

1450
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,580
do you see the connection what

1451
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:45,060
connection do you see between these

1452
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:47,460
these features and oh well it depends

1453
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:49,920
how the door is but in the back end in

1454
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:52,740
the server side is it going to the web

1455
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,480
server is it going to be a regular DNS

1456
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:57,419
server of the SCADA to person out there

1457
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,620
types to if it's the farmer then we have

1458
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,900
to look at these other kinds of issues

1459
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:02,759
if it's the latter some of that stuff

1460
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,740
almost certainly been implemented in

1461
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,210
banging with a front-end module or

1462
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,160
unbound to the front-end budget or

1463
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:10,410
whatever it is so broadly speaking that

1464
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,759
latter case to polish no problem but if

1465
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:15,589
it's going to be done for something else

1466
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,590
then maybe is going to be a problem I

1467
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:28,259
think versus in line or no I'm cueing

1468
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:29,969
for the next line oh oh you are right

1469
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:33,120
anybody have any more questions for Jim

1470
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:35,580
for this particular stuff no ok so we

1471
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,069
are on time and 2 minutes early which is

1472
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:40,620
excellent thank you all for being

1473
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:42,479
willing to be cut so much in time so the

1474
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:44,399
dystopia is certainly feels larger than

1475
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,689
then what would fit into one working

1476
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,609
group in the ITF traditionally that's

1477
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:48,839
very clear and and some of you know the

1478
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:50,609
work is maybe a bit more controversial

1479
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:53,010
than others that's the point I think of

1480
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:54,089
the of the buff and very correct me if

1481
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:56,550
I'm wrong is to figure out whether

1482
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:58,980
there's some of the shopping lists of

1483
01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:00,300
things that have been presented by and

1484
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:02,339
not presented anymore

1485
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,080
it's uncontroversial enough that it

1486
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,760
might find a home either in an existing

1487
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,550
working group or and the recharter the

1488
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:11,370
existing work group or an in the world

1489
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:13,950
and if you can maybe focus on making

1490
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:16,380
constructive process along those lines

1491
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:22,649
we might avoid a repeat of the last

1492
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:25,440
minute please thanks Wes verdict here is

1493
01:09:22,649 --> 01:09:27,799
a so one of the things I noticed about

1494
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:30,448
these presentations were that they were

1495
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,130
technical and down on the weeds a lot

1496
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:34,229
and in a good way but I wanted to bring

1497
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:36,089
up some sort of higher level view in

1498
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:39,689
terms of architectural II you know how

1499
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:40,859
we think about things and first off so

1500
01:09:39,689 --> 01:09:43,439
you're gonna have to bear with me for a

1501
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:45,509
minute or two but protocols are not evil

1502
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,889
right they're they're inherently

1503
01:09:45,509 --> 01:09:48,330
themselves not evil and there's a

1504
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:51,420
question whether what we do with them in

1505
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:54,600
the ATF companies forcing a protocol to

1506
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:57,120
use the info forcing a user to to use

1507
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,860
them can be kind of evil at times but

1508
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,949
most of the time you know they do it for

1509
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:04,620
the right reasons so one thing I noted

1510
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:06,570
is that we have many technologies today

1511
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,610
that send packets in different

1512
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:11,429
directions than maybe the ISP expected

1513
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:13,799
VPNs in particular do that user logs

1514
01:10:11,429 --> 01:10:15,120
into an ISP they they jump through a VPN

1515
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,760
and they're no longer sending traffic

1516
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,960
the same way well then but all the

1517
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,400
traffic is going the same way so you're

1518
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,660
really part of a different network until

1519
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,670
you get to the point of using something

1520
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:25,290
like a split VPN well when you're using

1521
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:26,640
a split VPN some of your traffic does

1522
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:29,190
some way in some traffic goes the other

1523
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,219
way and most split VPNs actually send

1524
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:34,110
all of your DNS traffic down the VPN so

1525
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,760
to some extent you NoDo and similar

1526
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:37,559
technologies where your routing stuff at

1527
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:41,360
different direction for DNS is kind of

1528
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:43,830
like using a split VPN to a large extent

1529
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,509
but there's a significant difference in

1530
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:47,850
that and I'm gonna hurt back on this a

1531
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:50,280
few times the user typically has

1532
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:52,530
awareness that they're using a split VPN

1533
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,820
or APN at all they know that the traffic

1534
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,320
is going in a different direction and

1535
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,759
they may talk to a different help desk

1536
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:01,110
if the operators earlier rogue line

1537
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:03,060
point out so what does change right

1538
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:04,559
you're let's please we got twenty

1539
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:07,340
minutes and there's 20 people in line

1540
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,800
that means everybody gets one minute

1541
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:12,060
yeah the lines grown okay so what does

1542
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,670
change the difference is that we're

1543
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,350
doing DNS per application or DNS per

1544
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,070
protocol

1545
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:19,170
differences and that's actually quite

1546
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,250
different than existing stuff so I'm

1547
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:23,219
gonna run through my list of six

1548
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:25,110
questions without commentary does the

1549
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:26,880
IETF need this to be standardized Azure

1550
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:29,639
a point of standardization does this

1551
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,110
promote alternate nades namespaces I can

1552
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,270
currently has on this on there were e

1553
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:35,280
deck do we care that we're promoting a

1554
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:37,860
per protocol or per application solution

1555
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:41,160
we get caught in the tussle a lot of

1556
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:43,199
encrypted data center like let's get

1557
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:46,749
that one oh right

1558
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:48,280
so it boils down to what's the benefit

1559
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:49,780
of standardizing this and if we were

1560
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,489
going to re architecture things today

1561
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:52,929
would we actually pick dough or are we

1562
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:54,820
using dough as an end-run around

1563
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:56,260
existing network problems and

1564
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,549
operational problems that maybe we'd

1565
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:03,459
solve a different way if we had had a

1566
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:05,349
choice we're gonna alternate between all

1567
01:12:03,459 --> 01:12:08,829
right imperil I have 57 different things

1568
01:12:05,349 --> 01:12:11,019
to say so in terms of what to do I think

1569
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:14,739
there's very some parts of this or work

1570
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:17,769
to be done in the ITF I think I can't

1571
01:12:14,739 --> 01:12:19,268
see a sane way to split that up into

1572
01:12:17,769 --> 01:12:22,530
multiple working groups that makes any

1573
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:24,400
sense to me anyway maybe it exists I

1574
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:28,329
personally I think it was a mistake to

1575
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:30,219
charter deprived endo separately so my

1576
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:31,570
kind of suggestion would are something

1577
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:34,289
to think about would be to put all of

1578
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:37,808
this into one working group to look at

1579
01:12:34,289 --> 01:12:41,199
DNS privacy and through an application

1580
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:44,670
sitting there at DNS and the protocol

1581
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:46,869
and operations things that surround that

1582
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:48,010
you say one or two things very quickly

1583
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:49,630
that you think would be

1584
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:51,880
non-controversial that you would see of

1585
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:53,769
thinking forward and so I think the

1586
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,320
split DNS if there's any protocol

1587
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:57,670
mechanism is there I think any

1588
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,340
performance kind of measurement type

1589
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:03,820
work seems to be reasonable the

1590
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:10,570
discovery of Java versus 53 versus

1591
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:15,190
though thank you John Porter actually

1592
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:18,280
clarification question for David so you

1593
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:19,989
mentioned that the information that you

1594
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,259
should use a particular DHS over for

1595
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:24,518
practical the domain should be keyed to

1596
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:27,610
whatever identifies me so it doesn't

1597
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:29,829
turn into a super cookie that does imply

1598
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:32,860
that this caching is extremely limited

1599
01:13:29,829 --> 01:13:36,249
in its use right so probably only

1600
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:37,449
refreshed connections to the same CDN or

1601
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:40,929
something where you might want to ask

1602
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:42,489
the CDN to refresh sorry we have to slow

1603
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:43,869
for clarification questions we want to

1604
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:45,218
talk about the big picture now I'm

1605
01:13:43,869 --> 01:13:48,518
talking yeah so their contract whatever

1606
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:52,150
I am arriving at the point so the thing

1607
01:13:48,519 --> 01:13:54,639
is that the end result is you're you're

1608
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:55,839
never gonna have a destination specified

1609
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,969
toh server for the

1610
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,920
initial connection so you're just not

1611
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:01,659
gonna remember it for long enough so

1612
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,330
that that pushes me down the direction

1613
01:14:01,659 --> 01:14:06,400
of the th server or Quixote's or

1614
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:07,809
whatever it's gonna be specified by the

1615
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,110
network still like we are doing

1616
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:15,460
currently in the end that is why we're

1617
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:17,799
that the path leads me down to Phil ham

1618
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:20,550
Baker it strikes me that this discussion

1619
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:23,739
is has been technology led and the

1620
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:26,949
technology is DNS and for me the problem

1621
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:30,369
is establishing a connection with a

1622
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:33,009
website or other site in the face of an

1623
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:33,759
adversary who's trying to interfere with

1624
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,580
that connection

1625
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:39,550
if you know Kazakhstan's currently man

1626
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:43,150
in the middling the entire country on

1627
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:44,349
TLS and so when we look at these things

1628
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:47,259
I think that we've got to look at the

1629
01:14:44,349 --> 01:14:49,330
gestalt because if you're trying to

1630
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:52,030
commit that connection and you've got a

1631
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:54,809
runaround for doing the DNS you should

1632
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:58,179
be thinking about how you do the TLS

1633
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:59,770
certificate at the same time because if

1634
01:14:58,179 --> 01:15:02,440
you don't then you're going to end up

1635
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:05,590
with two technologies to do a workaround

1636
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:08,199
and two points of vulnerability and at

1637
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:12,310
the moment in the ITF you've got doe and

1638
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:14,379
deprive and multiple DNS focus groups I

1639
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:18,210
think that if you were to charter a new

1640
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:21,489
group you should very fine to have tech

1641
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:25,119
groups focused on one technology but at

1642
01:15:21,489 --> 01:15:31,388
the moment to add a fourth group to dns

1643
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:33,150
alone I think would it be a mistake this

1644
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:35,650
is not what this was about this was

1645
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:37,059
specifically about a technical scrub

1646
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:39,339
along the protocols that were mentioned

1647
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:42,489
yeah but you're trying to solve a

1648
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:44,080
problem and if you're trying to solve a

1649
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:52,989
problems like you want to ask for a

1650
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:56,739
different Bowl yeah run for a sec if

1651
01:15:52,989 --> 01:15:57,940
you're going to progress this the one

1652
01:15:56,739 --> 01:16:00,428
thing that I missed in in the

1653
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:02,739
discussions so it popped up this fetid

1654
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:04,690
list of trusted resolvers right how is

1655
01:16:02,739 --> 01:16:06,190
that list composed that at least shoot

1656
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,190
somehow be the subject of a draft

1657
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:11,790
because if that turns into a cabal of

1658
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:14,349
the cup for that takes away a lot of

1659
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:16,600
control from users right now if I want

1660
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:18,190
to change my DNS as a user there are a

1661
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,170
handful of operating systems and I can

1662
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:21,849
work I'd have to change that if every

1663
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:23,470
application does that and comes with its

1664
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:24,940
own list and there is no control

1665
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:27,550
whatsoever over how that list is

1666
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:28,030
composed what does that mean for me as a

1667
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:30,880
user

1668
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:32,950
because basically all of the I I lose

1669
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,150
control rather than gain privacy and I

1670
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:36,309
think that it is something that isn't

1671
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:39,540
getting discussed enough and should at

1672
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:41,800
least be in scope for this kind of work

1673
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:46,120
picker Heine

1674
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:48,580
nervous : so I mean this is like AI like

1675
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:50,320
that bulleted list if it's very long I

1676
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:52,120
think there's some interesting things to

1677
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,790
work on hiding in that list and some

1678
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,410
things we should not take to work on the

1679
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:59,350
interesting things to work on um I think

1680
01:16:56,410 --> 01:17:01,930
are the work on performance measurement

1681
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:04,390
and performance analysis and importance

1682
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:05,710
cetera of these deluge technologies and

1683
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:07,270
those are quite interesting in our in

1684
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:08,860
our debut talk yet um yesterday about

1685
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:10,570
this so I think that something which has

1686
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:12,910
an interesting results um if you haven't

1687
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:15,070
seen that we've brought the kind of

1688
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:18,010
thing won't only take in - um I think

1689
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:21,219
discovery of the sort of behavior local

1690
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:23,350
network um is interesting topic as I

1691
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:25,210
think and you go overhead graphing this

1692
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:26,710
and more and alluded to um you know in

1693
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:28,420
the current environment TNS economies

1694
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:29,980
control point and having the application

1695
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:31,810
be able to detect that at least for now

1696
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:35,019
and deal with it is something which like

1697
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:37,660
the German interest the short term um I

1698
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:40,080
think the things that I think are not

1699
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:43,900
going to be helpful to worker are the

1700
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:47,680
the validity or goodness or badness of

1701
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:50,290
the applications opting to choose our

1702
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,670
own DNS resolvers and tell into them of

1703
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,710
the users being able to discern Janus

1704
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:56,530
resolvers um without the network's help

1705
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:58,510
or conversely the network interfering

1706
01:17:56,530 --> 01:18:01,179
with the users dance revolution um those

1707
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:01,870
are things which will on not have good

1708
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,130
outcomes

1709
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:05,170
um as you I think you'll see by the

1710
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:07,150
large amount of heat generated both here

1711
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:08,320
and last time so I was true it seems

1712
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:10,059
like there's plenty of good work to do

1713
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,710
but braiding off bad work which will

1714
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,790
just cause a lot of pain and not have

1715
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:19,480
consensus it's not something good thing

1716
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:20,920
to do Roberto Roberto pay on first of

1717
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:24,299
all the great thing about DNS is there's

1718
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,300
never a correct answer for anything

1719
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:29,260
and you know let that sink in because

1720
01:18:27,519 --> 01:18:31,090
it's it's gonna be true of any of the

1721
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:34,619
things that we decide including where we

1722
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:38,110
put this but I have a question however

1723
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:39,759
which is there seem to be a lot of

1724
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:41,380
parallels with the discussion going on

1725
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,050
here and discussions that were happening

1726
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:46,630
around the time when we were looking to

1727
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:49,510
standardize http/2 in particular around

1728
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:51,039
having requirements on TLS and what that

1729
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,999
was going to do to intermediaries and

1730
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:54,699
look at what that was going to do

1731
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:56,199
network operators and I think it's

1732
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:57,669
probably worthwhile to think back on

1733
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,869
those times I know that's you know

1734
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,699
learning from history is sometimes

1735
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:02,230
things we avoid but there might be some

1736
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:04,509
history we can learn from here in terms

1737
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:08,549
of how this might actually attack things

1738
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:08,550
oh just a reminder thanks

1739
01:19:10,019 --> 01:19:16,119
so I am in favor of having a working

1740
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:18,969
group I don't know if it belongs in art

1741
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:21,339
I was you know I don't know if it's also

1742
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:23,590
UPS because we have v6 UPS which elseís

1743
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:26,349
helps us address operational issues

1744
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:27,969
around the ipv6 deployment and maybe

1745
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:29,679
that would be something but in any case

1746
01:19:27,969 --> 01:19:31,869
we really do need a working group

1747
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:34,690
because we need to address the network

1748
01:19:31,869 --> 01:19:36,759
operational issues that come about from

1749
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:40,419
this because what we're hearing you know

1750
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:42,820
if I look at Martin's slides is you know

1751
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:47,829
we're going to be turning this default

1752
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:49,690
on and therefore obviating the users

1753
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:51,730
choice and taking place of the users

1754
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:53,348
choice the user chose to download us and

1755
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:54,489
we'll make all other choices for them

1756
01:19:53,349 --> 01:19:58,960
but that's beside the point

1757
01:19:54,489 --> 01:20:01,119
um that's not a correct and summary of

1758
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,769
what martin said we need I do understand

1759
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:05,469
your point but that was not what magnify

1760
01:20:02,769 --> 01:20:06,909
we need to discuss the operational

1761
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:09,369
issues we need to have a working group

1762
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:11,110
where we can do this and we need to

1763
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:15,909
really get started on the discussion of

1764
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:18,549
the Charter as soon as possible Yaya

1765
01:20:15,909 --> 01:20:21,009
Eriksson so um I have two points the

1766
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:23,260
first point is that I would like to see

1767
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:25,150
a working group addresses the

1768
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:27,550
operational issues and obviously we have

1769
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:30,339
some work to do to narrow down what what

1770
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:33,329
that exact list of issues is but we we

1771
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:36,700
would like to have a working group and

1772
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:38,530
the other point is that there's

1773
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:40,740
actually several issues that enemy sort

1774
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:43,570
of always seem to be focused on some

1775
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:45,670
some aspect of that and obviously seeing

1776
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:47,259
the full full picture so we've had lots

1777
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:50,970
of discussion today on like DNS

1778
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:54,070
filtering and and spookiness and

1779
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:56,020
blocking and and so forth and you know I

1780
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:58,809
have some views about that topic it's

1781
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:00,640
not you know basically a hook topic for

1782
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:02,350
me but it seems to be for a lot of the

1783
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:06,490
crowd here and a lot of discussion but

1784
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:10,060
but there are other things so I think

1785
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:12,400
like the concept of centralized DNS and

1786
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:15,640
like applications that would have a

1787
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:17,889
small set of places that they call home

1788
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,530
every time a user does something does

1789
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:22,570
scare me a lot and you know it has its

1790
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:26,380
wide open for surveillance and other

1791
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:28,870
reasons for for all kinds of bad things

1792
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:31,630
to happen so I don't think we should to

1793
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:33,760
go there that's potentially another

1794
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:37,330
thing that we could have recommendations

1795
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:40,560
on that don't have this like one view

1796
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:43,360
over the world default thing if you can

1797
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:46,170
spread things to many different places

1798
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:48,610
that that's great but if if we are

1799
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:50,440
centralizing whatever is today in 10

1800
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:53,080
million different DNS servers locally

1801
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,490
into a few things in the world that's a

1802
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,380
very bad outcome for the infinite I

1803
01:21:54,490 --> 01:22:03,099
think the IDF's would say that's not a

1804
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:04,540
good good model thank you just just a

1805
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,130
quick note there are like 10 people

1806
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:07,769
queued and less than 10 minutes left so

1807
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:10,780
mines are closed

1808
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:13,810
Leslie Nagel first I would like to say

1809
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:15,700
thank you Jim Reed for the second

1810
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:18,190
presentation I'm not thankful for the

1811
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:19,990
first because I do you think those his

1812
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:22,210
points there were ones that actually do

1813
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:24,790
need to be articulated consciously that

1814
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:26,410
it may be inherently assumed as given in

1815
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:29,470
some minds and I think it's not in

1816
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:31,570
others what I'm hearing in a lot of this

1817
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:35,350
discussion is actually a call for

1818
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:37,139
applications are calling for different

1819
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:41,200
functionality in the internet naming

1820
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:43,270
system I think that is therefore wrong

1821
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:45,370
to talk about it in terms specifically

1822
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:47,680
of the DNS and what it says to our

1823
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:49,849
conceptions of DNS and what we can do

1824
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,919
did the DA's going forward and

1825
01:22:49,849 --> 01:22:54,679
this is actually an architectural

1826
01:22:51,919 --> 01:22:56,599
problem and I think it should be

1827
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:59,510
addressed as an architectural problem as

1828
01:22:56,599 --> 01:23:00,919
it stands I think there's a first order

1829
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:02,030
of business would be to define what is

1830
01:23:00,919 --> 01:23:06,039
it that we actually mean by an

1831
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:09,369
application today because as described

1832
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:11,898
Mozilla becomes Annapolis service

1833
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:13,219
because it's no longer the case that you

1834
01:23:11,899 --> 01:23:14,449
have your application running on your

1835
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:17,300
machine and you have your network

1836
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:19,219
configured but in fact your network may

1837
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,379
be functioning fine your application

1838
01:23:19,219 --> 01:23:23,599
will stop working because of some

1839
01:23:21,379 --> 01:23:26,689
configuration deep in its bowels where

1840
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:28,189
it relies on the internet for doing go

1841
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:30,530
and you have no idea what the heck is

1842
01:23:28,189 --> 01:23:34,039
going on I realize that that is hardly

1843
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:35,268
unique to that particular aspect it's

1844
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:37,249
hardly unique to Mozilla

1845
01:23:35,269 --> 01:23:39,409
it's hardly unique to this particular

1846
01:23:37,249 --> 01:23:39,889
case of dough our phones do it all the

1847
01:23:39,409 --> 01:23:42,049
time

1848
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:44,449
which is why I think it's worth stopping

1849
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:46,519
and having the architectural question of

1850
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:48,530
first of all what is an application what

1851
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:50,389
is the service what is a naming system

1852
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:55,340
and that we think is actually useful and

1853
01:23:50,389 --> 01:23:58,039
usable in today's Internet Benkei duck I

1854
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:00,349
like both unless these points wrench

1855
01:23:58,039 --> 01:24:02,419
insert from the first and Jim's second

1856
01:24:00,349 --> 01:24:04,489
talk in terms of concrete work items

1857
01:24:02,419 --> 01:24:08,209
that might come out so we're writing

1858
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:10,369
down what has up to now open assumably

1859
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:12,289
shared assumptions that have not

1860
01:24:10,369 --> 01:24:16,608
previously written down it seems useful

1861
01:24:12,289 --> 01:24:18,438
you know use the IANA route look ISP has

1862
01:24:16,609 --> 01:24:22,849
knowledge about how to make your local

1863
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:25,099
ISP work well that's her thing Eric

1864
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:26,599
Cline I was just two points when I was

1865
01:24:25,099 --> 01:24:28,429
going to agree with Lorenzo earlier it's

1866
01:24:26,599 --> 01:24:30,079
the an operating system can do this on

1867
01:24:28,429 --> 01:24:31,639
behalf of all applications without the

1868
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:32,929
applications knowledge so if you want to

1869
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:36,699
keep the same acronym I would offer that

1870
01:24:32,929 --> 01:24:39,229
it's avoiding designated DNS and

1871
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:40,398
secondly I also agreed with them Leslie

1872
01:24:39,229 --> 01:24:42,349
I was wondering whether or not the kind

1873
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:45,739
of thing that comes out of this isn't

1874
01:24:42,349 --> 01:24:49,639
going to be an IAB Mar new report style

1875
01:24:45,739 --> 01:24:50,358
document given that so much of what

1876
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:52,939
needs to be said

1877
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:54,949
maybe non-technical or just sort of

1878
01:24:52,939 --> 01:24:59,420
reporting very hard to take a stance on

1879
01:24:54,949 --> 01:25:03,099
some of this bad Schwartz

1880
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:06,860
so I've heard a lot of concerns about

1881
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:08,560
DNS related operational issues we have a

1882
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:12,980
working group for DNS related

1883
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:14,990
operational issues in DNS ah so I think

1884
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:17,719
that we should take those issues and

1885
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:19,370
send them to be in SL I do think if you

1886
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,140
spend some time in DNS op recently you

1887
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:22,910
might notice that it does not affect

1888
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:27,020
seem to spend a lot of time on DNS

1889
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:29,110
related operational issues it is acting

1890
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:32,290
as the DNS working group and

1891
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:35,330
standardizing actual protocol related

1892
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:38,150
technical matters in in the DNS and

1893
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:39,890
that's important work but I think that

1894
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:42,230
you know it may be time to do a little

1895
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:43,720
bit of a refactor on our various DNS

1896
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:46,400
related groups I could certainly imagine

1897
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,740
ultimately having a DNS group that

1898
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,900
handles both what most of what's in

1899
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:53,210
Viana soft and deprived until which are

1900
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:55,219
all essentially technical DNS related

1901
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:56,780
questions and a DNS up working group

1902
01:25:55,220 --> 01:26:01,460
which is in fact focused on ensuring

1903
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:03,500
that DMS operators are are sharing best

1904
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:05,440
practices and able to implement those

1905
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,510
specifications

1906
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,860
Daniel Kahn Gilmore ACLU I do think that

1907
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,990
there's work that needs to be done here

1908
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:13,190
I think I'm in agreement with then and

1909
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:15,260
with what Stephen said earlier about

1910
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:16,519
trying to merge together some of the

1911
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:20,030
different places where this conversation

1912
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,850
is happening in the ITF I think that the

1913
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:24,860
most critical thing where multiple

1914
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:27,830
presentations have kind of maybe even

1915
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:31,960
disagreed with themselves today has to

1916
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:35,120
do with questions about what it means to

1917
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:37,490
give the to continue to give the user

1918
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,349
some level of control here the network

1919
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:41,599
wants to enforce their will on the user

1920
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:42,740
the application wants to enforce their

1921
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,020
will on the user the operating system

1922
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:46,490
wants to enforce their will on the user

1923
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:47,930
we know that we can't give the user the

1924
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,519
choice because no user wants to make

1925
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:50,930
this choice there's a fundamental

1926
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,990
problem there we don't talk about that

1927
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:55,250
here at the ITF and so I don't know how

1928
01:26:53,990 --> 01:27:00,500
we grapple with it but that seems like

1929
01:26:55,250 --> 01:27:01,970
what's missing John Reed Akamai I don't

1930
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,400
think repair Braille to say what he said

1931
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:05,780
but secondly I think I've heard an

1932
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,799
argument in favor of another working

1933
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,179
group for this which is every time

1934
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,190
somebody says well the protocol is not

1935
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,960
evil the protocols not a problem it's

1936
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:13,139
the use of it great then we need to

1937
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,120
separate those do you things and I

1938
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:17,210
we have dealt with protocol we have that

1939
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:20,040
working group need another one

1940
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:23,610
everything else in sorry but we had

1941
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:26,070
close to lunch bit behind you miserable

1942
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:27,750
dollar from open exchange and it's DNS

1943
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:30,090
software implementers and recursive

1944
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:31,620
operators I think that all the

1945
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:34,380
operational concerns that have been

1946
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:38,880
shown pretty real so please let's have a

1947
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:41,250
place where we can discuss or whatever

1948
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,800
and especially please let's have a group

1949
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:46,890
in which we all meet because I feel that

1950
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,690
part of the problem in a way is that I

1951
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:53,400
mean part of the community was going in

1952
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:56,490
one direction now it's really time that

1953
01:27:53,400 --> 01:28:04,889
we to agree on the way forward and find

1954
01:27:56,490 --> 01:28:06,540
wasted from the user point of view that

1955
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:09,180
reminds me a little name please

1956
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:11,460
Vasily do notice from user point of view

1957
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:15,180
that reminds me a lot a checklist novel

1958
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:19,140
watch board so we are trying to wait

1959
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:21,950
from some control on DNS servers and we

1960
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:25,230
are inventing in our control point and

1961
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:27,630
then we hand the control to the

1962
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:31,169
application developer all the website

1963
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:36,600
owner which is even not network

1964
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:40,800
operators so I really doubt that it is

1965
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:43,640
better choice for me as we use it to

1966
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,740
handle the control to those groups

1967
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:51,770
moreover I have heard here that they

1968
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:56,580
decided which list of DNS servers to use

1969
01:28:51,770 --> 01:29:00,930
not me not my network operator but the

1970
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:03,780
application developers so really I can

1971
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:06,870
predict that their wide implementation

1972
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:10,460
of this technology will lead to

1973
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:14,390
separation the internet in the several

1974
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:19,610
application centric universes so they

1975
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:23,400
will be totally incompatible because

1976
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:26,848
different application developers will

1977
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:30,839
decide on different set of a servers

1978
01:29:26,849 --> 01:29:33,179
and they have quite a huge experience on

1979
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:36,500
tweaking vehicle formation and trekking

1980
01:29:33,179 --> 01:29:40,770
very informational me as a user

1981
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:43,949
really I was very glad to see these

1982
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:47,460
discussion open but I cannot imagine

1983
01:29:43,949 --> 01:29:55,489
what deliverables would this working

1984
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:59,010
group make thank you time that right

1985
01:29:55,489 --> 01:30:02,549
Erica scroll a few few points

1986
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:05,699
thank I um as I said earlier I think you

1987
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:07,909
know DP there is um I think a wide

1988
01:30:05,699 --> 01:30:10,110
divergence of opinions about what the

1989
01:30:07,909 --> 01:30:12,540
appropriate place the application is in

1990
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:14,759
this system I don't see that gap closing

1991
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,469
um ITF does not handle the situation

1992
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,239
well and the idea that like a working

1993
01:30:16,469 --> 01:30:20,159
group will somehow resolve the consensus

1994
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:22,019
statement about like being merits or

1995
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:23,699
demerits of an application or network

1996
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:25,199
control and the TNS like strikes me this

1997
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:26,489
extreme events of well um what will

1998
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,019
happen is wish but endless amount of

1999
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:30,000
time the goosh eaten in this blot land

2000
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:33,780
possible text that seems not not useful

2001
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,880
um as I said there's useful to do um but

2002
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:38,759
I said I wanted to make two subjective

2003
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,800
points on the first is that um we're

2004
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,510
talking about selection of at motion

2005
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,190
audience question defaults currently

2006
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,900
default that everything has whatever

2007
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:47,129
network offer to you um and now we're

2008
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,290
talking about the application choose any

2009
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:50,730
different at fault um I can't speak for

2010
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,260
Chrome but I can tell you that Firefox

2011
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:53,909
perfectly well allows you to enter any

2012
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:56,880
doe resolver of your choice or turn off

2013
01:30:53,909 --> 01:30:58,290
doe and will continue to do so even if

2014
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,110
we pick it even if we turn on all button

2015
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:04,500
so um so user will have that appropriate

2016
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:06,000
oh their own choice um we will have a

2017
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,619
set of people that we have verified

2018
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,699
comply with our policies but I will not

2019
01:31:07,619 --> 01:31:11,519
preclude these are from doing their own

2020
01:31:08,699 --> 01:31:13,530
thing um the second thing is a little

2021
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,719
surprised to hear on any of this

2022
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:17,099
characterized as like as like the

2023
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:19,050
application is tracing out the users

2024
01:31:17,099 --> 01:31:20,940
choice like the user doesn't know what

2025
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:22,469
DNS is there's no idea that network is

2026
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:24,329
offering them a resolver and the idea

2027
01:31:22,469 --> 01:31:25,590
these are likes it like to opted like

2028
01:31:24,329 --> 01:31:28,170
have like the what

2029
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:29,550
ihe fy5 do their dns resolution in some

2030
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:31,199
like informed consent way I mean it's

2031
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:33,659
just not does not track what's actually

2032
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,888
going on here so um you may not think

2033
01:31:33,659 --> 01:31:36,388
it's good for application make decision

2034
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:38,040
then that repeats decision but the idea

2035
01:31:36,389 --> 01:31:39,630
is it like we're taking the choice out

2036
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:44,640
of the users hands

2037
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:46,890
I think about sham or that so it is

2038
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,940
clear that we need some more time but I

2039
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:49,530
think actually some progress was made

2040
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,849
right I think Lorenzo had a pretty

2041
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:52,320
interesting observation that some of

2042
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:54,090
these issues are not actually they're

2043
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:57,210
not related but not actually related to

2044
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:59,580
choosing non-traditional resolution

2045
01:31:57,210 --> 01:32:00,960
points and and maybe thinking through

2046
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:02,580
some of the points that were made today

2047
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,800
in doing the talks along those lines

2048
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:07,019
might further tease them apart and maybe

2049
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,190
we can sort of divide and conquer parts

2050
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,420
of the area a little bit better by

2051
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:11,219
trying to understand what actually

2052
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:13,500
causes the problems that people are

2053
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:15,870
seeing in operations but also their

2054
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:18,240
shipping applications um I know barrier

2055
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:20,370
has any final thoughts for that the area

2056
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:22,139
director that whose charges or various

2057
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:26,160
oh you're the mic excellent at the mic

2058
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:27,720
just just one thing this is Barry there

2059
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,220
was a lot of stuff presented today a lot

2060
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,540
of stuff discussed with microphones I

2061
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:32,910
don't want to try to tease any of that

2062
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:35,790
apart now so the one simple question I

2063
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:37,950
just want to ask is does anybody think

2064
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:41,250
that there's nothing that was discussed

2065
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:45,830
today that we should work on if so hum

2066
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:48,630
Napoli's okay we do have a significant

2067
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:51,900
sense that we don't want to work on any

2068
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:53,430
of this so we could take this back to

2069
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:55,830
the ad showed us as the opposite

2070
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:57,570
question though this is whoever thinks

2071
01:32:55,830 --> 01:33:00,019
that something here is worthy do we work

2072
01:32:57,570 --> 01:33:01,469
untruth hopefully some no well otherwise

2073
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,940
okay

2074
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:04,410
if you think there's something that

2075
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,980
would that came up today that should be

2076
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:09,990
worked on hum yeah I mean I heard that

2077
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:12,120
at the mic as well we didn't really need

2078
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:14,280
it so let's take this back to the ad D

2079
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:16,860
list and discuss I would like the people

2080
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:19,650
who hum saying there's nothing here that

2081
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:21,540
should be worked on to think about what

2082
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:23,280
you want to post to the list about why

2083
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:24,240
you don't think we should work on this

2084
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,400
because I think that'll be an

2085
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,469
interesting start to further discussion

2086
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:36,920
and you can decide on a grant Lucie a

2087
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:40,140
minute behind you your show Lucie Lynch

2088
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:42,390
that hub doesn't work for me because the

2089
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:44,430
stuff I would like to work on his stuff

2090
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:46,760
that was said at mic not in

2091
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:49,980
presentations I think there is a

2092
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:52,140
fundamental question here between should

2093
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:53,450
we do this and how do we do this and how

2094
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:55,130
do we do this

2095
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:58,519
voices have been very loud in the room

2096
01:33:55,130 --> 01:34:00,830
but yari Leslie dkg several other people

2097
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:03,680
at the mic or the should we do this

2098
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:10,880
voices that's the IAB question not the

2099
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:12,920
IES chicas yes les mary did you have one

2100
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,260
quick thing when I said discussed today

2101
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:18,500
I included what was discussed at the mic

2102
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:21,110
why not just right so we'll pursue it on

2103
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:23,030
the ADB at IETF mailing list blue sheets

2104
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:24,830
please if you haven't signed it do sign

2105
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:26,509
and we'll meet them up front and lastly

2106
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:29,809
I just wanted to thank you all for a

2107
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:33,010
very respective respectful conversation

2108
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:33,010
that we had today so thank you
