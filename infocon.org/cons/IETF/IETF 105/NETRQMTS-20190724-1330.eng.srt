1
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:51,530
nobody it's not over but it is only 1:30

2
00:00:46,309 --> 00:01:03,319
right it is exactly time to start yes it

3
00:00:51,530 --> 00:01:05,180
is time to start okay as has been so as

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,460
has been so gently pointed out it is

5
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,080
time to start it's the person walking in

6
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,779
the back that can you close the door for

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:20,840
me thank you

8
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:22,850
wow that's loud there's what there's

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,410
room up front yeah that is true I see

10
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:37,460
the people sitting at the very back I

11
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:38,050
see you okay so we have distribute blue

12
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,369
sheets

13
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,820
did we get a minute taker right yeah

14
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:49,670
yeah

15
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:52,039
do we have a minute taker it's always

16
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:56,200
not pretty when chairs have to beg for a

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:01,240
minute takers minute taker oh I I have

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,240
excellent so we have Martin and Laura Oh

19
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,960
jabber scribe did you do it in the ease

20
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,960
of Pat please

21
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:19,430
okay he's jabber scribe Thank You Joel

22
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:37,620
okay so with that okay

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,390
so is there anybody in this room that

24
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,690
has not seen this slide at least once

25
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,179
this week okay this is the IHF note well

26
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:59,550
this is an IETF meeting all of the rules

27
00:02:45,180 --> 00:03:03,480
of the IETF apply and this is our

28
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:14,520
planned agenda for today is there in the

29
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:16,980
agenda bashing nope excellent so first

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,210
on the agenda is yeah that's the end of

31
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,209
the slide we need for the other deck

32
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:51,830
use the podium you could grab it no how

33
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,960
about now excellent okay the other thing

34
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,390
two things before I get started putting

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,830
my chair hat back on I'd like to remind

36
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,019
remote participants that there is a

37
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,730
virtual queue and they can get in it and

38
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,280
to put questions in the jabberin

39
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,980
appreciated by the word mic that would

40
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,900
be helpful and then the second thing

41
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:17,029
personal bit of administrivia while I am

42
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,989
just so I am employed by the Internet

43
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:22,340
Society in this context I am

44
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,320
representing the NOC team as somebody

45
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,820
who's been on the NOC team for more

46
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,610
years and I care to admit sometimes so

47
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:35,150
none of this is in any way the Internet

48
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,220
Society Karen thank you for your many

49
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,030
years of participation in the NOC

50
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:46,340
including long before you became an

51
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:49,219
employee of the Internet Society these

52
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,859
days I think I'm mostly anyway so

53
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,940
basically the objective of this bop and

54
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,280
we'll talk a little bit more about how

55
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,230
we got to this stage but was to gather

56
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,059
community input on the network because

57
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,620
you know we've been building this

58
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,330
network and it's evolved a lot over time

59
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,970
the last time we really had a serious

60
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:09,140
requirements discussion was about ten

61
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,280
years ago and we developed the

62
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,539
beginnings of a requirements document

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,940
that's up on the website and we haven't

64
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,240
really revisited it since then and in

65
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,790
Prague we had sort of a a knock retreat

66
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,780
where we got together and we said well

67
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,140
they're all of these trade offs that

68
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,789
we're trying to make as a team and it's

69
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,039
difficult to make those those trade offs

70
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,300
without understanding what the community

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,310
really wants because of course

72
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,460
everything comes everything is a

73
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,169
balancing act between you know

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,280
complexity and functionality simplicity

75
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:45,080
cost resourcing and so we wanted to get

76
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,690
to gather some feedback from you all

77
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,558
I'm what your expectations were and how

78
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,409
much you are willing to

79
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:56,369
put up with so this is that's the whole

80
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:58,139
point of this Boff the one thing I did

81
00:05:56,369 --> 00:06:00,419
want to talk briefly about was basically

82
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,489
the how we got here how is this network

83
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:07,948
been built over the years

84
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:09,779
and if you go back to when in in the

85
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,429
early days I was going to add the dates

86
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,929
in here that I never actually did that

87
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:15,268
but years and years ago the network was

88
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:17,518
provided basically by the hosts and so

89
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:20,309
every IETF meeting had a host the

90
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:25,469
responsibility of the host was to build

91
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:27,179
the network for that and and provide a

92
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,558
terminal room and in those days the term

93
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:32,518
alone was a really big deal because we

94
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:34,109
had lots of actual terminals and and it

95
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,619
was sort of a point to a certain extent

96
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:39,448
a point of pride for the hosts but then

97
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:42,089
what you get into and that sort of a

98
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,889
model is it's a one-shot deal each time

99
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:48,859
for the host and so every host is coming

100
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:51,719
in it's a big risk item and it is a

101
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:55,399
there's not a ton of benefit to that and

102
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:57,989
people that you know build and deploy

103
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,309
venue types of networks or event types

104
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:01,198
of networks those networks are a little

105
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,849
bit different than your average

106
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,079
enterprise network it has a different

107
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,998
sort of concet of constraints a

108
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,499
different way that you build it and so

109
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:13,169
over the years some volunteers basically

110
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:15,149
started advising the host team and so

111
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,459
you saw some of the same you know the

112
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:20,789
network team being the host and the host

113
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:26,249
equipment supplemented by some number of

114
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:28,349
volunteers and then over time as there

115
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:30,569
was a period of time there were the IHF

116
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,829
struggled to get hosts even and the

117
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,379
hosts that they could get were not

118
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:35,999
really interested in the risk and the

119
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,709
cost associated with deploying the

120
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:41,159
network and so it became a volunteer

121
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:43,679
only team was scrounged gear and what

122
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:47,279
this actually means is we would you know

123
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:50,008
before any event before any i upcoming

124
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,769
IETF we would have to go and see if we

125
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,479
could beg borrow or steal gear get

126
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,589
shipped in to wherever we were going to

127
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,149
be and we would start building the

128
00:07:55,589 --> 00:08:03,030
network on-site and this had burying

129
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:09,840
levels of success over time

130
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:11,309
and so roughly I don't have ten twelve

131
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,190
years ago I don't remember exactly how

132
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,810
long ago we had two major things that

133
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,270
change first of all we got some major

134
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,660
equipment donations and the second thing

135
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:24,330
was is we started contracting out a lot

136
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,960
of the the deployment of the network

137
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,450
itself

138
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,680
so then the model was that you had

139
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:35,280
volunteer team with contractor support

140
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,140
and also donated gear and the band

141
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,000
obviously the advantage of donated gear

142
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,710
was you're using the same equipment from

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,780
meeting to meeting and so you develop

144
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,130
some expertise in that you get somewhat

145
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,270
you know you start developing some tools

146
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,130
for how you manage that going forward

147
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,750
and then a few years ago you know we had

148
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,620
a meeting that kind of went sideways and

149
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:59,100
we we did a little bit of introspection

150
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,360
and we decided that you know that this

151
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,910
network has gotten big enough and

152
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,380
complex enough and operational enough

153
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:09,510
that we want to look at staging and more

154
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,460
standardized operational practices so we

155
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,430
moved to a model of the volunteer

156
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,110
contractor team with advanced staging so

157
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,160
now this set of gear that we have gets

158
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,500
shipped back to Portland

159
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,900
you know our racket sets up and

160
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,220
maintenance is done between time between

161
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:29,939
events and testing is done some

162
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,740
development is done and also we built a

163
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,010
whole set of management tools and a

164
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,860
whole set of tools for configuring

165
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,600
devices and we you know operationalized

166
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,880
a lot of that and use a lot of best

167
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,400
practices so the model has changed over

168
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,160
time and and the resourcing required to

169
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,370
do that and because the other side of

170
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,560
this being that the team is not just

171
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:56,550
what's what's contracted it's it's a

172
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,170
real blended team of people from the

173
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,520
various numbers of organizations and

174
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,829
trying to make sure everybody gets the

175
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,689
support they need so that's basically

176
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,160
the administrative side of how the

177
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:10,470
network is built and then the next thing

178
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,810
I want to talk about briefly was

179
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,940
documenting requirements so there is a

180
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,540
draft on network requirements that was

181
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,770
posted in consult in

182
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,449
association with this and so where that

183
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,890
draft is right now we're not going to go

184
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,850
into a lot of details on that because we

185
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:31,100
have a list of specific questions but

186
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:32,420
basically the this is a danger with

187
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,370
notifications they come and you know

188
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,130
don't really month I mean it's have a

189
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,720
hard time ignoring them so there's

190
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,250
basically the the network requirements

191
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,820
document has three sets of target

192
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:46,430
audiences one is the external provider

193
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,810
so it's you know what speed of the links

194
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,520
whether the quality of the links that we

195
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,819
need to be in how many do we need to

196
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,529
bring in for an event how many how many

197
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,480
do we bring in what kind of diversity

198
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,600
they have so that's all about what

199
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,520
networks we bring in the second set of

200
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,290
requirements are really about venue

201
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,020
selection you know what do we need in a

202
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,819
venue what are the characteristics what

203
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,140
types of access do we need to the venue

204
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,690
in order to be able to build the network

205
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,069
that we want to build and what you know

206
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,649
what kind of relationship do we have

207
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,200
with the venue itself and then the third

208
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:20,810
set of requirements are basically

209
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,589
targeted at the network designers so the

210
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,609
NOC so what kind of network do we plan

211
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,959
to deploy and what are the

212
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:32,750
characteristics of that network so draft

213
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:37,699
zero zero was basically the current set

214
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:40,310
of the currently documented set of

215
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,760
requirements which goes back nine or ten

216
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,829
years now it's not what we do actually

217
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,060
draft zero one is an update that

218
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,330
represents some of what we do actually

219
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:54,079
but not all of it and so we're we're

220
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:57,850
going to go from here today is worn it's

221
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,850
going to come up and tell you all about

222
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:03,230
we wonder why you Warren's gonna come up

223
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,360
and tell you all about the network that

224
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,890
we built here and then Russ and I will

225
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,690
go through some specific sets of

226
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,040
questions that we wanted to get I'm

227
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,329
going to say this again when we get to

228
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,589
the questions but I really want to

229
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,739
emphasize that what we're looking for

230
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,000
here is user feedback and what what

231
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:24,380
we're not really looking for at this

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:27,680
stage is designing a network so so as

233
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,720
you're listening to this presentation I

234
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,180
think

235
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,990
some things to keep in the back of your

236
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:39,189
mind or what does the network need to be

237
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:48,210
for you to have a productive meeting get

238
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:51,040
all aspects of your work done so started

239
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:54,490
so yeah as Russ said you know we want

240
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,469
some feedback on how the network works

241
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,270
for you the mode if you provide that

242
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,980
it's probably helpful for you to know at

243
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,670
what we actually do currently and how we

244
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,700
build it and what will we provide

245
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:09,849
pointed to your face better Wow finally

246
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,480
have to lift the microphone listen so

247
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,920
we're going on an adventure

248
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,460
if folk would like to follow along and

249
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,010
there are some stats dash board meeting

250
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,050
dot IETF dog has some Network stats

251
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,130
you're free to look at those this is a

252
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:29,500
screen capture from I think last night

253
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,930
so when we first arrived actually even

254
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,480
before we first arrived we ship out what

255
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,239
we call a scout it's a little ubiquity

256
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,130
router as a key fairly small and we ship

257
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,810
it to the site and either we install it

258
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,750
when we come out from the site visit or

259
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,119
we get the hotel to install it and what

260
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,430
this device does is it starts announcing

261
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,260
our address space it allows us to test

262
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,650
the circuits make sure the EGP stuff

263
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,230
works more importantly it also allows

264
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,959
geolocation providers to learn where we

265
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,150
are so when you search for like pizza or

266
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,420
poutine you find the local pizza or

267
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:08,800
poutine in Montreal and not in weight

268
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:11,380
loss type Prague Prague it also allows

269
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,709
us to start turning up the IETF - Hotel

270
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:18,670
SSID which we use to sort of pivot and

271
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,980
build the rest of a network well why did

272
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,020
that go down one there we go that

273
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,060
bounced Bromley um

274
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,329
so I'm checking the time because I've

275
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:31,119
got a lot to get through for circuits we

276
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,640
get at least two circuits sometimes up

277
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,490
to five and these are almost always

278
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,110
donated by local providers so we have a

279
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,690
bunch of local providers who we deal

280
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,180
with and they provide us with the circus

281
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,220
we try really hard what are you laughing

282
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,040
at which we try really hard to get

283
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,290
redundant connectivity so two providers

284
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,160
different providers two sets of fibers

285
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:57,199
two sets of entrances etc and up until

286
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,630
now we've very much always been doing

287
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,880
one gig circus a number of providers

288
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,280
have been offering us ten but we found

289
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,740
that one is up until now sort of largely

290
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,720
sufficient and seems to be stifling it

291
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,980
slightly more stable but I think in the

292
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,050
future we're probably going to be

293
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,690
getting ten gig circuits the robbers we

294
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,969
have can do up to ten sorry after a

295
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,950
hundred we also require that the

296
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,250
provider gives us dual stack you know

297
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,410
with IP v4 and v6 and that they will

298
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,480
speak BGP with us so we can announce our

299
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,810
own address space that way we can use

300
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,110
the same address space where we go um

301
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:36,290
four core routers we currently have two

302
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,120
juniper MX 2 o fours this is actually

303
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,329
the first meeting where we've been using

304
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,520
the MX to a horse up until now we've

305
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,020
been using juniper MX ATS or at least

306
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,500
for the last many years we need to be

307
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:51,620
using her ex ATS the convergence time on

308
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,840
those was quite long as part of building

309
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,400
the network we build everything and then

310
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,820
before the attendees arrive we do

311
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,890
failover testing it was taking about 25

312
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,980
minutes or so for b gb to converge with

313
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:06,050
the MX 80s thanks to the new donations

314
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,560
from juniper it now converges in like a

315
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,750
minute or a minute and a half the

316
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,869
corridors are obviously our core routers

317
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,270
they do BGP for the last number of

318
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,640
meetings we've also do been doing our PK

319
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,699
validation and throwing away invalid

320
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:26,240
routes they also support you know

321
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:30,460
obvious services like OSPF 53 there are

322
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,020
the DHCP relays do our RA advertisements

323
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,630
we also try and general sort of follow

324
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:40,010
best practices so we do things like pcp

325
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:42,230
38 the routers also do pass up learning

326
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,240
and if we have time at the end of this

327
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,560
which I don't know if we will how

328
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,339
quickly go into that because it's kind

329
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,439
of entertaining is going the wrong way

330
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:54,130
somebody push the right button instead

331
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,130
of the down button

332
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:05,990
right can I click right there we go

333
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:09,800
it seemed like a really good idea so for

334
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,230
switches we have a pair of Cisco

335
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,020
Catalyst 4500 X's which we run in a

336
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:19,250
stack configuration we also deploy

337
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:22,250
around 10 or so IDF switches and 40 or

338
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,839
so 12-foot switches the 12-foot switches

339
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,449
are the little switches that we plug

340
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,708
access points into if you've ever sat in

341
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,050
the front row you've probably seen a

342
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,630
bunch of them we also use them for

343
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,550
things like video streaming etc

344
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:39,140
basically general switches whenever we

345
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:40,760
need one we deploy those all of these we

346
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,360
now manage with something which we call

347
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,550
Joe's magic this is basically a sort of

348
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,270
ztp type system which has been designed

349
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:54,020
by Joe Clark hi Joe

350
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:56,480
and this allows us to take a new switch

351
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,280
out of the box plug it in and it

352
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,800
automatically config it configures

353
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,010
itself in the right way does software

354
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,810
upgrades etc this actually turns out to

355
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,640
be really important

356
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,980
we don't just sort of deploy the network

357
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,990
once rooms often get converted into

358
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,810
things like penury rooms at which time

359
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,570
we have to move switches around etc if

360
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:19,879
it wasn't for the CTP type thing we'd

361
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,040
have to do that manually and it turns

362
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,650
out that IETF participants often plug in

363
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,570
laptops with DHCP servers or something

364
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,220
like that on so having a system which

365
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,139
automatically configures itself learns

366
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,020
where up links are etc is really useful

367
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,250
I'm just gonna go forward or down it's

368
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:41,300
gonna go down we pick the right button I

369
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,850
tested it before using that so for

370
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:47,659
wireless we have to Cisco wireless LAN

371
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,189
controllers which we run an H a pair we

372
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,260
also travel with they're much smaller

373
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,750
little wireless LAN controller which we

374
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,640
use both for testing we also often end

375
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,860
up supporting that an eye socket visor

376
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,680
II committee meeting after the IETF or

377
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,330
sometimes similar type meetings this is

378
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,030
a small little wireless LAN controller

379
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,340
that we can leave behind when we pack

380
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,350
the rest of the network

381
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,620
we in general deploy somewhere between

382
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:16,669
50 and 70 access points this has a to do

383
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,379
which I forgot to do we have I think 68

384
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,740
access points deployed for this

385
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:25,970
particular meeting yeah 68 plus testing

386
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:29,660
1 sir and our access points do both 5

387
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,850
gig and 2.4 we serve steer people

388
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,420
towards using 5 because obviously it

389
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,740
works a lot better um the Cisco wireless

390
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,960
LAN controllers have actually been

391
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,200
really good for us they've solved a lot

392
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,260
of the arc problem if people remember

393
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:50,270
the hard meeting of the previous one but

394
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:53,660
the one before that the one before that

395
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,970
while we keep going back to Prague 93 we

396
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,710
were having a lot of issues with arc

397
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,860
because we announced a huge amount of

398
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,240
public address space to the internet and

399
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,419
everybody scanning would cause ARP

400
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,280
requests this would cause the wireless

401
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,260
infrastructure to send out Arps which

402
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,790
would wake up everybody's phones and so

403
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,940
people getting served half a day or

404
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,920
three-quarters of a day battery life if

405
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,870
your phone now lasts longer than 3/4 of

406
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,010
a day you should thank panda who's over

407
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:27,080
there say hi panda we also have a whole

408
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:29,870
bunch of encrypted SSIDs IETF IETF 2.4

409
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,449
only the ITF nat64 v6 only nat64

410
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,909
unencrypted jerome I suck it's a whole

411
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:38,030
long list something that would be really

412
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,370
useful further on and this this buff is

413
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,800
understanding what people actually want

414
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,870
which of these CSS IDs people need which

415
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,480
of them are providing useful service if

416
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,729
there any here we don't need any more or

417
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,990
if there are additional services we

418
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:56,660
should be providing moving on to the

419
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,250
guest room I have a bad habit of calling

420
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,500
this the hotel networks I've actually

421
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:05,540
end up calling it you know ITF hotel I

422
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,429
meaning the guestroom Network um so it

423
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,940
turns out that in case you have noticed

424
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:14,690
IETF what has been so weird like really

425
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,400
weird when hotels build their guestroom

426
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,100
networks they build them for sort of

427
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,509
more normal people this means that they

428
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,879
deploy things I kept for

429
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:25,429
which do intersecting and rewriting of

430
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:28,129
DNS a lot of them also do interception

431
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:30,230
of HTTP and do serve managing to make

432
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:33,678
that we direct direct people to capture

433
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,230
portals hotel networks also generally do

434
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,549
not and of course they need to do things

435
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,899
like filter dangerous sports like SSH

436
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,759
they're also built with a set of

437
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:46,488
assumptions which is that people will

438
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,350
have a limited number of devices use a

439
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:51,470
limited amount of bandwidth have leaded

440
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:55,820
amid a number of sessions and also

441
00:21:51,470 --> 00:22:02,570
almost always they have no ipv6 this

442
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:04,119
would make much a serpent's sad so all

443
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,189
we need is an extra button on the remote

444
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:14,449
so when we arrived we've been taking

445
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:15,649
over the guest room network so what

446
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,570
we've been doing has been taking over

447
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:20,570
the guest room network and replacing it

448
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,210
with a pair of ubiquity routers which

449
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,519
you call the hotel routers and the spy

450
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,559
passes the hotel's sort of Hotelling

451
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,989
solution they're captive portal all of

452
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,720
that in many cases we actually just get

453
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:35,600
a VLAN before there there Hotelling

454
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,450
solution and we turn up the IETF - Hotel

455
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,178
SSID and we generally provide internet

456
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:45,409
access for everyone in the hotel we

457
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:47,119
believe free internet for all something

458
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:48,980
that's interesting and people probably

459
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,139
haven't run into this is many hotels

460
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:54,440
have somewhat inventive architectures

461
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:57,529
for example one of the locations we went

462
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,769
to had 2.4 gig of radios and everything

463
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:01,999
was on the same channel oh it seemed

464
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:05,809
like a good idea when they installed it

465
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:07,940
they're like we'll use channel 6 another

466
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,519
thing which we ran into I think this was

467
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,070
in the last meeting in Prague access

468
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,929
points on elevators this sounds like a

469
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,379
really good idea that way when you in

470
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:19,580
elevator you can check your email

471
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:21,918
unfortunately if your hotel room is

472
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,449
anywhere near the elevators the access

473
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:29,629
point arrives and you're like there is a

474
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:31,759
good signal and then you're like go also

475
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:34,159
hotels have billion bent of physical

476
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,860
plants so we've seen Ethernet over coax

477
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,480
and I don't mean DOCSIS I mean like a

478
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,860
special little box which just runs

479
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,170
Ethernet over coax and something

480
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,479
proprietary in the middle of course

481
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,250
you've also seen Doc's SDSL you know cat

482
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,890
3 cable

483
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,020
another thing that's sadly common is

484
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,240
we'll take over the guest room network

485
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,070
and it's only then that the hotel learns

486
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,050
that there is a restaurant point-of-sale

487
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,879
and there are mini bars and their

488
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,720
thermostats etc all used up guest

489
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,620
network so interesting things which we

490
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,270
find we also run a large number of

491
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,580
services in order to support the network

492
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:15,110
so we have three physical servers and

493
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:17,600
three other servers which we use to

494
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,850
build and run the network we've been

495
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:25,540
using ganodi and docker to allow us to

496
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:29,840
sort of Bob's looking concerned ok

497
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:32,540
you're looking you're looking pensive so

498
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,270
we provide a bunch of services DNS DNS

499
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:39,980
SEC we've also been doing recently DNS

500
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:42,460
over TLS also not sorry dns64 which we

501
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,510
need to support our Nexus nat64

502
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,460
obviously a bunch of other things which

503
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:51,379
you would expect DHCP dhcpv6 ntp we have

504
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,470
a ticketing server so people in submit

505
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,670
tickets and we can deal with issues and

506
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,470
then a lot of other things which are

507
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,290
more sort of interests infrastructure or

508
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:02,810
plumbing things like rpki cache fall

509
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,350
into that tacacs servers so that we can

510
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:08,720
authenticate to our devices easily etc

511
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,490
we have been trying relatively hard over

512
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,130
the last couple of meetings to move to

513
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,960
more of sort of a DevOps model so we can

514
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,610
design and build things commit it in

515
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,200
something I could get repo and then be

516
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,240
able to rebuild and restage things

517
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,010
instead of having sort of long-running

518
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,640
servers which we have to keep

519
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:29,420
maintaining monitoring we also have a

520
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,220
whole slew of monitoring things we seem

521
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,810
to often end up experimenting with a new

522
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,700
monitoring thing and then migrating to

523
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,950
another one and we haven't always

524
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,760
managed to to deprecated the older ones

525
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:44,390
I put the slide in because I knew people

526
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:47,450
have questions before we leave we back

527
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,690
up our servers but before we do that we

528
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,820
may

529
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,100
sure that we scrub all PII from the

530
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,500
servers before yeah before we pack them

531
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,908
up and also that while way that way

532
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,909
while they're being shipped around Oh

533
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:09,309
personally identifiable information so

534
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:12,049
you know logs DHCP logs etc thank you um

535
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:13,639
one of the main purposes of the network

536
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:16,100
it used to be just throw four

537
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:19,399
participants these days it's also to

538
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:22,428
support remote participation we actually

539
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:25,489
have a separate VLAN for the meet echo

540
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:27,590
and streaming streaming traffic we also

541
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:32,090
provide a number of VMs for the meet

542
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:34,189
echo system when there's sort of common

543
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,428
or like interesting sessions it's

544
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,379
currently around 60 Meg or so of traffic

545
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,570
is being streamed from the VMS up to the

546
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:45,199
internet it's around 60 mega or so for a

547
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,610
much participation traffic as I said the

548
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,580
network we build sort of makes that

549
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,500
remote participation possible meet echo

550
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,870
and Cascadian the people who do the

551
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,509
video streaming have actually done

552
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,059
events on sort of regular venue networks

553
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:02,480
before but they've only managed to do

554
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:05,480
streaming not remote participation from

555
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,639
talking to meet echo they think that the

556
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,850
limited bandwidth map firewalls like a

557
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:13,969
v6 would prevent them from doing good

558
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,709
remote participation and Cascadian folks

559
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:20,330
said basically the hotel network just

560
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,500
won't work for us so I've gone through a

561
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,629
bunch of stuff really quickly

562
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,350
you deserve a kitten for having sat

563
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:30,799
through all of this here's your kitten

564
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:32,840
while that was well done another purpose

565
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,350
of the ITF network is sort of

566
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,580
experiments or eating our own dog food

567
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,320
we do these experiments carefully

568
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,049
obviously and you actually need to get

569
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,100
them approved by the IETF chair so these

570
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:49,970
aren't just things which we we do easily

571
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:53,418
um as an example we ran one of the very

572
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,100
early DMS ro TLS services this was made

573
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:56,659
a little bit more tricky than a normal

574
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,000
deployment because we were such do

575
00:27:56,659 --> 00:28:01,580
strange things to make dns64 which we

576
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,679
use fanatics for what properly

577
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,418
we did it for a couple of meetings it's

578
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,429
now become a standard supported service

579
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:11,090
because it seems to be being widely

580
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:14,840
deployed and used another experiment

581
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:18,408
needed fairly recently was v6 own v6

582
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,789
only and by that we mean real v6 only we

583
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:25,629
put the v6 ups and six-man meetings in a

584
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:29,389
separately served separate area of the

585
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:31,969
hotel and then we turned off I PV for on

586
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:34,008
all of the radios near them so that the

587
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:38,779
only access that was in those rooms was

588
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:42,679
v6 much hilarity ensued it turns out

589
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:44,179
that a lot of devices and a lot of

590
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,169
things become sad if there's absolutely

591
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:50,090
no v4 network available to them at all

592
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:52,039
things like various operating systems

593
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,879
were not happy if they could not talk to

594
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:59,859
a DHCP server things like that related

595
00:28:55,879 --> 00:29:04,609
to that was net 6 for testing this was

596
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:06,080
something where at IETF 100 bunch of

597
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,359
people in Toronto in the hackathon and

598
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,678
did an inventory of a lot of different

599
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,080
applications and different operating

600
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,840
systems to figure out how things have I

601
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,999
with net 6 for a number of bugs were

602
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,220
found a number of things actually got

603
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:21,609
fixed I believe that Spotify for one at

604
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,409
least fix their let's explore processing

605
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:27,470
bunch of things got got made better from

606
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:30,049
this final one just because we're

607
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,299
running here on time Mac randomization

608
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:34,700
this was something that we did in sort

609
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:37,879
of cooperation with the I Triple E in

610
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,460
order to improve privacy there was a I

611
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:42,619
Triple E sort of effort to see what

612
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,779
would happen if devices randomized their

613
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:47,779
MAC addresses potentially at a fairly

614
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:49,940
short timescale and we did this on our

615
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:51,470
network to understand what would what

616
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,220
the implications in this some switch

617
00:29:51,470 --> 00:30:02,139
architectures DHCP servers router nd

618
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:06,619
caches etc would be Carlos who was that

619
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:10,189
Carlos Carlos probably has more info and

620
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:11,988
not Joe keys in the room and I think I

621
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,179
have like two minutes for clarifying

622
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:14,940
questions but there is going to be a

623
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,930
whole session

624
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,730
to the Sun you know which of these

625
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,280
services are important what do we need

626
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,440
to do that we don't etcetera you can ask

627
00:30:20,280 --> 00:31:23,850
now if you want to but I did it faster

628
00:30:22,440 --> 00:31:25,170
than expected yeah I mean a number of

629
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,850
these things are just for our own

630
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,310
internal infrastructure like you know

631
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:31,110
get repos and syslog those are just for

632
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,550
us but one of the things I should have

633
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,620
mentioned on the slide is there are a

634
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,030
lot of services here you know if there

635
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,860
are some of them we didn't need that

636
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,330
would be really good to know and that we

637
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,699
can turn on and off and make our lives

638
00:31:39,330 --> 00:32:00,090
easier

639
00:31:40,700 --> 00:32:02,370
anyone else Adam I believe it's happened

640
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:07,050
almost every time I think we've once had

641
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:09,840
to buy circuits and recent and memory we

642
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,760
had to buy local routes not circuits at

643
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,300
Clemens Clemens can you use the

644
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,310
microphone please I can say so what yeah

645
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,649
so what Clemens said is we once that

646
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,990
we've in recent memory we had once buy

647
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:25,140
local loops the bandwidth was still

648
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:28,230
still donated but pretty much every

649
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,800
other time the provider brings the

650
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,180
circuit or the

651
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,669
way to us drops it off gives us

652
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,560
bandwidth Suites BGP you know we put

653
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,660
their name are coming slides this last

654
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,500
time it will this current time was tell

655
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:43,020
us and micro optic and they we you know

656
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,810
kindly gate open gave our circuits so

657
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,480
look us to us okay

658
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:52,740
I'm just gonna go to the virtual queue

659
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,080
okay go ahead one hi

660
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,930
so to answer the question on circuits

661
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,899
the truth is that we've basically gone

662
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:03,060
to friendly in friendly folks to get

663
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,710
circuits throughout the years and and

664
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:08,520
frankly it's been done through

665
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:11,880
friendships through folks who are in the

666
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,010
area that we have relationships with but

667
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,110
there there's always been money set

668
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,970
aside in the budget to be able to handle

669
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,570
the contingency in case something went

670
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,410
wrong

671
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:25,110
that said we that we have had scenarios

672
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:28,650
actually in Korea we had to buy circuits

673
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,850
as well as local loops and the last time

674
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,940
we're in San Francisco we had to buy

675
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:35,370
circuits so it does happen it's it's not

676
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,930
super common and then figuring out a

677
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,169
scaleable solution that doesn't require

678
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,100
someone to have lots of good friends is

679
00:33:39,170 --> 00:34:09,030
it's something that needs to be figured

680
00:33:41,100 --> 00:34:11,339
out it has also been a no when we do go

681
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,840
places we do often have friends you know

682
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,610
if we've been somewhere before we often

683
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,350
contact the same same providers and

684
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,640
asked if they can do again but it's

685
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:21,319
actually a significant amount of work to

686
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,319
get the Soviets organized and set up

687
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:43,609
so somewhat with icon I actually have a

688
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:45,210
to do to put Shaun in touch with you so

689
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,578
mission accomplished

690
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,109
yeah that was on my to-do list we should

691
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:54,139
coordinate better to make sure that we

692
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:54,139
can can be that Jason

693
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,680
there's like stable electricity and

694
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,180
water in your room right and so those

695
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,220
networks tend to have gotten quite a bit

696
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,680
better and some of the anecdotes may be

697
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:39,520
you know a bit dated in sort of holding

698
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,919
us in your mental state here so I

699
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,930
suspect like when I travel most places I

700
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,460
you know can get great access and if I'm

701
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,669
concerned about getting services I pop

702
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,940
up a VPN I suspect that that might be a

703
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,950
viable solution to me yeah the thing is

704
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,420
women I mean that Tiffany a point we

705
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,250
should discuss that further one of the

706
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,200
things to keep in mind possibly is when

707
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:02,500
you travel you're generally not

708
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,290
traveling with 1200 other ietf to take

709
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,820
people who have a different use case I

710
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,200
mean sometimes obviously sometimes

711
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,550
that's not true

712
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,319
there are other places where there are

713
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,140
lots of usage fair enough but that's a

714
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:20,619
bandwidth problem right the services

715
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:24,310
maybe no it's not okay I can comment on

716
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:27,070
that from having run some of these yeah

717
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,900
there's a number of funky issues with

718
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,640
the architecture of those networks as

719
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,950
opposed to just say their raw capacity

720
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,770
or the size of their NAT box or their

721
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:38,890
residential gateways so things like

722
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,990
configuration issues this network has a

723
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,339
limit on the number for the hotel

724
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,009
network here has a little bit on the

725
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,430
number of broadcast packets it's

726
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,850
prepared to see and so when there's 800

727
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:54,190
devices which is significantly more than

728
00:36:50,850 --> 00:37:08,830
say they normally see a normal hotel

729
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:11,800
night they lose like Arabic and so what

730
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:13,150
I would say is that I think the

731
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,940
assertion that these networks are

732
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,880
getting better is actually pretty

733
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:23,410
accurate they're not necessarily as good

734
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,830
as the expectation that is currently

735
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:28,660
placed on the hotel network I expect

736
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:32,080
that over time personally that they will

737
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,140
get there but certainly that is not the

738
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:38,400
case today I mean they have

739
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,410
I mean getting better : JS I'm not

740
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,940
coming I do go to other conferences full

741
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,558
of technical people or the hotel

742
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,720
networks generally work and when they

743
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:48,210
don't everyone's cell phone continues to

744
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,879
work is it's not as big a deal as it was

745
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:52,559
10 years ago I look I understand that we

746
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,420
have an expectation for v6 and that's

747
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,920
probably often not delivered but to get

748
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,960
our job done which mostly involves

749
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,539
sending email and getting to a webpage

750
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,759
you don't actually need that um I want

751
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:04,859
to ask a question about the bandwidth I

752
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:06,690
understand that if we offer unlimited

753
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:08,400
bandwidth that we will use a lot of

754
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,140
bandwidth but the question is not how

755
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,910
much we use how much we need you guys

756
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,359
have any tools or major you're thinking

757
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:17,578
about that because like this megabit

758
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,410
upload per person seems more than any

759
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,529
other conference I go to is provisioning

760
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:24,960
app that includes ARP our conferences so

761
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:26,970
I don't have the long term graphs up

762
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,660
here we've been getting close to a gig

763
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:32,519
and you know I understand you use that

764
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,799
if you allow unlimited the question is

765
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,149
is what's using all of that and if you

766
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:37,410
limited it down like what would happen

767
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,180
at what point would it become

768
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,660
frustrating for people getting work done

769
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,660
here

770
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:49,720
I mean all you need is my IP addresses

771
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,850
so send me your logs and you already

772
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,220
have that answer but why not I mean like

773
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,560
I'm asking for and you know intuitive

774
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,180
feels more so I mean how much we use

775
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,560
when you have an unlimited bandwidth is

776
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,210
a useless number you need to say how

777
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,920
much we need that's true but so far

778
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,350
we've been getting we've been giving

779
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,900
office of 10 gig circuits and offers of

780
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,700
one gig circuits we we're not we haven't

781
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,380
been bandwidth constrained at any time

782
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,210
if we had been that idea we had yeah

783
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,930
actually you there's somewhat different

784
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,700
you guys keep saying we've been

785
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,910
bandwidth on strains I feel very

786
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,410
differently I feel that the bandwidth

787
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,940
requirements are causing us to not be

788
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,770
able to go to many venues we could

789
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,180
otherwise go to so I feel we have been

790
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:31,540
bandwidth constraint so that's just my

791
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:36,460
way so just what I'd like to do is I'd

792
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:38,080
like to cut the mic lines and also we do

793
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,820
have a whole set of questions after this

794
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,710
which was meant to delve into it so this

795
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,900
was really intended to be clarifications

796
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:50,980
on what he was saying and not debates

797
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:53,440
about whether it's right or wrong so one

798
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,110
one clarification I'd like to point out

799
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,160
here is we do have really the two

800
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,660
networks as you said we've got the

801
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,359
guestroom network and we've got the

802
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,560
network at large and as we have this

803
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,630
conversation I think it'd be really

804
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,580
really good for us to keep very focused

805
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,710
on when we say well I really need this

806
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,720
massive stuff visibility and we have

807
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,000
1,200 people that's true we have people

808
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,709
in the get or the meeting space we do

809
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,350
not have 1,200 people in the guest room

810
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:21,430
it's and a lot of people are off-site in

811
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:23,589
fact I rough numbers we do let about 600

812
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:26,109
people typically in a hotel I guess but

813
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,790
it varies that means well half our

814
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,370
attendees are actually not staying ti2

815
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,690
hotel there are someplace else that not

816
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,339
these guests food network so keep that

817
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,230
in mind as we have this conversation boy

818
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:40,420
it really really need and what you baby

819
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:44,500
don't need hmm did you want feedback on

820
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:46,270
the SSID or not now not now so Mike one

821
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,190
of the things Karen's gonna say at some

822
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,560
point is we're trying to get general

823
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,450
sort of high-level overview of what

824
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,860
people need not actually down into the

825
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:58,359
engineering level yeah charity again

826
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,770
real quick

827
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,470
something I said before about about the

828
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:06,590
ipv6 on the guest or I'm sorry on the

829
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:09,259
guestroom network is when we tried to do

830
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:11,120
that once I think it was that nod we

831
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,310
ended up with all of the broadcast

832
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,710
traffic on v6 actually going and taking

833
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:18,049
down the hotel Wireless and the regular

834
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,290
packets couldn't actually get through on

835
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:23,510
that so it's it's definitely a real

836
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,220
operational issue and something that

837
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,650
should come up in other working groups

838
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,029
here about how how these technologies

839
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,760
that originally desired for the wired

840
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,870
network interact on the wireless

841
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,060
topology so the other comment about

842
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,839
bandwidth I know I saw Jim go in and out

843
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,090
of the queue

844
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,070
you know since most of the band list is

845
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,170
donated or functionally free to the IETF

846
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,840
I don't see a reason to limit that and

847
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:48,020
also even if we had to commercially get

848
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,550
it the cost per bit is so low you know

849
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,030
commercially available it's you know

850
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,500
let's say you know less than a buck a

851
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,970
megabit I think is a reasonable number

852
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,320
and if you actually know what the prices

853
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:02,270
are oh it's money less than that but

854
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,580
actually speaking of broadcasting stuff

855
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,950
we do XD Kevin's boxes does a lot of

856
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,140
magic to cut down on focus but Timon's

857
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,779
men were done yeah Clemence sets me

858
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,700
clément shop I'm also part of the not

859
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,160
cede my responsibilities are getting

860
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,600
bits into the building and also stuffing

861
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,730
those bits back into the booty Network

862
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:25,400
so most of the topics we've discussed so

863
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:28,760
far touch mic my my responsibility again

864
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,890
I have to concur with Jared that getting

865
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,480
bits or getting lots of them it's not a

866
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,509
problem in fact we've been turning down

867
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,420
people offering us 10g so this is this

868
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:41,120
does not limit our venue selection with

869
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,860
one exception that I've recently heard

870
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,740
of that I don't know if I can discuss a

871
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,300
couple it's it sometimes it's it depends

872
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,189
on a country and it's not a matter of

873
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,080
how many bentwood but getting been put

874
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,360
into the thing in general like for

875
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:56,870
instance in China or in that air in that

876
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,490
region but if we get stuff or if we get

877
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,930
bits into the building it really doesn't

878
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,319
matter if it's one gear ten gear

879
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,129
whatever

880
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,810
so these days it's not a problem and

881
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,670
with regards to v6 in the guest rooms

882
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,230
that is also not a problem the biggest

883
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,330
biggest biggest biggest problem that we

884
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,120
have both in guest rooms and in all

885
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:16,850
is the open before internet because

886
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,540
we're being skinned like from the

887
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,210
outside

888
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:25,540
so in Clement you see is this a question

889
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:31,670
for clarification yeah really seriously

890
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:34,820
right I just sure right I we do that is

891
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:39,440
a big problem my I'm just saying v6 it's

892
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:41,000
not a problem right so Mike did we we

893
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,930
had cut the line

894
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,420
do you have something really really

895
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,480
quick oh yeah actually one of the things

896
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,490
that as people were trying out

897
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,710
technology changes in the available

898
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:54,709
networking infrastructure in the hotels

899
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:57,920
not just the availability of it but the

900
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,600
transition from E to G to things what

901
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,760
are you seeing with respect to that lag

902
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,720
between them and us it's not a huge

903
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,330
amount I can answer that

904
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,950
other than people have been upgrading so

905
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,080
for example last time we were in the Sun

906
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,790
hurt in this hotel there was a very

907
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,090
different wireless infrastructure to now

908
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:18,500
so hotels are actually upgrading their

909
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,860
infrastructure it's becoming a lot more

910
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:24,200
reasonable sometimes actually kind of

911
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,700
driven by us you know we suggest really

912
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,490
strongly that we're more likely to come

913
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,640
back if the network was made thinner I

914
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:33,620
think that Prague also some of the

915
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,660
participant the standard Hilton we go to

916
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,190
improv operating was because we said you

917
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,839
know your current infrastructure doesn't

918
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:43,700
really support us please make it better

919
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:46,910
so now that we have heard about the

920
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,470
network I would like the guys who are in

921
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:53,390
the room that are part of the NOC team

922
00:44:48,470 --> 00:45:03,140
to stand up so you can put a face to the

923
00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:06,790
people who actually do all that work all

924
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,790
the guys and girls in the room

925
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:13,140
so I had a couple quick notes before we

926
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,400
start down this presentation the first

927
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,009
one was we didn't actually do a really

928
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,140
good job early on is saying you know we

929
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,460
do site qualifications Clemens got into

930
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,080
that he does a lot of the work for sy

931
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,750
qualifications Jim had done a lot of

932
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,310
that work so we do as part of the venue

933
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,160
selection process go and check out the

934
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:31,830
hotels so the second thing is we we have

935
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,950
tried to level up to a set of user

936
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:37,319
facing requirements some of the detailed

937
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,939
stuff we expect to we could have further

938
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,820
conversations possibly on a mailing list

939
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,670
and we'll get to that at the end but I

940
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:49,020
do think we are trying to get here as a

941
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:51,180
team we would like to simplify where we

942
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:55,680
can so we're trying to make our own jobs

943
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:57,660
easier so we're not so I'd like to put

944
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,430
that out there first as you know we are

945
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,569
looking to simplify and then the second

946
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,040
thing I want to put out there is we are

947
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,950
trying to distinguish the difference

948
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,660
between and I think Cullen was getting

949
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,609
to this we are kind of distinguished

950
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,490
between the difference of what we want

951
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:13,890
and what we need and so I would I would

952
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,470
them you know feedback on where that

953
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:22,650
line is would be really useful and with

954
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:24,569
that so a couple basic assumptions we've

955
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,160
already talked about this we're going to

956
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,290
focus on user requirements we're not

957
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,950
here to design the network second thing

958
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:32,820
is we do have two sets of requirements

959
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,169
we're going to go through there is a

960
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,490
difference between the venue network

961
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,839
which is in all the meeting rooms and

962
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,040
those kinds of things and the guest room

963
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:42,049
network and we've already alluded to

964
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:47,700
that in some ways and so we want to

965
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:53,670
focus on that so question number one we

966
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:57,560
need a network right eye health so let's

967
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:57,560
do it this way hum if you want a network

968
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,740
hum if you think that the ITF would be

969
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:13,710
more productive without network

970
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:15,180
connectivity I I have on occasion heard

971
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,560
somebody say that perhaps if we turned

972
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,879
off the network in a room people would

973
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,599
pay better attention but that's another

974
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,309
question for another day

975
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:27,219
all right so this was supposed to be the

976
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:28,839
easy question so you all do travel so do

977
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,390
you think the network provided by most

978
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:33,578
venues with without any enhancements is

979
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,129
sufficient and that probably means no

980
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:40,329
PFI pv6 and it probably has gnats and

981
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:41,469
captive portals and what we'll do is

982
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,609
we'll have a little bit of discussion

983
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:45,670
and then we'll try and do a home at the

984
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:47,170
end of each of these questions I wanted

985
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:51,969
to use a slider app but they wouldn't

986
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:53,529
let me turn Jared much previous

987
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:56,739
professional traveler now currently

988
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:58,599
semi-professional traveler in in most

989
00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:01,029
cases including at large conferences

990
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,819
over the years I found that the venue's

991
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:05,709
have generally upgraded to bandwidth you

992
00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:10,029
know it's dependent upon the hotel chain

993
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:13,448
and whatnot but for the most part if it

994
00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:15,329
works and even even in the technical you

995
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:18,759
know the more technical places where

996
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:21,099
like you know an an OGG or an errand or

997
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:23,109
write or something like that those

998
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:24,249
networks functions efficiently that the

999
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,739
attendees are able to get their work

1000
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:30,339
done and they have specifically not

1001
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:37,239
taken over the hotel network because

1002
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:40,150
there are many dragons in there so my

1003
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:43,089
experience from other sets of

1004
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:46,449
conferences with technical audience is

1005
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:48,999
that I'm often dissatisfied with the

1006
00:48:46,449 --> 00:48:52,170
performance of the network if it work

1007
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:54,968
isn't being done by a professional team

1008
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:56,349
if that matter if that means taking over

1009
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:58,509
the network or whatever it means I don't

1010
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:00,789
I mean I don't exactly know but I do

1011
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:03,819
know that when we when I go to

1012
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:05,769
conferences where it's as is it usually

1013
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:08,288
doesn't help me I don't get enough work

1014
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:12,339
down I can't work that's efficient or

1015
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:14,410
well and to the extent that some of

1016
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:17,619
these conferences are longer series of

1017
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,479
meetings the trend has been for the

1018
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:23,469
conference organizers to do more

1019
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:25,089
other than that for leaders to you know

1020
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:29,019
to respond to the requirements of the

1021
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:33,109
attendees but I I'm not sure that this

1022
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:35,209
is a good way discussing the ways idea

1023
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:40,038
and do less I think it's gonna sub up

1024
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:41,689
devices my name is Tim Shepherd I've

1025
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,209
been do an awful lot of IETF meetings

1026
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:46,459
and my travel plans often have me

1027
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:48,408
staying over Friday night and then

1028
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:50,538
flying out either Saturday morning or

1029
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:53,029
some day Saturday afternoon or maybe go

1030
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:55,009
on Sunday and usually at some point on

1031
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:59,179
Friday the hotel Network reverts to the

1032
00:49:55,009 --> 00:50:02,509
hotel's network and in my experience at

1033
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:04,459
least half the time it's pretty sad and

1034
00:50:02,509 --> 00:50:06,949
it's not though I don't believe is that

1035
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:08,928
the hotel lock network lacks capacity to

1036
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:11,390
and from the internet it's that the

1037
00:50:08,929 --> 00:50:14,209
captive portal system isn't prepared to

1038
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:16,399
deal with the numbers of people who are

1039
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:18,529
wanting to use it and that's even when

1040
00:50:16,399 --> 00:50:21,409
probably more than half the IKEA people

1041
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:23,449
are very much and I usually do manage to

1042
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:25,279
get on but I usually have to try several

1043
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:28,189
times sometimes it has kind of just

1044
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:30,799
worked but at least half the time it

1045
00:50:28,189 --> 00:50:32,269
doesn't just work and so I think it's

1046
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:33,890
the captive portal and it may also be

1047
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:36,799
that they don't have enough internal

1048
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,509
DHCP addresses to hand out so even if

1049
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,949
you didn't even get to the captive

1050
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:41,689
portal or after you get to the captive

1051
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:43,759
portal and wants to do another DHCP

1052
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:45,979
something like this I've tried to debug

1053
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:48,859
it and it's a different weird story and

1054
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:50,209
every other new and I think you know

1055
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:52,159
maybe we don't need to bring our own

1056
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:53,538
network into the IHF but I think we have

1057
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,089
to get there captive portal out of the

1058
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:59,149
way and make sure you know but I can't I

1059
00:50:56,089 --> 00:51:00,769
can't imagine that's any easier and we

1060
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:02,058
can handle that Friday night Saturday

1061
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:06,158
morning we're about to go home anyway

1062
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:06,159
but if it was that way all week I think

1063
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:12,799
so college eggs um I think for the most

1064
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,749
part I find that what I want to be able

1065
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:16,519
to do is browse the web and do email and

1066
00:51:14,749 --> 00:51:18,618
that those work fine through all the

1067
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:20,479
existing hotel networks maybe yeah

1068
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:22,669
ninety-eight percent of time at this

1069
00:51:20,479 --> 00:51:24,558
point I do think it's worth asking are

1070
00:51:22,669 --> 00:51:26,479
there specific things that that wouldn't

1071
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,369
work for us in that and then the check

1072
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:31,609
oh and remote participation was brought

1073
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:33,380
up earlier I don't know what the status

1074
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:36,558
of those products is but I know that you

1075
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:38,689
know all the web RTC based conference

1076
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,759
major every vendors major conferences as

1077
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:43,069
soon as web RTC based works fine through

1078
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:45,499
v4 or v6 with or without Nats

1079
00:51:43,069 --> 00:51:46,270
at this point in time so I I don't think

1080
00:51:45,499 --> 00:51:48,189
that that should can

1081
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,660
continued to be a problem at this point

1082
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:51,990
in time or really any time in lost for

1083
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,040
five years

1084
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:56,080
Melissa Cooper :

1085
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,970
stole what I was gonna say but I think

1086
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,319
it would be useful if people can speak

1087
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,810
to you the things that they would not be

1088
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,900
able to do that they need to do get

1089
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:07,210
their work done during the IDF's week

1090
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:09,460
under the different scenarios not just

1091
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:11,140
like would it be better like does it

1092
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,880
make you sad like of course the captive

1093
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:15,790
portal makes everybody very sad we all

1094
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,290
hate them but what we do deal with them

1095
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:22,210
in other situations and so I think the

1096
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:26,560
the more objective like I wouldn't be

1097
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:32,440
able to do X if would be useful to make

1098
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:34,120
a list of that 10:30 and I think the

1099
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,540
good news is the rest of the world's

1100
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,549
requirements have slowly crept up well

1101
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,830
ours have kept pretty stable over time

1102
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:44,830
and the result of that is we're much

1103
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:48,340
more often in conditions that are close

1104
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:50,200
to what on-site attendants are used to

1105
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,980
in other places they remember this is

1106
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,899
not the case

1107
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,250
Mike st. John's may remember the size of

1108
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,260
the circuit but I seem to remember that

1109
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,700
when we went to Stockholm the first time

1110
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,850
they actually doubled the capacity

1111
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:05,830
coming into the country in order to deal

1112
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:08,860
with the ietf yeah it so it was like 56

1113
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:11,049
kbps additional line was impressive at

1114
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:13,330
the time right so they doubled the

1115
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,100
country's capacity nobody said we

1116
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:18,970
weren't Johnny Appleseed or Johnny

1117
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:21,069
applesauce you know the capacity and had

1118
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,390
that make some more the good news is on

1119
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,910
site I think we're actually pretty close

1120
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:26,830
but I think the point that Cullen made

1121
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:29,830
obliquely is much more important and

1122
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:32,560
that is the ability to have remote

1123
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:34,600
participation be effective is going to

1124
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,110
become more and more important for the

1125
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:41,620
ITF as we try and broaden their base and

1126
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:43,630
as we try and make sure that we begin to

1127
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,819
bring that into things like hackathons

1128
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,790
and other places for the kinds of

1129
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:51,130
interaction or both WebRTC and github

1130
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:53,110
and local participation or going on at

1131
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:56,170
once so it actually suggests that rather

1132
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:58,150
than focusing on local participation

1133
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:00,820
that the NOC team as it's looking at

1134
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:04,810
these focus on what it would take to

1135
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:07,150
make remote participation work or double

1136
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:09,430
the numbers we have now and make sure

1137
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,660
that if we can reach that without hotel

1138
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:14,319
network we're good to go

1139
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:16,270
but I'm guessing that if we can't the

1140
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,310
delta between what we need to do to make

1141
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:20,290
the remote participation work and what

1142
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:23,560
we're doing now for local participants

1143
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:26,710
isn't high enough to work Ted I'd like

1144
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:29,950
to follow up on one piece of that my

1145
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:33,640
experience with the Medeco folks in

1146
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:36,669
meetings is that the remote presenter

1147
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:39,100
does a test everything's fine

1148
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:42,010
you get in the meeting and it's Donald

1149
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:44,049
Duck right and I'm sorry you said it was

1150
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:46,990
Donald Duck that's all you hear is

1151
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:52,180
Donald buck talking right you the voice

1152
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:54,160
quality it's crap and we've seen this

1153
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:57,100
several times where where that's the

1154
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,980
case and when you start debugging it

1155
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:02,410
very often the problem is not in the

1156
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,390
hotel yeah very often it's actually on

1157
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:07,450
that participants right because they're

1158
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:09,730
trying to watch the thing and send video

1159
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:13,000
and audio and if they're in a

1160
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:15,370
constrained environment that's that that

1161
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,960
becomes an issue but the best we can do

1162
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:19,000
in a situation like that is make sure

1163
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,500
that we are not the constraints exactly

1164
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,610
that's where I was going before you say

1165
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:30,310
something I just wanted to from Mike

1166
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,200
from the jabber room to answer Colin's

1167
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,970
comment and this is from the Medeco team

1168
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,980
to answer Colin's comment I do agree

1169
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:38,080
that remote participation clients can

1170
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,210
work easily through Nets here at the

1171
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,700
IETF we deployed remote participation

1172
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:44,290
servers at the venue in order to

1173
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,620
minimize the delay and make it effective

1174
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:49,330
and having a WebRTC server behind in

1175
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:53,799
that is far from ideal in my humble

1176
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:58,980
opinion Colin chases that I think

1177
00:55:53,800 --> 00:56:02,530
agreement or at least understanding Glen

1178
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,880
funding of two points first I already

1179
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:06,990
noticed that in this conversation we're

1180
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,710
having we're muddling muddling together

1181
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,049
guest rooms

1182
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:13,000
and the meeting space and that's we're

1183
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:15,280
gonna try to capture the notes from this

1184
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,109
session and pull out meaningful like

1185
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,400
what people really need that's gonna

1186
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:20,770
make it really hard so I think we should

1187
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,990
all be really really careful when we say

1188
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,570
well you know hotel network went down

1189
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:26,859
the idea found what went down at the end

1190
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:29,349
of the video well you're actually you're

1191
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:32,619
medium doing work that's the guestroom

1192
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:34,030
network we were talking about and I also

1193
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:35,530
want to echo I really like the

1194
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:37,690
suggestion that we're talking about what

1195
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:40,210
we really need in terms of getting work

1196
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:41,680
done so what I'm sitting here it's

1197
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,900
really awesome if I consider and watch

1198
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,399
Netflix it's not an easy requirement

1199
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,570
it's actually probably better if I can't

1200
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,700
watch that foot since I'm gonna pay

1201
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,440
attention but email is a critical thing

1202
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,910
you need to do while you're here surf

1203
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,320
web pages to get information

1204
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:58,000
kristef hear the conversation it's

1205
00:56:53,320 --> 00:57:04,300
critical ad is needed to to clear

1206
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,890
discusses Adam Roach I wanted to speak a

1207
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,109
little more squarely to the question in

1208
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:10,480
front of the room and I have to say I'm

1209
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:13,210
I'm terrified by this prospect because I

1210
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,849
have memories of maastricht yeah where

1211
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:17,260
the guest rooms were utterly unusable

1212
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,910
and if that were replicated into the

1213
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,480
IETF meeting space everything would have

1214
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:25,450
ground to a halt and so I think that the

1215
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,790
answer to this is a resounding no but we

1216
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:29,890
I think there are probably and this was

1217
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:31,359
in a death I've apologized I'm not good

1218
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,879
with numbering name things in debt by a

1219
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:35,470
previous speaker along the lines of

1220
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,180
there are problems with the naps there

1221
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,529
are problems with the captive portals so

1222
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,560
that we're gonna have to probably go to

1223
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:43,030
the hotels and either vet those ahead of

1224
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,259
time that make certain they can handle

1225
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:46,839
the capacity we're going to throw at

1226
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,880
them or we need to speak to the hotels

1227
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:51,369
and say can we bypass these for the

1228
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:57,820
moment and and figure out some way that

1229
00:57:51,369 --> 00:58:00,430
we get the capacity that we need Bob Bob

1230
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,440
Hindon so to answer your question no I

1231
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:04,810
do not think the network provided by

1232
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,859
most those venues without enhancement is

1233
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:08,700
sufficient

1234
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:11,430
I'm particularly want to talk about ipv6

1235
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:14,939
never Bob just shocking I know

1236
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:18,160
but apparently someone has to say it

1237
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:20,380
will we will I think except maybe I've

1238
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,600
heard in Stockholm you can get ipv6 you

1239
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:26,530
know hotel we will never see this enemy

1240
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,690
and you know I think it among others I

1241
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:33,220
mean I actually use it many other people

1242
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:35,350
actually use it the message the ITF

1243
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,850
would be sending to the larger community

1244
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,160
that well we don't even think it's

1245
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:41,980
important anymore I mean might as well

1246
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:44,140
just roll this up and stop so I think

1247
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:46,570
this is very important that we continue

1248
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,700
doing this and building networks that

1249
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:52,210
support both protocols I mean I would be

1250
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:56,290
okay with turning off before but that's

1251
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:58,120
a little early for the rest of us so so

1252
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:00,009
no I don't think we should do this I

1253
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:06,250
don't think hotel then your networks are

1254
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:08,440
at all sufficient Singapore still in my

1255
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:10,330
comment yeah I just cannot get my work

1256
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,280
done without any issues I'm sitting on

1257
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:13,960
v6 on your network all the time so I'm

1258
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,540
not sure you do not need to get I could

1259
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,760
before to get my work done but if you

1260
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:21,070
want opinion here some people do need

1261
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,890
three six as a primary product so I

1262
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:25,840
don't see thank you they can you network

1263
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:28,890
without any enhancements can do that

1264
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:31,000
i I don't think we shall be using yeah

1265
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:39,339
Charles to be hold on we're gonna go to

1266
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:41,830
the remote cute Jim Martin to expect on

1267
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:43,480
an earlier point which was that the

1268
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:46,210
sometimes is not just the bandwidth and

1269
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,470
the the captive portal is being sure I'd

1270
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:50,040
like to expand on that a little bit

1271
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:53,230
internet we absolutely found repeatedly

1272
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:55,390
that the way that those those captive

1273
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:56,830
portals are set up the the madding that

1274
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:00,430
they do and the state that they maintain

1275
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:04,720
for that Matt doesn't scale to the ietf

1276
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:06,580
size and so the end result is that while

1277
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,680
you may have perfectly fine the

1278
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:11,440
available bandwidth both the forwarding

1279
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,529
capacity on the portal as well as the

1280
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,710
state capacity for nap are exhausted and

1281
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:19,090
you get some really weird failures and

1282
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:20,530
what we found in a number of scenarios

1283
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:22,900
actually we've there have been times in

1284
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:25,390
the past where we've used the bandwidth

1285
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,070
of the hotel but we've we've basically

1286
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:29,620
built our own infrastructure to support

1287
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:34,120
it and despite the fact that we're using

1288
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:36,580
their wires and their external link by

1289
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:39,310
putting in serious getting gear that is

1290
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,319
the gear we use is classic period stuff

1291
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:44,080
rather rather than enterprise style and

1292
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:47,680
if that makes a dramatic difference so

1293
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:50,020
when we when we talk about keeping the

1294
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,970
venue network as is and using it

1295
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,890
recognized it's not just a bandwidth

1296
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:55,720
issue it's it's largely you're gonna run

1297
01:00:53,890 --> 01:01:03,609
into problems with the state on the

1298
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:06,759
captive or the hackathon we've certainly

1299
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:10,570
benefited from having special requests

1300
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:14,440
that and the most common thing is just

1301
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:16,780
having lots of wire you know access and

1302
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,310
that I imagine most hotels could do to

1303
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,650
yes in advance

1304
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:22,480
the thing with prefix delegation I don't

1305
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:29,530
know I'm guessing less likely to get

1306
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:31,120
that you know ipv6 only we put in so

1307
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:34,210
that we could see what happens what

1308
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,950
breaks when so we could I mean I'd be

1309
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:38,230
sad if we had to live without those

1310
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:39,790
projects that took advantage of them so

1311
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:45,490
I really want to make sure that we did

1312
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:47,920
it probably to some extent ease David

1313
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:51,069
Sommers Harris so I had two comments one

1314
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:55,450
is just contributing to well you know

1315
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:57,430
what do we need list it's my my story is

1316
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,899
that I joined the ITF kind of just to

1317
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:02,200
learn and find out what it's all about

1318
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:04,420
and then got inspired by the whole ipv6

1319
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,040
story that's been going on and then my

1320
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:09,280
first reaction was well what about mine

1321
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:11,590
company does my stuff work over ipv6 try

1322
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,380
you know test the corporate VPN test our

1323
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:16,390
phone apps on various and if we had been

1324
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,830
using just the hotel network I wouldn't

1325
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,000
have been able to do that and I wouldn't

1326
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,980
have been able to start those

1327
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,480
conversations with the engineering teams

1328
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,670
within my company to say hey why don't

1329
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,950
we do this I think that is one of the

1330
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:29,650
objectives that the ITF is not just

1331
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:32,160
writing drafts but also I'm moving the

1332
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:34,540
wider community to adopt the

1333
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,180
implementations of the Giants so that

1334
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:39,870
was first comment the second one is I

1335
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,140
think the scope of the the users

1336
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:43,540
requirements

1337
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,700
maybe shouldn't be limited to just you

1338
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,259
know obviously networks mainly from

1339
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,210
getting work done at the

1340
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:51,820
conference but it does it has other

1341
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:54,100
impacts too like me right you talked

1342
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:55,900
about how Prague hotel actually probably

1343
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:58,390
upgraded infrastructure because of our

1344
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,690
networking background requirements so it

1345
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:03,040
has this kind of impact on

1346
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:06,190
implementations but also its messaging

1347
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,960
like Bob said like if we drop a BB six

1348
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:10,000
network then it kind of sends a message

1349
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,710
that we don't care anymore so I think

1350
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,510
you should think about not just the

1351
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,820
people using a network on site but also

1352
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:18,070
all the other objectives that the

1353
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:20,310
network helps the ITF achieve which on

1354
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:23,620
the ITF already has his objectives and

1355
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:26,250
how do you you probably look at those as

1356
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:29,259
requirements as well

1357
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:31,710
Jason looking good I think bearing in

1358
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:34,360
mind this is about the meeting room use

1359
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:38,470
the meeting space look the venue another

1360
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:39,820
hotel rooms I think maybe you know we're

1361
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:41,410
kind of past I don't know what other

1362
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,990
questions you have but I think kind of

1363
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:46,299
past you know I give me the network or

1364
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:48,100
not you know that's a simplistic binary

1365
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,750
question right and I think it's not

1366
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,370
really asking the important stuff which

1367
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,650
others have commented on a little bit

1368
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:55,390
which is what do you really need and how

1369
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:57,280
are those needs by our ties what are the

1370
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:59,980
most important things to the least

1371
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,620
important things on that list because

1372
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,750
that's where I think all of the

1373
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:07,089
difficulty often is with particular

1374
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:09,010
venues and with where we want to go in

1375
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:11,590
the future for this network I think most

1376
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:13,330
of us would say like yeah we need we

1377
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:15,130
have unique bandwidth requirements and

1378
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:18,040
imagine captive what if we know cause

1379
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:19,780
problems so I doubt anybody in the room

1380
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,220
here is gonna come up and say like no

1381
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:24,700
it's just used for all the meeting

1382
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:25,930
spaces I know yeah okay so what I'm

1383
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,490
saying is unfortunately we don't have

1384
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:35,859
the benefit of knowing all the questions

1385
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:38,229
next I think right I was trying to

1386
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:40,120
decide whether it was worth reminding

1387
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:42,100
everybody that we do have a set of

1388
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,200
questions venue question

1389
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:46,870
venue network questions Plus guest

1390
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:49,600
network questions and I was hoping we

1391
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:51,250
could defer that the guest room

1392
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,810
conversation until we got to that

1393
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:55,530
section of the conversation and just

1394
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:59,460
focus on the meeting space at this point

1395
01:04:55,530 --> 01:05:01,150
and with this I think we're done with

1396
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,710
you to go

1397
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:05,730
I cut the line for this question then

1398
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:08,049
move on sorry unless you have something

1399
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:09,490
like that maybe I should sit down for

1400
01:05:08,049 --> 01:05:11,349
the motion oldest customers I'm not

1401
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:13,029
specifically what immediately so I'm

1402
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:15,460
willing to believe that we have demands

1403
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:18,099
that are probably beyond what most when

1404
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:19,930
useful but I also believe that we've

1405
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:21,849
what we put in is way more than we

1406
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:24,308
actually need but I don't quite know

1407
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:26,079
where we are in terms of the spectrum

1408
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:27,700
right but it seems like we try to like

1409
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,799
painstakingly create this perfect

1410
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,509
network like it with architecture to the

1411
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:33,880
nine even that doesn't actually exist in

1412
01:05:31,509 --> 01:05:35,410
reality anywhere else but at the IHF

1413
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,099
agrees we have to hackathon the quick

1414
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,779
people-people right um the guy guy on

1415
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:43,240
jabber that said you know I ever I have

1416
01:05:40,779 --> 01:05:44,890
a local server out vo T ITF and in the

1417
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,598
guard yellow client said you know I'm

1418
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:48,578
sorry I can't catch us yeah you can it's

1419
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:49,690
it's it's not matter then and blew their

1420
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:52,569
mind right because that just doesn't

1421
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:54,519
exist anywhere else and and so it's nice

1422
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:56,920
that it exists but it comes with a cost

1423
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:58,598
right and so I'm on the executive

1424
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,160
committee of a Texaco which runs a bunch

1425
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:01,569
of conferences in their communications

1426
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,700
completely void of students and

1427
01:06:01,569 --> 01:06:05,200
professors there are not nearly as crazy

1428
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,569
as we are but they're not normal either

1429
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,160
and we don't pull our own network but we

1430
01:06:07,569 --> 01:06:10,720
go to the venue and say you know this is

1431
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,038
a demanding crowd you might want to get

1432
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,509
some more bandwidth you make sure you

1433
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:15,609
have enough IP addresses to head out

1434
01:06:13,509 --> 01:06:17,349
turn off your captive portal and we let

1435
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:18,578
them do it and oftentimes they do it

1436
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,019
sometimes they don't and then we

1437
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:23,410
complain on the first day and they fix

1438
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:25,629
it and it's but as willing to believe

1439
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:27,399
that the ITF isn't quite there yet but

1440
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:29,680
but I don't think we need all of them

1441
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,989
what the hell is is the RTP so everybody

1442
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,328
know I don't go to the slide here do we

1443
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:36,779
need one I don't know we need any one

1444
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:46,299
day room with a CRT piece over the truth

1445
01:06:36,779 --> 01:06:47,710
what is it why do we have one but it

1446
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:49,509
mean there's a bunch of stuff that we

1447
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:53,920
provided that I'm sure we actually don't

1448
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:55,480
need novels time on the knock James I'm

1449
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,509
not going excuse me can you directly to

1450
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:00,339
this but with the questions about could

1451
01:06:58,509 --> 01:07:04,720
we get by with or you know do you

1452
01:07:00,339 --> 01:07:08,170
acquire this I would recommend thinking

1453
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:10,899
also about just how painful it is to get

1454
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:13,119
by with in some cases for example for me

1455
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,480
we're actually getting my day job done

1456
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,190
one

1457
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,950
the critical protocol is a stage it's

1458
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,840
not actually anything else I can tell

1459
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:22,100
anything right but in some cases in

1460
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,600
order to get it done without a real

1461
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:26,150
network here to have to be three levels

1462
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,160
deep in SSH tunnels that get whacked by

1463
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,480
this then you pull it all up in three

1464
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,399
hours that kind of stuff

1465
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,290
so it's a question of how painful is it

1466
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,440
to get your job done how painful was it

1467
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:37,640
now look how often you spent watching

1468
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,210
the person over the front of rooms in

1469
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,859
ten minutes

1470
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:41,990
fiddling the damn projector to thicken

1471
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:46,730
the slides to come up how much worse is

1472
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:48,439
that katha kind of thing okay um I'm

1473
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:51,050
gonna interject a tiny bit right here

1474
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,360
one of the things that I mean I made an

1475
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:56,060
offhand remark earlier that I didn't

1476
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:58,010
that I wanted to use a slider tool and

1477
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:00,049
rust wouldn't mess wouldn't let me but I

1478
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,070
do think one of the the problems we're

1479
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:03,140
going to have through this conversation

1480
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:04,820
as most of these questions are not yes

1481
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,549
or no questions they're questions where

1482
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:09,320
you have a spectrum and so one of the

1483
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:11,750
things to be thinking in the back of

1484
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,730
your mind is I think after we had some

1485
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:16,609
conversations on this some sort of a

1486
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:18,260
detailed survey or some way of

1487
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:20,929
collecting better information from the

1488
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:23,150
community on you know how important is

1489
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,680
this to you and you guys are well-versed

1490
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:26,660
in these kind of things now you do these

1491
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:29,330
IETF surveys all the time is it not very

1492
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,889
important or very important so I mean I

1493
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:33,080
think you can think of this as the first

1494
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:35,720
pass through these questions and then

1495
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,130
you can help us develop what that survey

1496
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,360
would be going forward so that's the

1497
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:42,170
first thing outside the second thing is

1498
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:44,389
remember venue and then guestroom so but

1499
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:50,120
what I heard was trying to summarize is

1500
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:53,750
that we need to continue to offer v6 we

1501
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:56,050
need it that's aren't the worst thing if

1502
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:58,550
the address pool is big enough and

1503
01:08:56,050 --> 01:09:01,610
captive portals are a real pain in the

1504
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:04,120
butt that's what I heard I mean lots of

1505
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:06,349
other important details but the summary

1506
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,410
if you had to put it down in a few

1507
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:13,820
sentences if anyone disagrees with that

1508
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:16,819
please you know scream okay the next

1509
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:18,469
question I was gonna say this is the

1510
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:23,710
question might surprise for us because I

1511
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:27,470
put it on so this is was I was sort of a

1512
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:32,029
I'm curious I mean you all know what the

1513
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:33,710
rough distribution of the of the ietf

1514
01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:37,279
attendees are one of the conversations

1515
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:38,750
that we often have internally is you

1516
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,969
know are we only hearing from the people

1517
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:42,410
that are really verbal or are we are we

1518
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:43,670
really getting a sense of the whole

1519
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:45,200
community and that's why we ended up

1520
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:48,260
doing surveys so what I would like to do

1521
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,179
is ask for two hums the first one is do

1522
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:52,070
you think you are an average IHF

1523
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:54,380
attendee or are you somebody who's

1524
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:56,690
particularly passionate so question one

1525
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:58,880
hum if you think you are an average ietf

1526
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:04,040
attendee with average expectations for

1527
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:05,330
the network okay so then the second

1528
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,950
question is at home if you are

1529
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:10,880
particularly passionate about what you

1530
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:16,250
want the network to do for you so you

1531
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:21,620
guys all think your average okay so

1532
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:24,370
moving on to the next question that

1533
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,370
they're all liars

1534
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:30,440
Martin Thompson I'm really only here

1535
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:34,580
because I volunteered to do to monitor

1536
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:38,900
this for the Ivy self-selection bias is

1537
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:42,440
a real probably different so take that

1538
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,849
with a grain of salt play a little

1539
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:48,679
Cooper that was my favorite ham I've

1540
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:50,150
ever seen at the idea I like to offer

1541
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:53,390
that there is no such thing as an

1542
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:55,219
average ITF attendee so maybe yes part

1543
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:56,930
of the problem like if you've done user

1544
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:58,580
requirements or that kind of thing

1545
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:00,380
product management we have personas

1546
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:01,610
different types of us customers that

1547
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:03,230
you're looking at so probably you want

1548
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:05,630
to think about like what kinds of people

1549
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:08,110
come to the ITF like you have the ipv6

1550
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:13,480
folks that are gonna have very different

1551
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:13,480
average compared to any other category

1552
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:22,820
Jarrid much I think the fact that most

1553
01:11:18,349 --> 01:11:25,040
people in here or most other people in

1554
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,929
the IETF right now are not in here is

1555
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,869
actually a sign that what is working

1556
01:11:26,929 --> 01:11:32,210
right now is working relatively well yes

1557
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:33,559
you know I think that that is a thing

1558
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:36,320
and a few people who are super

1559
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,510
passionate or who have environments that

1560
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:41,719
are really amazing for them like Jen who

1561
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:43,699
has all ipv6 only and doesn't need v4 I

1562
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:46,280
think that's great for them but I think

1563
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:48,530
for the most part the network in the

1564
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:51,259
infrastructure is actually working well

1565
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:53,659
and that this isn't something that is

1566
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:56,170
very high on the list of things of you

1567
01:11:53,659 --> 01:11:58,250
there's a few of us who posted either

1568
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:01,190
conferences or provided connectivity

1569
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:03,290
before I'm sure Glen can comment on that

1570
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:05,119
or some other people who've done this

1571
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:06,949
before but for the most part this is

1572
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,630
working well it works relatively

1573
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:13,309
smoothly yeah I don't think we need a

1574
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:15,170
lot of the extra stuff but it's also a

1575
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:17,150
good opportunity for doing that I think

1576
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:18,619
we just need to make sure we beat back

1577
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:21,650
the requirements that people who want to

1578
01:12:18,619 --> 01:12:23,509
use the attendees here as a captive

1579
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:26,119
audience to perform an experiment

1580
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:28,190
because I actually have a day job I need

1581
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:30,429
to get done and I will ultimately revert

1582
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:32,869
to tethering off my phone if I have to

1583
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:34,400
you know if the network is down so I

1584
01:12:32,869 --> 01:12:35,960
think I think the fact that most people

1585
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,170
aren't here actually is a pretty good

1586
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,880
sign that you know and that only a few

1587
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:42,739
people hummed and said no I have very

1588
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,150
specialized requirements even in this

1589
01:12:42,739 --> 01:12:49,070
set I think is actually a very good sign

1590
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:50,509
funding I want to respond to Jared's

1591
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:51,860
come and kiss you I think you're

1592
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:53,230
absolutely right that do not and the

1593
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:56,299
network we have today is absolutely

1594
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:58,820
there's nothing that are any famous we

1595
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,699
are we have the pinnacle and they do a

1596
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:03,769
great job I will point out I think

1597
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:04,969
there's one of the motivators I think

1598
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:08,810
from some of this conversation in work

1599
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:10,610
is that we do have one problem that

1600
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:13,639
keeps turning back up and so and it's

1601
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:15,949
related to the venue selection so I

1602
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,510
chaired for about the past year the

1603
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:19,759
venue selection or the venue review pin

1604
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:21,139
and so we looked at a lot of the venues

1605
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,219
that you know Jim and the team would go

1606
01:13:21,139 --> 01:13:24,349
to site business for and they come back

1607
01:13:22,219 --> 01:13:27,679
and they will report here's venues that

1608
01:13:24,349 --> 01:13:28,639
look like and things the number one

1609
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,480
thing we reject

1610
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:34,610
then use over with network it was the

1611
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,379
the network infrastructure hotel wasn't

1612
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,519
after our standards or networking to

1613
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:39,409
structure the guest rooms wasn't after

1614
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,889
our standards for a variety of reasons

1615
01:13:39,409 --> 01:13:44,629
and that meant a lot of places got

1616
01:13:42,889 --> 01:13:46,460
rejected that potentially we could go do

1617
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:48,139
that and that's part of I think an

1618
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:50,480
important part of this equation as we

1619
01:13:48,139 --> 01:13:53,750
look through it especially when we get

1620
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:56,209
into places that are not like cheer once

1621
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:59,260
big a tier 1 cities in North America or

1622
01:13:56,210 --> 01:14:05,179
in Europe we have a lot of problems

1623
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:07,250
we're gonna go to gym next yeah my

1624
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:11,330
recollection is different than what you

1625
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:13,820
start describing I we having been in

1626
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:16,699
that role for for such a long time I we

1627
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:18,920
did in fact reject some locations

1628
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:21,980
particularly in Japan based upon the

1629
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:23,719
base upon Network however almost always

1630
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:26,690
there was a direct correlation between

1631
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:29,330
the infrastructure not being sufficient

1632
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:30,949
and the infrastructure and the rest of

1633
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:33,530
the pieces that were necessary to host

1634
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:34,549
an IETF meeting there were not we're not

1635
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:39,050
a good fit

1636
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:41,989
and so I I can count probably on one

1637
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:44,690
hand maybe maybe two hands over the last

1638
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:47,980
10 15 years the the number of sites

1639
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:50,928
where Marcia carrot rather Marcia

1640
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:52,339
Stephanie and Laura had said yes this is

1641
01:14:50,929 --> 01:14:53,570
where I want to go and I'm like sorry we

1642
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:55,969
we can't do it because we don't have

1643
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:58,009
network infrastructure and also I'd like

1644
01:14:55,969 --> 01:15:00,949
to expand on that just a hair and say

1645
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:04,850
that it's very common for us to say the

1646
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:08,599
site isn't acceptable as is however if

1647
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:11,179
you do X and sometimes X is instance

1648
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,190
tall some fiber or X is install an

1649
01:15:11,179 --> 01:15:16,190
additional copper run into it into a

1650
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:19,519
meeting room then we can come and that

1651
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:21,469
has been successful repeatedly in fact

1652
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,330
we were commenting on the infrastructure

1653
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:24,889
in Prague being better well there's a

1654
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:26,780
lot of fiber that's that's in Prague

1655
01:15:24,889 --> 01:15:28,360
that we that didn't exist there before

1656
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:30,469
and it dramatically has improved our

1657
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:33,049
deployment there and that was because we

1658
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:35,449
said hey this is a great place except

1659
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:37,460
we've got this issue we during the sales

1660
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:40,759
cycle we got it added into the contract

1661
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:42,560
that they would add fiber and it all

1662
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,530
worked out so um

1663
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,210
I call into question the assertion that

1664
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:49,960
we've been rejecting things primarily

1665
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,960
because the network

1666
01:15:52,899 --> 01:15:59,619
go ahead Wendy 131 clarification I

1667
01:15:57,139 --> 01:16:03,469
didn't say is the primary reason I

1668
01:15:59,619 --> 01:16:06,049
wasn't like the funky Jimmy I really am

1669
01:16:03,469 --> 01:16:08,869
but well and we look at sort of like

1670
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:11,179
what what was the higher reasons more

1671
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:11,539
often not the primary reason it was like

1672
01:16:11,179 --> 01:16:13,369
you

1673
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:16,688
ninety-nine percent of the time but of

1674
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:19,608
all the various reasons the network was

1675
01:16:16,689 --> 01:16:22,309
very often one of the key or the key

1676
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:27,169
reasonable objective in just like

1677
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:28,969
clarification large I think we could

1678
01:16:27,169 --> 01:16:31,879
give the seals the over-engineering up

1679
01:16:28,969 --> 01:16:34,459
we could probably provide quite a bit

1680
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:35,780
less and and still nobody would be in

1681
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:38,179
this room because it would still all be

1682
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:39,800
fine and I think that is sort of my

1683
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:41,269
concern right it's not that the network

1684
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,609
isn't good the network is awesome right

1685
01:16:41,269 --> 01:16:45,079
don't get me wrong and it could be half

1686
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:46,729
as awesome it would still be way better

1687
01:16:45,079 --> 01:16:47,539
than anywhere else I go in Chapel and I

1688
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:50,419
just do fine

1689
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:52,699
but it mean and the same reason in right

1690
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:54,858
at the seam so yup our bar what we

1691
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:57,259
accept is so high that it excludes a lot

1692
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:59,719
of things that work places I meet you

1693
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:03,109
always have to same venues and it's it

1694
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:05,119
costs money right and that's the concern

1695
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:06,739
right obviously I want to be able to you

1696
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,629
know the IDF's the one place where I can

1697
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:10,339
run search but then you do my laptop

1698
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:12,769
certificate because it's the only place

1699
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:14,479
where actually having before it that is

1700
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:17,510
another nice I can do it a few times a

1701
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:19,339
year do I need to know so I really think

1702
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:20,989
we need to look at what do we actually

1703
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:22,639
leave like Holland's that and what do we

1704
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:25,089
have and I think what we have is is way

1705
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:27,859
more to me

1706
01:17:25,089 --> 01:17:31,010
hi I'm Bobby indeed Jarvis also involved

1707
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:33,649
in the meeting selection and you know

1708
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:35,300
most agree with everything Jim said I

1709
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,969
mean the other way to think about it is

1710
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:40,399
the net the venues that were rejected

1711
01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:43,219
because of the network that the existing

1712
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:44,959
network infrastructure those would be if

1713
01:17:43,219 --> 01:17:46,969
you weren't building your own network

1714
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:48,619
that would be the last place you want to

1715
01:17:46,969 --> 01:17:51,729
go because that network is just going to

1716
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:51,728
suck all the time

1717
01:17:55,170 --> 01:18:00,929
hi Hans Khun na comes here something I

1718
01:17:59,489 --> 01:18:03,030
think we should keep in mind as we talk

1719
01:18:00,929 --> 01:18:05,820
about scaling back the services that we

1720
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:07,710
offer is that I think that's a good idea

1721
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:10,860
I think simple claims always good but we

1722
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:14,610
reach a critical threshold where if we

1723
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:17,730
don't have a volunteer team and we don't

1724
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:20,400
have a contract services team or 100%

1725
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:22,409
reliant on what the folks do and there's

1726
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,449
there's got to be a certain minimum

1727
01:18:22,409 --> 01:18:27,179
amount of services that didn't be

1728
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:28,500
interesting to provide and at which

1729
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:30,060
point it's really easy to provide

1730
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,980
additional services so some of what

1731
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:34,590
we're seeing is the fact that we have

1732
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,669
really good team who's here who finds

1733
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,989
things that are interesting to do

1734
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:39,179
because somebody comes in and says

1735
01:18:36,989 --> 01:18:41,509
wouldn't it be great if we did x and

1736
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:44,010
we're responsive if we're not on site

1737
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:46,170
none of that is possible and so I think

1738
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:48,750
you know this is not a binary function

1739
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:51,030
but it does reach a point where you're

1740
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:52,380
not providing enough additional value at

1741
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:57,690
which point you say we're just going to

1742
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:59,760
use whatever the hotel provides so

1743
01:18:57,690 --> 01:19:01,379
weren't marios enough um Jeff it's

1744
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,449
somewhat following onion for my concept

1745
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:07,550
yes we didn't understand what are they

1746
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:07,549
looking like sure here we go

1747
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:14,309
singing shortly so kind of following up

1748
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:16,230
on what Han said yes we definitely want

1749
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:18,179
to understand what people use what they

1750
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:20,519
need you know what we're over building

1751
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:21,989
but there is some amount of once we've

1752
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:24,090
got the base stuff set in place

1753
01:19:21,989 --> 01:19:27,718
additional services aren't always that

1754
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:30,179
hard track so serve smtp was an example

1755
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:32,429
once the base network has worked at it

1756
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:34,409
you know it's graded heading SMTP is not

1757
01:19:32,429 --> 01:19:36,480
that hard so there's sort of a large

1758
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:37,500
hump to get over then there's some

1759
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,549
additional stuff

1760
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,619
beautifully actually know what the

1761
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:42,300
additional stuff is we don't need but

1762
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:45,389
it's not you know one service costs you

1763
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:52,199
x2 services costs you 2x there's a base

1764
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:55,830
of that incremental also not volunteer

1765
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:58,080
to two different things on the on the

1766
01:19:55,830 --> 01:20:01,260
show floor side

1767
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:03,420
echoing something Charles said I come

1768
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:05,940
from an academic research and academic

1769
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:06,940
networking background where the stuff

1770
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:11,440
that's

1771
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:13,690
is is similar to some of the things that

1772
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,879
we are trying to offer and I think the

1773
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:19,299
idea of experiments and eating your own

1774
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,980
dog can all tie into that in the Hans is

1775
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,580
talking about the interesting problems

1776
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:24,339
of salt

1777
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:30,880
the next thing I would hate to see us

1778
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:33,730
lose that on Bruce if Venu selection

1779
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:37,870
really is like like a burning question

1780
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:40,860
for some people we have a we have an

1781
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:44,140
experiment we can run and Singapore

1782
01:20:40,860 --> 01:21:01,420
venues already selected we've been there

1783
01:20:44,140 --> 01:21:03,420
before entering I think we just had a

1784
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:06,400
mic drop

1785
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:08,920
Ted hurting no there's a much meaner AV

1786
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,719
network test you can run is there there

1787
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:15,580
are actually two hotels in Singapore

1788
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:17,860
that are connected to the venue randomly

1789
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:21,100
assigned people to the hotels with the

1790
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:23,500
ietf network for the not so much ietf

1791
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:26,920
network and collect your data that's a B

1792
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:29,620
Network test Ted has nailed it but he

1793
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:31,810
hasn't gone far enough to allow people

1794
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:34,090
to bid and see how much they would pay

1795
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:40,600
to be in which hotel and then we'd have

1796
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:42,970
Dave this is very interesting when this

1797
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:48,670
whole thing started you know are you

1798
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:49,900
passionate that was yeah so my name is

1799
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:52,270
Tim Sheppard I've been there a lot of

1800
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:53,980
IETF meetings and I thought well we just

1801
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:55,360
had this problem in Maastricht and then

1802
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:55,929
I looked at that Maastricht was nine

1803
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,809
years ago

1804
01:21:55,930 --> 01:22:00,730
yeah and I'm fully prepared to believe

1805
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:02,500
that hotels have upgraded their networks

1806
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:04,660
since then and maybe they're poor

1807
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:07,710
captive portals and their DHCP things

1808
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:10,660
are better but I didn't have that myself

1809
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:13,780
so and I I know you're wanted to

1810
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:15,639
separate the venue and the hotel rooms

1811
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:17,710
but it could be the same I mean I would

1812
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,300
expect the same issues and if we just

1813
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:20,000
use the hotel's infrastructure of

1814
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:23,240
meeting room

1815
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,590
and have to go through there yes I'm not

1816
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,849
cutting you off what I'm doing is for

1817
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:28,010
all of those people going to the mic

1818
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:30,650
right now look but let me point out that

1819
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:33,350
we're only on question number three and

1820
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:37,940
so do you really want to talk about how

1821
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:44,270
passionate you are yeah oh that's

1822
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:46,700
actually so is it possible for us to

1823
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:52,300
figure out whether a hotel's network is

1824
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:52,300
adequate before we go there I don't know

1825
01:22:56,230 --> 01:23:01,849
so sad yes yeah so sadly I don't really

1826
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:03,230
think it is we had something I can't

1827
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:06,590
remember where but it wasn't that long

1828
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:08,570
ago where we went into a hotel we told

1829
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:10,010
them it was an overflow hotel we told

1830
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:12,259
them they're going to be a bunch of ietf

1831
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:15,010
people arriving and she please upgrade

1832
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:18,440
their network so it would be ready and

1833
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:20,090
then we ITF participants arrived that

1834
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,799
did not work well and they kept

1835
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:24,250
complaining that we were attacking the

1836
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,840
network and that's why it wasn't working

1837
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:29,330
what a wreck she was just that's what an

1838
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:30,710
IETF person looks like I don't really

1839
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:33,710
think that there's a way for us to tell

1840
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:35,840
ahead of time if the network is gonna

1841
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:39,100
survive without having a lot of people

1842
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:42,140
doing a lot of stuff the issue isn't

1843
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:44,120
doesn't seem to usually be bandwidth the

1844
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:45,560
issue seems to be capture portal stuff

1845
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:48,170
that wasn't fully understood weird

1846
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:50,330
generalization unusual internal

1847
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:53,030
infrastructure weird configuration for

1848
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:55,340
broadcast settings things like that

1849
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:57,200
so yes it's entirely possible that in

1850
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:00,020
some locations the hotel network would

1851
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:02,870
work I think it would be very sad if we

1852
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:04,760
were to arrive and then discover that it

1853
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:07,120
wasn't right because then we're really

1854
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,120
stuck

1855
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:12,770
David this comment probably should be

1856
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:15,230
for any guest network related question

1857
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:17,960
coming later but I just wanna point out

1858
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:21,549
I noticed that the hotel network here if

1859
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:24,590
you want to use it cost $20 per day for

1860
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:26,480
their cheapest option and then also if

1861
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:27,920
you want to get LTE SIM card the

1862
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:31,549
cheapest I could find was fifty dollars

1863
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,590
so it's I'm enjoying the idea hotel I

1864
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:35,300
think that there is a difference but

1865
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:37,070
just just as a side note there's a

1866
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:39,679
difference between us replacing the

1867
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:42,679
network in us negotiate negotiating into

1868
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:44,360
the hotel contract that access to their

1869
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:46,849
network is free so I wouldn't

1870
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:48,940
necessarily look at the cost in that

1871
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:51,230
parameter

1872
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:52,309
listen Cooper yeah I I think the

1873
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:54,440
contracts are actually quite relevant

1874
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:55,880
here both for the case that you raised

1875
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,428
Warren because I don't know if there was

1876
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:01,099
a contract with the overflow hotel that

1877
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:03,020
included anything about the network so

1878
01:25:01,099 --> 01:25:04,159
so we contacted with them and they

1879
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,780
agreed that they were gonna upgrade the

1880
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:16,070
network and then they didn't do it is

1881
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:17,210
that what you're saying okay okay it

1882
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:18,590
just seems a little odd to me like we

1883
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:19,849
fly people around the world to do site

1884
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:21,199
visits then you say well we can't really

1885
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:22,670
tell in advance whether things are gonna

1886
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:26,269
work or not like what was the point of

1887
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:27,710
the site visit so I think we can tell

1888
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:30,530
something because we obviously take

1889
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:32,449
hotels off of the list if they're if

1890
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:33,889
they don't meet some criteria so there

1891
01:25:32,449 --> 01:25:37,369
must be something there anyway we don't

1892
01:25:33,889 --> 01:25:40,760
need to continue but but also with

1893
01:25:37,369 --> 01:25:43,460
respect to the contracts I I would be a

1894
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:45,260
quite nervous about us having put a lot

1895
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:46,520
of effort into contracting for something

1896
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,679
and then saying we're gonna run an

1897
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,830
experiment and not use it so like in

1898
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:53,840
Singapore like I you know our our

1899
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:55,820
diligent staff put a lot of effort

1900
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,590
presumably into negotiating with that

1901
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,559
hotel so that we could take over the

1902
01:25:57,590 --> 01:26:01,880
network in the guest rooms and I feel

1903
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,130
like we should honor that by providing

1904
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:06,290
that service to the attendees as opposed

1905
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:08,060
to you know for half the people turn it

1906
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:10,580
off so I think we probably need to find

1907
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:14,119
other ways of experimenting maybe that

1908
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:15,619
don't include like gently backing down

1909
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:20,630
from the things that we've put work into

1910
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:22,400
contracting for that Orochi good I

1911
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:23,869
wanted to see quickly to Tim's point

1912
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,489
because he referenced the moss tree

1913
01:26:23,869 --> 01:26:26,449
comment that I made and I want to go

1914
01:26:25,489 --> 01:26:29,239
ahead and throw something a little more

1915
01:26:26,449 --> 01:26:31,848
time local so last Thursday and Friday I

1916
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:34,730
was in hotel in DC obviously admin

1917
01:26:31,849 --> 01:26:35,869
instrument by the IETF and I mean we're

1918
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:37,820
talking irrelevantly nice hotel the

1919
01:26:35,869 --> 01:26:41,000
Hilton property the exact one escapes my

1920
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:45,769
memory and network there I was getting

1921
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,119
around 3 Mbps and actively used SSL

1922
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,949
tunnels were going down every

1923
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:52,459
thirty minutes I didn't really have time

1924
01:26:48,949 --> 01:26:54,228
to diagnose why but I mean this is kind

1925
01:26:52,459 --> 01:26:57,949
of my impression of state of the art

1926
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:59,570
what exists in hotels today and which is

1927
01:26:57,949 --> 01:27:01,728
why when the question was put up as to

1928
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:04,159
whether that would be okay is like no

1929
01:27:01,729 --> 01:27:06,050
it's not okay even when the ITF isn't

1930
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:09,110
there in many cases and again we're

1931
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:19,070
talking like nice Hilton properties not

1932
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:20,780
like your leave act motels Boston not

1933
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:22,219
volunteer very good response to the

1934
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,259
different comments and one maybe I

1935
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:25,909
haven't know changing the subject um

1936
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:27,619
several people have pointed out that if

1937
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:29,179
the network then you must screwed up

1938
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:31,999
enough you just revert to tethered to

1939
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:33,769
their phones and that's sort of true but

1940
01:27:31,999 --> 01:27:35,599
they're scheming issues might want to

1941
01:27:33,769 --> 01:27:37,489
think about what it really boils down to

1942
01:27:35,599 --> 01:27:39,439
it was I believe meeting if you tethered

1943
01:27:37,489 --> 01:27:40,938
you have thought I would invite you to

1944
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:42,619
conduct a thought experiment of twelve

1945
01:27:40,939 --> 01:27:48,079
hundred people each tethered to their

1946
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:50,539
phone in the plenary I match up again um

1947
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:52,188
I just want to get into the can we

1948
01:27:50,539 --> 01:27:54,469
predict that what would work or not

1949
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:56,599
having done in several site visits

1950
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:59,179
myself and again being this possible

1951
01:27:56,599 --> 01:28:01,489
thing here I can tell you that sometimes

1952
01:27:59,179 --> 01:28:05,780
we can clearly tell that a network will

1953
01:28:01,489 --> 01:28:08,030
not withstand even the quarter of it ITF

1954
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:10,398
and he or attendees or will walk at all

1955
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:12,739
so the negative case is easy to detect

1956
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:14,149
sometimes we find networks that are very

1957
01:28:12,739 --> 01:28:16,339
well built like this one in here that

1958
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:19,039
wipe the actual coverage the wife the

1959
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:21,349
radio coverage is quite good still after

1960
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,300
day one we found a problem that there

1961
01:28:21,349 --> 01:28:25,159
was something somewhere deep birth in

1962
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:27,679
their network that said no there's a way

1963
01:28:25,159 --> 01:28:29,688
too many broadcast packets here and

1964
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:33,079
we're going to shut down course for four

1965
01:28:29,689 --> 01:28:34,280
minutes and this this we cannot this

1966
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:36,169
became our predict during the site visit

1967
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,360
site visit it's usually a small team

1968
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:40,599
four or five six people maybe it most

1969
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:43,879
and we cannot simulate

1970
01:28:40,599 --> 01:28:46,129
612 on our even 100 ITF entities but

1971
01:28:43,879 --> 01:28:47,899
sometimes we can see I've been to once

1972
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:50,119
where I can tell okay the network

1973
01:28:47,899 --> 01:28:55,249
soceity doesn't even work with me alone

1974
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:56,929
now let alone I tip so yes we can

1975
01:28:55,249 --> 01:28:59,530
predict them in a negative case but not

1976
01:28:56,929 --> 01:28:59,530
impossible

1977
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:06,010
yeah yeah at Sol's um what's it cost

1978
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,409
like what's the incremental cost roughly

1979
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:10,750
in terms of people hours contract

1980
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:13,599
negotiation and then operational costs

1981
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:19,150
to have the hotel versus do not have the

1982
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:20,800
hotel I don't you know I don't know we

1983
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:23,440
have those numbers on hand now but if it

1984
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,719
says oh it took us a week four people we

1985
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:29,500
haven't seen before to give us access to

1986
01:29:25,719 --> 01:29:33,550
their hotel and or it costs you know no

1987
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:38,199
extra time just another free dental

1988
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:40,780
so cost did come up as a consideration

1989
01:29:38,199 --> 01:29:42,040
in this so we've started looking at some

1990
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:45,909
of the numbers but one of the things we

1991
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:47,650
specifically wanted to do was to ask

1992
01:29:45,909 --> 01:29:50,080
feedback from the community and what the

1993
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:51,849
requirements were and then take a look

1994
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,590
at this is what you're asking for this

1995
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:55,239
is what it cost how they get balanced

1996
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:56,800
and so we specifically I don't have

1997
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:59,379
numbers to give you at this point I've

1998
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:03,580
looked at some numbers but nothing in

1999
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:05,890
detail but I think the the challenge

2000
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:08,230
here is the cost between real dollars we

2001
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:10,449
pay out versus cost in kind and then

2002
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:11,919
also resource like people resources and

2003
01:30:10,449 --> 01:30:14,710
I just think that we're probably better

2004
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:16,210
off focusing technically today and then

2005
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:18,820
considering in the next steps how to

2006
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:21,460
deal with the cost and actually handing

2007
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:24,009
it off to the people I mean we have we

2008
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:26,320
have an LLC that that that is

2009
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:27,699
established to to look at budgets and to

2010
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:31,330
look at all of those kinds of things and

2011
01:30:27,699 --> 01:30:33,549
perhaps we as the technical team

2012
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:40,780
shouldn't be doing that to it to a large

2013
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:42,580
extent well I'm part of this is where I

2014
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:45,040
wanted to look at the sliders of how

2015
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:46,480
important is this you know if it's if

2016
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:50,530
it's easy to do and doesn't cost

2017
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:53,650
anything versus okay move it along so

2018
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:56,110
Warren Warren quarry somewhat responding

2019
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:59,469
to I think Adams plate so as part of the

2020
01:30:56,110 --> 01:31:00,460
NOC team we arrived before we started

2021
01:30:59,469 --> 01:31:02,890
setting up the network

2022
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:05,050
and so for the last meeting in Prague I

2023
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:07,270
arrived and they made FaceTime cause my

2024
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:09,010
wife can can I stop you for a minute I

2025
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:10,750
think we've established that the network

2026
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:11,780
is improved are we gonna make a point

2027
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:14,540
beyond that

2028
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:16,550
yeah lachchi is it usable at all I mean

2029
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:19,730
I can do it later okay it's just where

2030
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:24,500
we're at we got 30 minutes left

2031
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:26,419
can I can I see your next slide so the

2032
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:28,190
next one is do we need ipv6 and I think

2033
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:29,870
we probably can I recommend you just

2034
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,980
show all of your slides so people know

2035
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:35,380
what's coming and they can get their

2036
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:38,809
comments the most appropriate place okay

2037
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:40,610
okay so we had do need ipv6 and then the

2038
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:42,170
next one is our attendees okay with

2039
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:44,900
being fully exposed and this is sort of

2040
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:46,850
the you know we've you know do you want

2041
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:49,429
full network or do you want some client

2042
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:51,350
protection next what are your

2043
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:53,360
expectations for security and privacy on

2044
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:55,340
the network this is whether you expect

2045
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:57,110
the network to provide you security and

2046
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:58,490
protect you or whether you are willing

2047
01:31:57,110 --> 01:32:02,330
to do it all yourself

2048
01:31:58,490 --> 01:32:06,290
next how reliable does this network need

2049
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:08,030
to be I mean we we have a lot of

2050
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:10,550
complexity and a lot of cost associated

2051
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:17,540
with reliability and it's not you know

2052
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:19,100
how do how do we manage that next oh you

2053
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:21,380
did sorry how reliable does a remote

2054
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:22,550
participation need to be in a sense that

2055
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:24,410
there's a difference between the network

2056
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:28,520
going in here versus that folks being

2057
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:29,960
able to get in next how important is

2058
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:33,620
network to support hackathon and

2059
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:35,240
community driven experiments next how

2060
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:38,440
important is to eat your own dog food I

2061
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:42,050
think lucy alluded to that earlier next

2062
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:43,879
this is the terminal room question is it

2063
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:46,130
still important to provide a quiet space

2064
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,690
or not with wired connection the

2065
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:51,920
occasional wired connections and power

2066
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:57,559
next we're not going to get to this to

2067
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:58,820
that in some ways we answer both some of

2068
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:03,410
those other ones have been touched on

2069
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:05,389
but this one has uses your last slide no

2070
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:07,370
it's actually not Venu slaw that's the

2071
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:09,310
last Venu slide and then we have guest

2072
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:12,500
dress guest room network questions and

2073
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:15,020
this one was basically the you know the

2074
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,610
ietf hotel or a default well known as

2075
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:18,050
this ID how important is it to you that

2076
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:19,339
you arrive on site you open up your

2077
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:22,090
laptop and you don't have to do anything

2078
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:22,090
on the network works

2079
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:27,150
I think we have beat this one to death

2080
01:33:25,409 --> 01:33:28,320
already I think we have distinguished

2081
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:36,809
between the venue network and the

2082
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:37,980
guestroom Network and what you all asked

2083
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:44,219
me to finish the slide so I'm just gonna

2084
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:45,629
go through them this is the without any

2085
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:47,369
hints enhancements which we spend a lot

2086
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,719
of time discussing this is one we have

2087
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:50,909
not spent a lot of time discussing

2088
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,710
because it also implies some limitations

2089
01:33:50,909 --> 01:33:54,598
it's is it acceptable to default to the

2090
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:57,060
regional filtering constraints on the

2091
01:33:54,599 --> 01:33:59,340
guest guest room network and this is one

2092
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:00,719
of the questions of one of the impacts

2093
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,300
of depending on where we go whether we

2094
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,500
take over the guest room network or not

2095
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:07,290
and then we're not going to get to more

2096
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:09,449
in-depth questions next steps so that's

2097
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:12,360
all the slides they are up on the data

2098
01:34:09,449 --> 01:34:14,489
tracker so we are going to skip over

2099
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:19,739
ipv6 I think the general consensus is we

2100
01:34:14,489 --> 01:34:23,360
need it and so you all have seen all the

2101
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:26,790
questions now so you can queue up hi

2102
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:29,400
Sharon Moss again I I think I think for

2103
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:31,260
me there is a very important thing very

2104
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:33,869
important thing to keep in mind which is

2105
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:35,699
that as the guest room access has

2106
01:34:33,869 --> 01:34:38,190
improved at the different conferences

2107
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:39,750
that I've participated in I need to go

2108
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:41,759
to the terminal room engage with

2109
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:44,820
terminal room or a common space and

2110
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:47,040
24-hour access of that space has changed

2111
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:50,429
I suspect there's some room for a slider

2112
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:52,230
there where if for contractual reasons

2113
01:34:50,429 --> 01:34:54,780
it may be difficult or impossible to

2114
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:57,059
take over the hotel network I remember I

2115
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:58,440
think in Atlanta there was some property

2116
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:00,150
where they didn't want us to take it

2117
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:03,839
over and run it the same SSID or

2118
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:07,230
something many many years ago in those

2119
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:10,590
cases we can balance I think on the per

2120
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:13,138
meeting basis the private space that

2121
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:15,810
people have versus going to the public

2122
01:35:13,139 --> 01:35:17,400
space and being able to work a number

2123
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:19,110
I've seen a number of people doing video

2124
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:21,030
conferences and stuff out here in the

2125
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:22,739
common space it probably would be better

2126
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:25,469
if they could do it in their room but

2127
01:35:22,739 --> 01:35:27,570
that is I think a balance between the

2128
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:29,300
environment and you know people need to

2129
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:31,860
balance their own job requirements and

2130
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:33,540
if ITF isn't their main thing that

2131
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,978
they're doing which in my case happens

2132
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:35,840
to not

2133
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:37,369
sometimes they may have to do that other

2134
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,340
work and so just providing the ability

2135
01:35:37,369 --> 01:35:42,799
for them to get that work done or or

2136
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:44,510
informing them no we are not going to do

2137
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,969
that you need to make your own

2138
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:48,559
arrangements and being relatively clear

2139
01:35:46,969 --> 01:35:50,659
about what we're gonna do there I think

2140
01:35:48,559 --> 01:35:54,920
I think there is a slider there and I

2141
01:35:50,659 --> 01:35:56,690
believe it can vary meeting to me just a

2142
01:35:54,920 --> 01:36:00,050
tiny follow up on that that used to be

2143
01:35:56,690 --> 01:36:02,808
our you know the when we used to not do

2144
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:04,849
the venue thing but not not do the guest

2145
01:36:02,809 --> 01:36:06,920
room Network the point used to be that

2146
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:10,429
people needed to be able to go somewhere

2147
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:12,170
to get 24-hour access and if if the

2148
01:36:10,429 --> 01:36:13,639
hotel network wasn't augmented and it

2149
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:14,989
was a terminal room when it was a space

2150
01:36:13,639 --> 01:36:18,440
like that and that was a different

2151
01:36:14,989 --> 01:36:20,329
consideration I've got to do so on the

2152
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:21,799
terminal room I think the fact that

2153
01:36:20,329 --> 01:36:25,099
people continue to go there and use it

2154
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,749
there they're funny useless and so I

2155
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:27,979
think we have a simple test without what

2156
01:36:26,749 --> 01:36:29,659
you look at the room and see if people

2157
01:36:27,979 --> 01:36:31,249
are going there and if they are it's

2158
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:33,469
something that they need they probably

2159
01:36:31,249 --> 01:36:37,849
don't need VT to be 52 or beat you with

2160
01:36:33,469 --> 01:36:40,510
under terminals in the bill and on the

2161
01:36:37,849 --> 01:36:42,229
the other questions

2162
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:43,610
people through the slots very quickly

2163
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:50,059
that was what I wanted to cover top that

2164
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:52,369
they up on the dog food I think the dog

2165
01:36:50,059 --> 01:36:53,630
food question is is very relevant and I

2166
01:36:52,369 --> 01:36:56,299
think it is something we should you need

2167
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:58,639
to do and it we've learnt a lot we

2168
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:00,650
continue to learn a lot and as a sort of

2169
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,300
a thought leader of how networks should

2170
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:03,799
be designed for a public health

2171
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:06,769
perspective it's very good for the ITF

2172
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:10,300
to to get its feet wet and sometimes I

2173
01:37:06,769 --> 01:37:10,300
hope photography doesn't taste very good

2174
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:16,119
so not in Thompson I wanted to talk

2175
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:18,409
about the sort of security things here

2176
01:37:16,119 --> 01:37:19,848
but you asked the question are people

2177
01:37:18,409 --> 01:37:21,589
comfortable with being exposed

2178
01:37:19,849 --> 01:37:25,340
I heard someone behind me say well

2179
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:26,989
you're already exposed I the idea been

2180
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,159
talking about writing a document that

2181
01:37:26,989 --> 01:37:30,409
basically says if you're on a network

2182
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:31,670
considered consider the internet threat

2183
01:37:30,409 --> 01:37:34,400
novelist as the thing that you're

2184
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:37,369
operating with I personally don't want

2185
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,978
to have a network helping I found that

2186
01:37:37,369 --> 01:37:41,900
in every case where where a network is

2187
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:45,439
helping their idea of all things

2188
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:46,259
different maybe right and I would rather

2189
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:48,470
that not happen

2190
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:52,110
we'll probably not spend resources on

2191
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:55,590
doing things like in network malware

2192
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:58,290
scanning and vendor likes so I think you

2193
01:37:55,590 --> 01:38:02,160
misunderstood the question partly in

2194
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:04,670
that hotel networks through various

2195
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:07,080
mechanisms think that are helping and

2196
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:09,000
we're turning it off today

2197
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:12,150
right there are tunnels guess when I say

2198
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,700
okay I don't want that happening now I'm

2199
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:16,730
not sure that I'm diehard on that

2200
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:20,900
particular point in the sense that you

2201
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:24,269
sorry I do not want someone helping me

2202
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:25,620
from the outside and I would prefer to

2203
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:27,900
be turned off but I don't think I'm

2204
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:31,470
gonna hold the line on that one because

2205
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:33,440
that's some networks do these things the

2206
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:35,970
other point I got up to to make was that

2207
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:37,620
filtering requirements vary by region

2208
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:42,210
and some of them are more onerous than

2209
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:44,370
others yeah and I don't think that the

2210
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:48,600
UK requirements are particularly bad at

2211
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:51,930
this point in time that we might debate

2212
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:53,910
the direction they're going and I do

2213
01:38:51,930 --> 01:39:01,140
find that some people find the first is

2214
01:38:53,910 --> 01:39:03,650
the requirements and we need to think

2215
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:06,480
about that on a daily basis

2216
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:08,759
Jason hey Jason looking good on the

2217
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:11,610
terminal room question I think the era

2218
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,980
of needing 24/7 access is probably past

2219
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:17,099
given connectivity in other public

2220
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:19,919
spaces and in the rooms but it might be

2221
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:22,770
interesting at the next meeting thinking

2222
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:25,470
of surveys like everybody coming into

2223
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:27,060
the terminal and for example why are you

2224
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:28,770
using the terminal room for how long

2225
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:30,630
like you know are there other spaces

2226
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:32,730
something somebody designed a circuit I

2227
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:34,650
understand why are they're using it what

2228
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:36,929
are their specific needs so that is

2229
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:40,620
better care Thanks this particular

2230
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:42,930
meeting I noticed one thing that was

2231
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:44,460
different people are not going to the

2232
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:47,280
terminal room to print their boarding

2233
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:49,380
passes because the printer is no longer

2234
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:53,309
in the terminal room it's now at the reg

2235
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:54,900
desk by Sean Turner um so I guess the

2236
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:57,969
pile on the turtle room

2237
01:39:54,900 --> 01:40:01,539
I can't even get wired access and

2238
01:39:57,969 --> 01:40:02,949
this thing so I don't know or that or

2239
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:06,369
iPads or whatever

2240
01:40:02,949 --> 01:40:08,259
also I I think there's ways we can

2241
01:40:06,369 --> 01:40:09,880
gracefully shut it down to two Clemens

2242
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:11,170
point like it's being used but we should

2243
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:15,369
say like do we really need to think this

2244
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:17,260
way forward in terms of guest network

2245
01:40:15,369 --> 01:40:19,598
access in the hotel like in my guest

2246
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:21,340
room I get back so late I mean I'm

2247
01:40:19,599 --> 01:40:22,780
working I'm checking my email but like I

2248
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:25,059
can deal with it for a little bit it

2249
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:27,249
doesn't work that's fine um so I really

2250
01:40:25,059 --> 01:40:30,039
don't think I need access like that

2251
01:40:27,249 --> 01:40:32,920
specialized superfast access in Jasper I

2252
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:34,869
think I could do without it and I'm in

2253
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:36,789
this hotel I can walk down right like

2254
01:40:34,869 --> 01:40:38,920
it's if you're in the venue Hotel like

2255
01:40:36,789 --> 01:40:40,449
walking outside your room and going down

2256
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,219
several flights of stairs it's not that

2257
01:40:40,449 --> 01:40:43,629
owners and at the end of the day isn't

2258
01:40:42,219 --> 01:40:46,030
it all about how we're talking together

2259
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:47,949
a being inside conversations in life we

2260
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:50,170
don't necessarily want everyone in in

2261
01:40:47,949 --> 01:40:55,388
their rooms holed up picking away in

2262
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:57,670
other words like do it and all kinds of

2263
01:40:55,389 --> 01:40:59,050
other acts so I think there's we could

2264
01:40:57,670 --> 01:41:03,510
definitely look at getting rid of the

2265
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:06,400
guest guest privacy don't need help

2266
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:08,229
I'm already I'm already trying to

2267
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,579
protect myself from everybody else and

2268
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:11,789
you're all my friends and I trust you a

2269
01:41:09,579 --> 01:41:11,789
lot

2270
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:16,449
just one one note on the terminal or

2271
01:41:14,499 --> 01:41:18,760
room I think we tried to word it

2272
01:41:16,449 --> 01:41:21,159
slightly differently is we're not so

2273
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:23,650
much asking about 24-hour access as is

2274
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:27,670
it valuable to have a quiet space with

2275
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:29,489
power as opposed to like lounges or

2276
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:32,679
sitting with your laptop somewhere

2277
01:41:29,489 --> 01:41:34,509
funding again so some more comments in

2278
01:41:32,679 --> 01:41:35,860
Kerala I like this I like Jason

2279
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:37,269
suggesting it's a really good one

2280
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:39,639
I don't what people are using what to do

2281
01:41:37,269 --> 01:41:41,380
again I will point out but based upon

2282
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:43,269
the different venues we go to this thing

2283
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:46,059
is awesome it has lots of public space

2284
01:41:43,269 --> 01:41:48,309
to sit down and type way up in other

2285
01:41:46,059 --> 01:41:49,749
places where we have far less seating

2286
01:41:48,309 --> 01:41:52,840
like we'll have open space but not as

2287
01:41:49,749 --> 01:41:54,610
many seats I often will if I'm in the

2288
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:56,139
hotel I'll sometimes drop in the

2289
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:58,960
terminal room just to get a table just

2290
01:41:56,139 --> 01:42:00,369
half way out so that's sort of we do

2291
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,260
that experiment we need you over a

2292
01:42:00,369 --> 01:42:03,728
couple different venues to get a bigger

2293
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:05,440
picture because there's some multiple

2294
01:42:03,729 --> 01:42:08,019
factors there the other factor I think

2295
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,969
is a lot of people Nate guess on my part

2296
01:42:08,019 --> 01:42:11,619
why they may be going there is that the

2297
01:42:09,969 --> 01:42:13,780
since a half-hour

2298
01:42:11,619 --> 01:42:17,169
or more don't stay at the conference

2299
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:18,728
hotel sorry the event Lavelle they might

2300
01:42:17,169 --> 01:42:20,919
be going there to do some work between

2301
01:42:18,729 --> 01:42:22,539
working group sessions it's just an

2302
01:42:20,919 --> 01:42:23,800
opportunity gotta get some work done cuz

2303
01:42:22,539 --> 01:42:26,289
they can't write up to their room and

2304
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,999
I'm Sean's point I fully agree I mean

2305
01:42:26,289 --> 01:42:29,860
even today I was in my room doing some

2306
01:42:27,999 --> 01:42:31,030
some slide stuff and I went you know

2307
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:33,699
what I don't need to be of our room

2308
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:35,139
doing some sly stuff I go downstairs do

2309
01:42:33,699 --> 01:42:36,638
some slide stuff maybe have an

2310
01:42:35,139 --> 01:42:38,139
opportunity to talk to some people that

2311
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,340
just happen to come by and they've

2312
01:42:38,139 --> 01:42:41,289
worked out really great I had seven

2313
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:47,409
great conversations I would not have had

2314
01:42:41,289 --> 01:42:49,959
I been locked away in my room bill

2315
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:53,489
phenomena volunteer I wanted to speak to

2316
01:42:49,959 --> 01:42:56,769
the outage tolerance question because as

2317
01:42:53,489 --> 01:43:01,388
things like the meeting materials have

2318
01:42:56,769 --> 01:43:03,489
evolved gotten better and as the network

2319
01:43:01,389 --> 01:43:06,429
has gotten better I've been very

2320
01:43:03,489 --> 01:43:08,589
surprised to see working with chairs at

2321
01:43:06,429 --> 01:43:12,249
the front of the room downloading the

2322
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:15,789
meeting materials like as presentations

2323
01:43:12,249 --> 01:43:17,889
are ready like not downloaded before not

2324
01:43:15,789 --> 01:43:20,860
downloading you know hours before not

2325
01:43:17,889 --> 01:43:24,760
even downloading minutes before is app

2326
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:27,459
on the map and so we've kind of evolved

2327
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:32,409
into a place where that workflow works

2328
01:43:27,459 --> 01:43:34,179
and if we are going to say we have high

2329
01:43:32,409 --> 01:43:36,419
tolerance for outages then we need to

2330
01:43:34,179 --> 01:43:38,739
make sure that that workflow is

2331
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:41,860
discouraged that we have to make sure

2332
01:43:38,739 --> 01:43:45,879
that on the presentations get pre-loaded

2333
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:47,709
before the session building on that bill

2334
01:43:45,879 --> 01:43:51,129
I remember a plenary talk that was given

2335
01:43:47,709 --> 01:43:55,709
remotely and one cannot imagine having

2336
01:43:51,129 --> 01:43:58,149
you know 800 people in the room in well

2337
01:43:55,709 --> 01:44:00,249
plus one to bill I totally rely on the

2338
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:01,719
network being up I'm often sending my

2339
01:44:00,249 --> 01:44:10,780
slides five minutes before the session

2340
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:12,459
starts good to speak on that but be

2341
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:13,898
eating our own dog food I think we need

2342
01:44:12,459 --> 01:44:15,099
to separate out the hackathon a little

2343
01:44:13,899 --> 01:44:17,860
bit that's a somewhat different event

2344
01:44:15,099 --> 01:44:19,689
that clearly is around the ability to do

2345
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:21,699
that and experimental and stuff but I

2346
01:44:19,689 --> 01:44:24,010
think that the things that get proposed

2347
01:44:21,699 --> 01:44:24,280
outside of the hackathon in the eat our

2348
01:44:24,010 --> 01:44:25,930
own

2349
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:27,550
are usually not actually about

2350
01:44:25,930 --> 01:44:29,170
discovering whether something works or

2351
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:31,870
not it's a marketing opportunity for

2352
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:33,640
technologists people believe in and I

2353
01:44:31,870 --> 01:44:35,080
don't I don't really think it adds very

2354
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:36,910
much value either as a marketing effort

2355
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:38,200
opportunity or as a discovery of how

2356
01:44:36,910 --> 01:44:40,240
well stuff works I think you should just

2357
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,099
you know figure out what network we need

2358
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:50,980
to get the job we came down here to do

2359
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:54,420
which is around skander's separate out

2360
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:54,419
the hackathon which is totally crazy

2361
01:44:55,650 --> 01:45:01,179
Cosmetics yeah I mean so you mentioned

2362
01:44:59,410 --> 01:45:02,620
that the printers are no longer in the

2363
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:04,360
terminal room I just wanted to say that

2364
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:07,210
wherever they are those are indeed

2365
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:10,210
extremely valuable I haven't needed them

2366
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:11,560
I mean there's been times you know I

2367
01:45:10,210 --> 01:45:16,780
don't always need them but when I need

2368
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:20,710
them I really need them so yeah it's all

2369
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:23,880
me I disagree on the on the topic of the

2370
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:26,680
photo room Wi-Fi I think it's needed and

2371
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,990
the reason is that I fall in the

2372
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:31,600
category of like I need to do meetings

2373
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:33,700
in between while I'm here and here the

2374
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,350
doubts at the space up there is great to

2375
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:39,220
have like a video call every now and

2376
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:41,560
then but if I'm in the hotel in the

2377
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:44,050
event hotel I prefer to go up to my room

2378
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:46,720
and have the meeting there and that

2379
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:48,610
comes back to whether the hotel Wi-Fi

2380
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:50,560
would be good enough for doing that and

2381
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:53,139
some hotels that might and other might

2382
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:56,170
not so I think if we basically we would

2383
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:58,480
drop the ITF Hotel Network on in the

2384
01:45:56,170 --> 01:46:03,010
rooms that would probably result in less

2385
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:04,660
people coming here actually I always

2386
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:07,060
coming up to echo pretty much that

2387
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:10,630
sentiment although I'm going to make one

2388
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:12,850
little consideration I'm sorry oh I'm

2389
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:14,110
sorry I'm not you know just think thank

2390
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:17,350
you

2391
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:19,750
when so I also find myself me and go to

2392
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:23,230
take a meeting that's not here because

2393
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:25,030
of other things now do I have to take

2394
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:28,179
that on my room sometimes I can find

2395
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:30,009
another place if there were a quiet it's

2396
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:31,630
smallish place available for that at the

2397
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:33,460
risk of expanding this in the meeting

2398
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:35,560
overall meeting venue stuff that could

2399
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:37,890
also come compensate for needing to take

2400
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,890
over the

2401
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:46,719
Bravo said two unrelated comments not as

2402
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:50,520
knock volunteer but on the subject of

2403
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:53,350
dog food and hackathon and terminal room

2404
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:56,110
back in the day we're developing our PKI

2405
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:59,560
there was a small cabal of RBI

2406
01:46:56,110 --> 01:47:02,710
developers and we had literally almost

2407
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:05,230
every idea like five years we would have

2408
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:07,360
an intro of event which is just three or

2409
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:09,339
four people sitting around the table in

2410
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,719
the terminal room seeing whether or not

2411
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:13,150
we'd actually match people with the same

2412
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:15,550
thing from the same specs that was

2413
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:17,200
incredibly valuable I don't care that

2414
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:19,660
it'd be called the turtle room they

2415
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:21,250
don't actually need network but there

2416
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:22,780
should be some place for doing that it

2417
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:24,460
should not just be the hackathon is

2418
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:30,880
actually sometimes we need to do it on

2419
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:34,300
Wednesday second thing and this is not

2420
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:36,490
volunteer I have a question group did we

2421
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:41,530
close let's go to the privacy protection

2422
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:43,540
question there um we actually have even

2423
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:44,500
within the NOC two lips what opinions

2424
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:46,210
about some of this I don't think it's

2425
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:48,550
really so much split there's just there

2426
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:51,070
are a lot of facets to it we primarily

2427
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:53,580
serve our operative guy my servers live

2428
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:56,440
out on the public Internet deal with it

2429
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:58,240
but it has been correctly pointed out a

2430
01:47:56,440 --> 01:48:00,219
number of times that most people I have

2431
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:02,349
talked to do not usually live out on the

2432
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:03,580
public Internet there's a question

2433
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:05,650
whether or not we're actually doing the

2434
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:06,790
community a service by exposing all

2435
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:09,160
their laptops to all this

2436
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:10,810
now the comments before about your

2437
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:13,630
exposed anyway deal with it you just

2438
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:16,300
maybe it's a smaller group ok stern

2439
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:17,770
lander threat I eight hundred of your

2440
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:20,230
closest friends as opposed to seven

2441
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:23,650
billion people okay so it's a scale

2442
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:25,540
problem but most people's laptops have

2443
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:28,150
not been exposed to this in most other

2444
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:29,590
environments and you know it's a

2445
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:31,330
legitimate question should we be doing

2446
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:32,950
something about that I have personally

2447
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:35,910
think it's one of your people you know

2448
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:35,910
that's the idea Thanks

2449
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:44,719
hi three things well to the last comment

2450
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:47,360
I actually think it's good to be exposed

2451
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:49,040
because in most laptops are in fact time

2452
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,630
to be exposed that people connect them

2453
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:53,000
to all different environments they have

2454
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:56,170
no idea what's there so they're exposed

2455
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:59,030
so I don't see we should be different

2456
01:48:56,170 --> 01:49:03,199
you know hard exterior soft interior

2457
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:05,449
doesn't offer support let's see the next

2458
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:07,219
one the terminal room thing I don't

2459
01:49:05,449 --> 01:49:11,839
think it's a network requirement I think

2460
01:49:07,219 --> 01:49:15,320
it's how the way we provide space in

2461
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:18,050
venues a venue that look here that has

2462
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:20,780
lots and lots of places little nooks and

2463
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:22,580
corners and tables and chairs all over

2464
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:25,280
the place probably don't need a separate

2465
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:27,170
terminal room quote-unquote camera room

2466
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:28,969
but there are other venues that don't

2467
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:32,540
have that where a room like that we can

2468
01:49:28,969 --> 01:49:35,090
sit down at a table and work good but so

2469
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:38,630
I don't think it just it's part of how

2470
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:40,340
we plan space at venues and the last one

2471
01:49:38,630 --> 01:49:42,980
yes I do think we should eat our own dog

2472
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:46,670
food I think that's part of the ITF

2473
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:49,370
culture and the ability to do that to do

2474
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:50,810
two experiments like we did the IQ piece

2475
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:53,660
it's only things you've learned a bunch

2476
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:55,370
of stuff there the others and futures

2477
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:58,670
and the ability to do that I think is

2478
01:49:55,370 --> 01:50:01,040
important it's you know it's like the

2479
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:05,420
hackathon so I think it's a really good

2480
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:06,830
activity to make the ICAT relevant okay

2481
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:09,140
we're going to close the mic lines at

2482
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:11,390
this point so that after these four

2483
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:14,210
people speak we will talk about next

2484
01:50:11,390 --> 01:50:15,949
steps um one of the things I was

2485
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:18,469
thinking about is as people were getting

2486
01:50:15,949 --> 01:50:21,889
up here Who am I huh I'm sorry Mike st.

2487
01:50:18,469 --> 01:50:23,510
John's was the question of how many

2488
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:25,370
people here are sort of key men and

2489
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:28,400
women with respect to their companies

2490
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:32,330
and how much does having a good network

2491
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:34,250
here allow them allow your company will

2492
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:38,059
let you come here and do the work as

2493
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:41,660
opposed to being there so and that's

2494
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:43,190
both the hotel rooms and here so I don't

2495
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:44,930
I'm not working for anybody directly

2496
01:50:43,190 --> 01:50:48,400
anymore so it doesn't matter for me but

2497
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:48,400
you might want to think about that

2498
01:50:49,139 --> 01:50:53,520
so sorry Warren Kumari so a number of

2499
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:55,320
people have mentioned stuff like know

2500
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,760
the ability to do meetings in their room

2501
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:59,280
something which I think we often forget

2502
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:01,350
is many of us also call our significant

2503
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:03,179
others from our room um

2504
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:05,159
sure one mentioned you know he sits in

2505
01:51:03,179 --> 01:51:07,980
his room does email you have a new kid

2506
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:10,320
I'm assuming that you also you know do

2507
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:15,540
video conferences with your kid on the

2508
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:17,400
cellular network okay I mean it hasn't

2509
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:24,179
worked for me and expensive but what's

2510
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:26,460
for you okay so Jason Livengood two

2511
01:51:24,179 --> 01:51:30,600
comments one on the dog food question

2512
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:32,820
and I may take the pet analogy here I do

2513
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:34,679
think that we are good at eating on dog

2514
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:36,809
food but it's almost like we're dogs

2515
01:51:34,679 --> 01:51:39,540
kept by the king in the palace and it's

2516
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:41,070
super special and it doesn't resemble

2517
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:43,560
the dog food that all the rest of the

2518
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:45,659
dogs outside the palace walls eat so it

2519
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:50,150
might be a question of like how premium

2520
01:51:45,659 --> 01:51:50,150
is dog are you taking this hunger games

2521
01:51:52,130 --> 01:51:58,830
and then the second is on the security

2522
01:51:56,150 --> 01:52:01,799
there's really interesting questions to

2523
01:51:58,830 --> 01:52:03,719
think a lot more about and this space is

2524
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,310
evolving pretty quickly and even user

2525
01:52:03,719 --> 01:52:08,250
expectations as we know here are

2526
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:10,110
changing quickly and I think it ties

2527
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:11,670
into the maybe the question about

2528
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:13,380
measurement data that maybe somebody

2529
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:16,230
else raised earlier you're really

2530
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:17,489
interested to see more data about the

2531
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:20,780
things that are happening in the network

2532
01:52:17,489 --> 01:52:22,650
you know or is there a lot of c2 traffic

2533
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:23,820
you know are there a lot of attacks

2534
01:52:22,650 --> 01:52:25,170
maybe gave it all these kinds of things

2535
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:27,059
would be really interesting you know

2536
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:29,219
more about to make a more informed

2537
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:30,989
assessment but I think it's probably a

2538
01:52:29,219 --> 01:52:36,210
really interesting to probe much much

2539
01:52:30,989 --> 01:52:41,040
more it can't be real quick very much uh

2540
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:42,690
to Rob's question of you know to what

2541
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:46,110
extent do I expect my laptop to work

2542
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:48,089
come on up you know fully open internet

2543
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:50,429
connection I've taken advantage of that

2544
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:51,750
here if we're gonna do some dog fooding

2545
01:52:50,429 --> 01:52:53,460
stuff but we're gonna do some of this

2546
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:54,480
there may be some other things that we

2547
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:57,150
want to actually look at offering

2548
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:59,098
somebody earlier I think mentioned v6 PD

2549
01:52:57,150 --> 01:53:01,500
you know so if I want to go and actually

2550
01:52:59,099 --> 01:53:02,420
run something to an experiment it may

2551
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,489
also make sense

2552
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:06,170
to just dedicate that off on a separate

2553
01:53:04,489 --> 01:53:07,489
SSID which I know gets into the

2554
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:09,590
engineering thing that you guys not to

2555
01:53:07,489 --> 01:53:11,809
do but I think there's I think there's

2556
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:14,360
other areas to explore for this but I

2557
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:16,370
think in general you know when we talked

2558
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:18,019
about the security of openness a lot of

2559
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:19,580
us are plugging these devices connecting

2560
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:20,170
them to unknown wireless networks all

2561
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:23,059
the time

2562
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:25,699
and that is just kind of the natural

2563
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:28,010
state of things and I have a corporate

2564
01:53:25,699 --> 01:53:31,160
managed device it has protections in

2565
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:32,750
place to to you know do stuff whether or

2566
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:36,019
not they're the right ones you can argue

2567
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:38,060
about in the hallway but that's the case

2568
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:41,540
but as far as working remotely warned

2569
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:45,920
the line was cut picking I'm sorry

2570
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:48,949
and you know the you know as far as

2571
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:50,540
being able to work remotely and such you

2572
01:53:48,949 --> 01:53:53,540
know the network here is excellent and I

2573
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:55,370
and I've had no issues remoting in and

2574
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:57,469
like I said I've seen people video

2575
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:59,630
conferencing out here as well including

2576
01:53:57,469 --> 01:54:00,860
co-workers so as far as being a critical

2577
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:06,140
employee being able to get stuff done

2578
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:08,120
I'm able to do that so just a really

2579
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:09,469
quick short response Jared I should

2580
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:12,739
point out that you and month might

2581
01:54:09,469 --> 01:54:14,630
laptops are well-managed the ITF - hotel

2582
01:54:12,739 --> 01:54:22,820
has a whole bunch of people who are ITF

2583
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:28,280
participants and so forth okay um we let

2584
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:32,389
the riffraff in - is what they say so I

2585
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:34,670
will say that um I I had originally

2586
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:36,590
thought that we would rip right through

2587
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:40,400
these questions and be done in an hour

2588
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:43,730
and I should have realized that that was

2589
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:46,910
not going to be the case um but there

2590
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:50,559
were not food fun there were no food

2591
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:53,059
fights so but I don't think we have

2592
01:54:50,560 --> 01:55:01,969
answered the question sufficiently to

2593
01:54:53,060 --> 01:55:03,560
help well so we're on the what next

2594
01:55:01,969 --> 01:55:05,530
question and I think that at this point

2595
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:07,850
I feel like we haven't really quite

2596
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:10,190
answered we haven't provided enough

2597
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:11,989
feedback to the NOC to help guide some

2598
01:55:10,190 --> 01:55:14,389
of our design sessions going forward I

2599
01:55:11,989 --> 01:55:15,950
think we've also not provided enough

2600
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:19,180
information that's going to help

2601
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:26,389
ministration side of the house so we

2602
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:28,550
have a mailing list and so I my we have

2603
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:30,920
like about five minutes to discuss next

2604
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:33,050
steps I would like to think about the

2605
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:34,640
concept of using the mailing list to

2606
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:36,560
develop a survey that we could then send

2607
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:38,470
out to the community using the mailing

2608
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,940
lists to further discuss requirements

2609
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:43,120
and then any other suggestions in the

2610
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:45,799
next five minutes

2611
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:48,349
Jerry Lee is this the meeting venue a

2612
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:50,480
list or it because this is all under one

2613
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:52,160
venue or is this a different list no no

2614
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:56,389
that there's a network requirements list

2615
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:59,059
okay any t it's a young these two

2616
01:55:56,390 --> 01:56:00,200
activities are going to be much no we're

2617
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:03,940
gonna keep the network requirements

2618
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:05,540
separate from the venue requirements I

2619
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:07,099
expect there'll be some communication

2620
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:09,290
between the two of them but there's

2621
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:18,260
currently a net requirements mailing

2622
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:20,750
list that was set up for this off so in

2623
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:23,570
terms of next steps I've heard pretty

2624
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:29,810
clearly that people still have a lot of

2625
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:35,450
value I heard that there are a lot of

2626
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:38,330
questions about the IT outside but I

2627
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:42,220
also heard some responses to the

2628
01:56:38,330 --> 01:56:42,220
questions around privacy and security

2629
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:48,620
what protections get provided for Dome

2630
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:53,300
and those things that might need to get

2631
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:56,540
answered before either question so

2632
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:59,450
there's probably staging there and I

2633
01:56:56,540 --> 01:57:01,040
want to remind people that when we run

2634
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:04,929
the network

2635
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:04,930
[Music]

2636
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:14,450
let me up again I'd like to have one

2637
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:18,210
very quick humming vote from you because

2638
01:57:14,450 --> 01:57:20,160
your all you sum up some of you have

2639
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:23,640
done this for many many years and some

2640
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:30,830
of you are new to this do you consider a

2641
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:33,060
netted ipv4 network still heresy so I

2642
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:35,280
just like to get the feeling in the room

2643
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:38,910
this when I work whenever I brought this

2644
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:41,370
up I was shut down with like so III

2645
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:41,580
think that we should we should not do

2646
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:45,840
that

2647
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:46,559
I think we've is asking the question

2648
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,600
Harrison

2649
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,370
asking the question is not heresy but

2650
01:57:48,600 --> 01:58:00,450
I'm as a chair I'm not gonna let you do

2651
01:57:50,370 --> 01:58:01,920
a home what come on that question it's

2652
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:03,360
like all right it seems like we may have

2653
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,060
gotten to a point in time where we can

2654
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:08,519
use v6 so much that maybe we should just

2655
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:10,590
let them be for be like you know really

2656
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:13,740
a ghetto who cares if it's Natta

2657
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:16,080
that's on the sidelines right in

2658
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:17,700
case you haven't quite gotten there yet

2659
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:20,220
or in case you haven't picked up on it

2660
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:29,639
that has been a source of not team

2661
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:32,010
internal conflict so with that any other

2662
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:33,390
comments on way forward so I think we

2663
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:39,450
will move this conversation to the

2664
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:43,680
mailing list and see if we can get some

2665
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:45,990
solidity clarity

2666
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:49,380
Hans Kuhn I have a comment about next

2667
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:51,360
steps is there any idea about how to

2668
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:54,420
communicate to the community as this

2669
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:58,500
process moves forward will update to be

2670
01:58:54,420 --> 01:59:00,710
posted to ETF all or only to the network

2671
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:03,330
requirements mailing lists or what's the

2672
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:06,600
best way to communicate with this

2673
01:59:03,330 --> 01:59:09,809
audience as more information to this

2674
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:13,920
discussion about budgetary issues and

2675
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:16,350
you know meeting requirements etc so I

2676
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:19,410
think one thing we need to do is on that

2677
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:21,120
mailing list collaborate to

2678
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:23,340
figure out what questions we want to

2679
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:25,590
send as a survey or include in the next

2680
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:31,500
meeting survey so that we can get more

2681
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:33,540
clarity surveys are hard but so getting

2682
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:35,310
big different perspectives and looks

2683
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:39,980
into the way those questions should be

2684
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:39,980
asked yes I think one important textile

2685
01:59:40,850 --> 01:59:45,720
all right

2686
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:47,460
I think there's cookies all right just

2687
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:48,900
to follow up on the survey I think that

2688
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:50,850
the real bottom line here is the next

2689
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:52,589
step is to collect data and the way to

2690
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:54,360
do that is through surveys and then also

2691
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:55,890
some data can be collected from the NOC

2692
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:59,809
thank you all very much for your

2693
01:59:55,890 --> 01:59:59,810
patience today enjoy the cookies Oh

2694
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:07,980
cookies our next break oh I'm sorry

2695
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:10,370
oh no cookies you weren't good enough so

2696
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:10,370
