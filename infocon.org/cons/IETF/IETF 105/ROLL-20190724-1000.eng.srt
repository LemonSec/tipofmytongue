here we want to start our meeting so

18
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,729
please a word that the meeting is called

19
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,240
under not well read it carefully we

20
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:51,539
don't want to read it here okay this is

21
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,110
the MIDI material thank you again to

22
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:58,840
Dominique and Michael for healthy nuts

23
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,590
please sign the blue sheets okay this is

24
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,590
our agenda

25
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,679
do we have comments we are going to have

26
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,960
Rao remotely but he is not going to be

27
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,110
able to use video so we are going to

28
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:25,630
have it only in audio mode but he is

29
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:42,340
going to be online okay okay great thank

30
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:45,789
you okay this is all my mind stunts do

31
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,638
we have crane all the columns here we

32
00:07:45,789 --> 00:08:04,840
have some delays but they want to work

33
00:07:48,639 --> 00:08:06,849
on that hopefully some aah miss the use

34
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,859
of our PL info actually being in the

35
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:11,500
last stage you just have to put the

36
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,259
points and the commas in and all that so

37
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,820
very good congratulations but we were

38
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,110
really applauded when the numbers are

39
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,110
distributed okay

40
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,339
[Laughter]

41
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,340
[Music]

42
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:11,310
they have commented milestones so we

43
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,260
have several documents that are from

44
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,550
balloons the working group but they are

45
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:20,610
expired so it would be nice they can

46
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:29,339
rest I mean put alive again some way

47
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:32,040
like yeah yes especially for the young

48
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,890
model I'm still looking forward to some

49
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,630
people who may comment on that and once

50
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,790
that is done we can put it forward

51
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:42,600
because not really uncompressed document

52
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,490
and reading it is not too complex to

53
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,500
take you in quarter of an hour you point

54
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:52,810
out to most mistakes and that will be it

55
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:56,170
the young model of nipple MPL

56
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,170
[Music]

57
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:03,100
the question was how we have some drafts

58
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:06,100
which expired and are not coming forward

59
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,110
and what is going to happen and I picked

60
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,019
out one draft of which I happened to be

61
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,329
an author and I told them that if there

62
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,369
are any reaction on them and that can be

63
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:22,988
very difficult I think then this one

64
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:25,600
they may go forward as well okay this is

65
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:27,819
the status of our active internet draft

66
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,350
we are going to have some and discuss

67
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:33,219
discussing today other ones are on hold

68
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,079
there are some that I want to be

69
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:41,110
continued like it is modification

70
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:42,099
hopefully oh that's great thank you

71
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,589
thank you thank you

72
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:49,959
and yeah good then we have related

73
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:54,910
internet draft that too often they're

74
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:57,279
going to be discussed today that we need

75
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,999
as well reviews for rural traffic a word

76
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:08,049
if some volunteer for review pleased to

77
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:11,019
it okay this is our open tickets there

78
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:13,839
are one couple really with the doubt

79
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:17,549
projection so I think if during the

80
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,259
presentation of the projection if we

81
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:23,290
after the presentation if we arise those

82
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:33,569
documents those tickets I think is ready

83
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:33,569
for the last fall and Pascal thank you

84
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:42,730
so the del projection is actually still

85
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:44,559
alive and kicking and progressing and I

86
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,889
hope that we're close to last call but

87
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,929
but now might be things that we want to

88
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:54,730
add to the document before we actually

89
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:59,199
close it so the the recent changes are

90
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,480
related to our the encoding the RFC

91
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:03,729
eight ones create encoding and things

92
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,660
like that to to elf implementation so we

93
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,250
give examples and there was discovered

94
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,880
that we got that

95
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,160
when we want to ever to tell the route

96
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,230
that there is an error on projected

97
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,430
route then instead of use from the

98
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,230
packet as it stood to differentiate a

99
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,599
source route packet which no more

100
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,470
resources run packet from a project it's

101
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,700
or a packet so because there is no state

102
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,170
from the projected route in the

103
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,930
intermediate note in the source route

104
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,150
model remember we started with norms

105
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,550
with storing mode and we added non story

106
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,140
mode projected routes in a non storing

107
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,880
mode projected route you have a source

108
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,280
routing it now you follow it but you

109
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,439
have no state in ultimate not note so

110
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,240
when you see the packet Oh should I

111
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,070
report to the soul should I report to

112
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,840
the route or is there any other case

113
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,340
right now it would be the route the

114
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,050
route anyway I can ask that in the

115
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:01,030
future support of so swatting it could

116
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:04,000
be anything so we decided about the

117
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,160
mailing list that having a flag to say a

118
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,070
it's this type of route so the euro

119
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,589
message should be this was was

120
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,110
interesting and so what we did with the

121
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:17,230
last version is add a flag in the API

122
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:22,030
the hop-by-hop option and what that was

123
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:23,830
fine but that means changing dating RFC

124
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,589
eight one three eight to indicate this

125
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:30,910
flag right and actually as we went

126
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:33,310
through that we realized that most of

127
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:38,199
what you find today in the API is not

128
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:39,880
useful in a projected rod because for

129
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,790
instance the flags that are used for

130
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,570
loop avoidance go away because there's

131
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,260
no concept of up and down so we went

132
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:53,290
through the exercise of actually

133
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:56,620
defining a new format for our state one

134
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,780
three eight for compressing the API when

135
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,380
it's being used in the context of

136
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,360
projected route so it's actually smaller

137
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,260
right and it can contain this flag that

138
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,300
that we're about so that's the the the

139
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,630
biggest change we made so here is the

140
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,060
flag in the non compressed format

141
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,820
basically extending our see six five

142
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,989
five three

143
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:25,590
they see my call to my question right

144
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,610
now my college just my good um so that's

145
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,600
really interesting that what you just

146
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:32,940
said that so you extended it we have the

147
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,370
uncompressed format but then in the

148
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,200
process of trying to compress it you

149
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,970
discovered additional efficiencies is

150
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,680
what I understood using the compression

151
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,040
format yes again and does that apply to

152
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,109
just projected roots yes or all uses

153
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,640
just project you just projected so

154
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,500
basically you have a different

155
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,430
compression format for the projected

156
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:59,420
route or this thing that sounds cool

157
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:59,420
okay and actually if you look deeper

158
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:08,070
this K in this case the API is actually

159
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,300
elective because if you ignore it that

160
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:14,210
doesn't change the way you route the

161
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:16,560
packet it's just just if you if you

162
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:21,270
you're interested in it if you throw an

163
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,829
error basically so it the forwarding

164
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,590
would work without understanding that

165
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,470
that field meaning that normal API is

166
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:30,540
not elect if you have to understand it

167
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,040
but this one is elective and that's a

168
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,500
cool thing because if you have an old

169
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,920
implementation which can forward the

170
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,350
longer sauce right path right and does

171
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,939
everything as it did before when the

172
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,940
error will still go to the root it's

173
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,470
good it's it's going to be the wrong

174
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,000
gear of code but you still will go to

175
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,740
the root and you see will get an error

176
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,050
meaning that it's okay if it ignores and

177
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:59,520
the way we built the elective and and

178
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:01,380
monetary compression formats makes it so

179
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,800
that an old implementation will actually

180
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,250
let any API through which will just

181
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
ignore it

182
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,470
so we are backward compatible that's

183
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,209
kind of cool if we had to change a

184
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:17,010
mandatory format then we would have a

185
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:19,440
flag day prom again but so we basically

186
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,569
introduced a new idolatry for an

187
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,260
elective API this time that's why we

188
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,260
call it the API

189
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:33,630
then we provide a well first the format

190
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,889
is like this we pick the same type if

191
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,630
you looked at the way we did at one

192
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:38,610
three eight we actually avoided

193
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,350
overlapping the types in elective and

194
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,420
mandatory meaning that the number five

195
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:47,759
which is the RPI in modern critical can

196
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,969
be used also in elective or also a RPI

197
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,670
right so not type five in elective and

198
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,670
critical will we'll both be RPI which is

199
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,050
kind of cool so it's pretty much why we

200
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,639
did not match at the time because we

201
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:05,668
thought that maybe this would happen it

202
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:08,159
actually does now the formats of doing

203
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,600
of the packets being sauce rot from a

204
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,860
source which is not the route to a

205
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,069
destination which is not the route

206
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:17,668
either was never used before because for

207
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,230
now till now the source routing was

208
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,480
always coming from the route so there is

209
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,980
an optimization in the IP to IP when the

210
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,470
route is the source of the destination

211
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,120
in this case it's neither but eight one

212
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,940
three eight was sought for it even if we

213
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,678
never used it before so I give an

214
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,690
example of that format and actually we

215
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,400
also reach for fit in an example similar

216
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:43,950
to that in use of ripple info a key

217
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:48,360
question question question hello can you

218
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:50,039
hear me yep right so the particle you

219
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,870
just mentioned couple of slides before

220
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:58,379
that the packet won't go up and down but

221
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,719
that is true only for the source routed

222
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,720
the projected down or outside I mean

223
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,750
it's not true for storing mode projected

224
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,919
down well are you saying that the

225
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:14,700
compression just is it is because you

226
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:17,159
the path that the storing mode injects

227
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,980
doesn't have to be a longer tier that it

228
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,950
can be any path right I mean usually we

229
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,350
give example where the storing path is a

230
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,140
compression of a non storing path just

231
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,299
to reduce the number of countries in the

232
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,480
rotting either doesn't have to be so if

233
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:35,100
the route is capable of injecting a non

234
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,020
storing path in the network it's also

235
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,639
capable of injecting a story path in the

236
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,690
network it doesn't have to be a longer

237
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,629
tier bag and

238
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,429
anything so once you're in a project

239
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:48,120
garage you can never go out of it

240
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:52,080
because you may create a loop so the

241
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,758
bottom line is that there is no up and

242
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,990
down there is just this path you follow

243
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,940
it or you die but you just mentioned

244
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,879
that there is a possibility of creating

245
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:06,360
a loop with storing mode of operation

246
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:08,100
for well even though there is there is a

247
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,559
possibility we have text on that and

248
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:15,449
maybe it can be improved but the bits as

249
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,730
existed don't help okay right so we have

250
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,860
ample text but but the bits rely on the

251
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,720
fact that you understand the geotag and

252
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,549
you understand that the packet that went

253
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,169
down can never go up again but here you

254
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:29,549
don't have that concept because the rods

255
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,230
can be in any direction there is no

256
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,700
concept of up and down you're swimming

257
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,110
in the sea don't know where the bottom

258
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:40,350
and the top are so you can't use the

259
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,740
bits down we are trying to avoid loops

260
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:48,269
with all sorts of things but basically

261
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,789
the flags don't help so here is the

262
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:55,409
format actually that we end up with if

263
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:57,090
you have a 23-8 in place between a

264
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:00,570
source and destination so what's

265
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,610
interesting you know 8 1 3/8 is supposed

266
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,370
to be equivalent to ipv6 it's just

267
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,250
another encoding of the same thing now

268
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,258
the weights encoded is usually that you

269
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,240
place all the destination information in

270
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,519
the front so if you have one destination

271
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,929
is the first thing that you have if you

272
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,480
are watching a Dominic that you have a

273
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:21,179
series of destinations their whole place

274
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,919
in the front one after the other which

275
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,450
is very different from normal way of

276
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,460
ipv6 where you have the first

277
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,200
destination in the IP header and then

278
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,000
the saucer out there somewhere else and

279
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,610
you have to do swapping games etc all

280
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,200
this is gone when you use the eight one

281
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,719
three eight format so you start with the

282
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,480
routing at the destinations usually you

283
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,799
have either the destinations which means

284
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,960
you come from the route and you go down

285
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,940
or or you have the junk apps alator

286
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,409
which then you go up and the

287
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,000
encapsulation is not the route but if

288
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:50,399
junk of territory is a route it's elided

289
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,289
when these guys you have both the

290
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,639
destination of the IP and IP and the

291
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,429
source because neither

292
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,980
neither is delighted right so it's it's

293
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,950
it's completely compatible with a 23-8

294
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,650
issues that maybe people never coded for

295
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:08,040
that because if you did the minimum code

296
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,620
for exactly what you need it for

297
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:14,220
classical repo where the sauce rotator

298
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,719
is always coming from the root then you

299
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,280
never had an encapsulated or that they

300
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,200
have in blue here in your packets now

301
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,220
you do because the source is not the

302
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,290
root so we still have a number of

303
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,330
discussions that's where I'm I'm

304
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,280
wondering what's the well now is the

305
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,570
time for Walker plastic or not I really

306
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,549
want to close this document that we

307
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,360
wanted to finish it we want to implement

308
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:39,418
it but but there's one big question is

309
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,360
we never really soft is how does the

310
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,130
root know about the topology what do we

311
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,379
do we said oh it's not this back right

312
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,410
but we don't have nobody started the

313
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,090
other spec which says how that happens

314
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,580
so right now we know how to project a

315
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:57,149
lot we don't know how to compute it and

316
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,830
I I mean either we start a draft and

317
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,220
then we're in for two three years or we

318
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,889
just add an option in that one so that

319
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,049
the root knows so maybe this one could

320
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,690
be the vessel for if we can find a

321
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:11,160
minimal way to provide topology

322
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,870
information to the root maybe we could

323
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,700
package that option into this document

324
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,699
that's the question I'm asking to the

325
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,590
group here agree with that you're greedy

326
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,530
it was basically what we have today

327
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,540
right in we have story mode sorry non

328
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,700
storing mode a non storing mode the root

329
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,129
has most of the information already it

330
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,750
has all the do that right but if you

331
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,360
want to do a route east-west

332
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,280
well maybe it's gonna be not to optimize

333
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,168
because you only see the do dark so we

334
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,389
only see links in the do dark the parent

335
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:42,720
to child what you would like to see is a

336
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,010
bit more sibling rot sibling so so what

337
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,929
you really need is something like the

338
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,580
target option well you have the target

339
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:49,440
option that's me and then you have the

340
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,299
transit option which is my parents and I

341
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,650
have a list of transit option so so I

342
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,540
tell the routes here is here are my

343
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,120
parents but I would like to tell the

344
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,610
route is here are my siblings right so

345
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,850
we could define a sibling option in like

346
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:07,040
30 lines of text in this pack or we try

347
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,040
all new RC which will take two years

348
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:13,639
if you're inclined of doing that if the

349
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:15,770
group says I do it let's just propose an

350
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,960
option put it in that stack proposed the

351
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:25,639
option yes good good I'm paying that

352
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:30,980
confirm their comments about that and

353
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:33,140
you show you this okay so soon we can

354
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,230
just put the option and go to the

355
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,610
working group that's a way right I will

356
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,560
propose a format on the mailing list

357
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,120
they will ask feedback for what goes in

358
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:45,860
it what doesn't go in it blah blah blah

359
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,199
and then who you are as well they pair

360
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,750
up with the other options like like I do

361
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,940
it like I separate like I note this

362
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:57,920
could be as well done in another RFC or

363
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:03,110
well in the mail limit or in the spike

364
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:05,390
in to spy kids you you okay I first

365
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,040
confirm with the mail I propose the

366
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,930
option in the mail and then if I don't

367
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,350
if I get positive feedback and negative

368
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,350
feedback blah blah blah publish anyway

369
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:23,060
second thing is we still need more

370
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,950
capabilities so the node can express

371
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,830
that you can do either of those things

372
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,780
so the for instance how much memory do I

373
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,780
have how many storing not storing rods

374
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,030
can I store in my node right so the root

375
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,560
does not overload I note with too many

376
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:42,560
routes we don't have right now any way

377
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:46,550
of doing it the logical way is to

378
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,080
provide a map using Howells draft the

379
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:51,649
only problem with that is that round

380
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,939
draft is not yet an RFC and so we will

381
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:58,120
have a dependency on it so what I want

382
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,460
to do is use Ronald's raft refer to it

383
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,169
and so I will ask you to progress files

384
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,640
draft as soon as you can right that's

385
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,560
pretty much what goes with that because

386
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,130
we wit will have to hold this one this

387
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,899
one or if you have a better way you can

388
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,850
also put some options in there which

389
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,160
would be very specific to this and not

390
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,560
choose Ross draft that's y'all tonight I

391
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,540
think if they mobile x-ray mobile draft

392
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,020
define the capabilities we should all

393
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,770
use

394
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,720
right so right I mean the demamp

395
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,970
extension is not a big draft it's just a

396
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,790
format that can be extensible I mean why

397
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,710
don't we progress it yes I want to talk

398
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,030
about that today so yeah so I hope all

399
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:39,290
that you tell us that you're ready to

400
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:42,020
publish yes

401
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,210
then the draft goes through something

402
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,450
very complex which is what happens if

403
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,340
you want to suppose to have a full path

404
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,940
that is completely established in one

405
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,270
shot

406
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:56,150
how do you stitch path well that's still

407
00:25:53,270 --> 00:26:00,440
okay but how do you find sense of a

408
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:03,530
loose or out with storing in between

409
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,050
right because tall told you if you start

410
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,540
using projected rod you cannot go away

411
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,700
and use the normal dag because it could

412
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,700
take you back earlier in the projected

413
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,040
rod you may you may create clips right

414
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,080
that's where our loops come from so if

415
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,659
you start entering this topology this

416
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,870
virtual topology that is the projected

417
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:27,620
rod you must follow it to the end that's

418
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:29,928
how you avoid loops now the route can

419
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,510
say hey I can do an on storing path from

420
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:35,059
A to B and then down from B to C or B to

421
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:38,000
D I can have two other projected rods

422
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:39,320
and you concatenate them as long as

423
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,929
you're doing that you probably look lies

424
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,120
but if you start doing things like oh

425
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm stitching storing and non storing

426
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,570
rot etc then if some nodes in the middle

427
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:55,610
lose some state you know that

428
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:58,428
so how how far do we want to go with us

429
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,320
do we want to say I place some rules

430
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:02,240
already to limit the way you could play

431
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,220
with those stacks I would like people to

432
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,020
review that I mean I think that's the

433
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,150
most critical piece in this draft is

434
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,550
loop avoidance all right with which

435
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:13,550
protection which limitation how do we

436
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,490
make things simple that we know that

437
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,780
won't the raw loops but then same time

438
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,840
will limit the capabilities of the

439
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,790
protocol right so that needs to be well

440
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,899
thought people need to look at that if

441
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,610
there is only one thing you need to look

442
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,650
at is this right okay we are going to

443
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,208
create a ticket for that so he's well

444
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,799
documented as well

445
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:33,509
and then there is all the compression

446
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,329
games do we want to do the compression

447
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:39,809
in that it's true for for the VA option

448
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:41,908
it's true for anything in ripple right

449
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:45,029
now we have compressed the data plane we

450
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:47,159
have not compressed the the control

451
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:51,689
plane and George's wants to speak about

452
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:54,139
that about the last point are actually

453
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:56,099
urges at George fermium to Atlantic

454
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,869
about the ripple control plane

455
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:01,019
impression we're meeting our draft as

456
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:02,369
well we need we need anyway a draft and

457
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,109
rip okuu pressure I don't understand

458
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:05,819
that we don't have it I thought that we

459
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:11,489
would do it in the coming years right

460
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:12,928
after repo in Tim okay now now we have

461
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:15,589
eight one three eight so we're in a very

462
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:18,569
different situation than we were in 2007

463
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:20,759
2010 we have eight one three eight so we

464
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:24,299
already have the format for the

465
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:27,899
compressing the the rods so why don't we

466
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:30,239
just Express the via option already in

467
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:32,908
the eight one three eight format meaning

468
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:34,139
that when you build a package natively

469
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:35,759
in eight one three eight you just have

470
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:38,129
to take this and put it in your packet

471
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,739
so it would make the implementation much

472
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:42,718
easier if the format that we have here

473
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:44,659
is the native formatting format in which

474
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:48,149
they will actually write the packet

475
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:53,369
makes our control smaller and makes the

476
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:55,379
implementation easier so I mean right

477
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:56,849
now I just wanted to say here is what's

478
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:59,248
in there it's a more logical

479
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:02,938
representation but I think when we go to

480
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:05,519
bits and bytes I mean it's very easy for

481
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:07,949
me to express this same spec with a much

482
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,759
smaller every option just because it's

483
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:16,769
an already compressing that one's rate

484
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:18,269
opinions but that means people use that

485
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:24,029
one three eight most it would be stupid

486
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:29,159
not to this is Peter

487
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:30,689
fantastic I really want to draft I mean

488
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,179
you have been talking about this you

489
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:35,039
have changed it we changed it I mean and

490
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:38,009
now we seem to converge which is very

491
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,829
nice but I really want to get it fixed

492
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:43,890
so if you're if there are additions

493
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:46,260
which can be actually exported to other

494
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,170
documents and if it can be simplified

495
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,340
and such such that additions can be done

496
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,770
in other documents

497
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,480
I would certainly prefer so that this

498
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,460
document is the standard way where you

499
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,100
could this is the base document in which

500
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,450
you can show that we have these

501
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,820
alternative routes and if there any

502
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,740
additions or optimizations then this

503
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,740
document is the reference and you can go

504
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,770
forward so them you can write up with

505
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,230
this document without - because if you

506
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,629
look at this list we are not going to

507
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:22,110
have very group last call before before

508
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:29,280
November noise we will make a pause oh I

509
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:30,540
can disagree done okay I think there is

510
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,910
a minimum said that we need to ship

511
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,200
otherwise it makes no sense we needed RS

512
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,060
anyway and then we delayed the

513
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,030
implementation a lot more than we would

514
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,590
right so there is a balance here it's

515
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:45,540
there's nothing obvious I'm saying but

516
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:51,209
what I understood is that that Michael

517
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:55,440
Richardson here that that the wrote the

518
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,880
Dow protection mechanism is probably not

519
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,710
functional without some of these

520
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,140
additions is that what I really yes

521
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,970
exactly is that we really can't have you

522
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,690
can't have an implementation without

523
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:09,140
these other bits all right and so I I'm

524
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:13,080
sympathetic to to what Peter suggested

525
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,460
in general but I think that it needs to

526
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,250
be in one place for an implementer to

527
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,290
say do all of this but there's not so

528
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,770
much Peter it's not like it's open book

529
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:25,680
right I try to really list what's

530
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,120
important IIIi actually don't think it

531
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,170
matters whether you have have one

532
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,360
document or four and it's the complex in

533
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:36,630
fact it's probably worth it for the ESG

534
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,550
review if you have four because the hot

535
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:41,400
reviewed as a group anyway to understand

536
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:44,159
it and and they don't unless they all

537
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,900
just pass and they don't want too many

538
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,490
RFC's coming out of the group right

539
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:53,370
they're saying a what load are you

540
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:55,100
pushing on us yeah so so that yeah we're

541
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,949
not pushing a lot

542
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,980
oh we are actually actually I do think

543
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,929
that you know we do have quite an

544
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,770
interesting number of specs out of this

545
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:08,360
group actually it's a predictive what

546
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,350
the problem we have with our documents

547
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,059
is they're interesting and the iesg

548
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,850
is attracted to interesting shiny

549
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:19,240
objects good so he make our documents

550
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:22,668
more boring then they will just go Chuck

551
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,490
okay so guess what Peter I'll try to put

552
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:27,950
some more energy on this one to get

553
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,159
those things soft on this one I did not

554
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,990
mention I mentioned stitching right but

555
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:38,179
think about it for just a second we are

556
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:41,120
not if we just push okay if we just push

557
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:45,429
Cyril path ABCD in the network and

558
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,020
that's it it will never work because

559
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:49,970
it's very the route can be very far away

560
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,980
from the route and the route cannot

561
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:55,190
react instantly to any problem along

562
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,440
that path so when will be effectively

563
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:01,280
using this bag to layout routes it's

564
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,429
going to be do Dax it won't be ABCD it's

565
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,059
going to be a B or C then maybe B to C

566
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:09,440
then C to D EC to whatever it's going to

567
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,020
be idea that it's going to be a complex

568
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:17,030
thing that's why we need to stitch stuff

569
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:20,030
right I'm I have two very validate that

570
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:22,480
the way we express things today allows

571
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,240
us to stitch things in the right fashion

572
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,159
because it's not variable otherwise

573
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,080
linear of path is okay in the TV world

574
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,289
where you have wires and very reliable

575
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,199
links but it's not viable in a wireless

576
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:38,690
mesh which is quite large we build

577
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,010
meshes of two thousand three thousand

578
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:45,620
nodes and sometimes 10 to 20 hops and we

579
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:48,260
deploy them and they work but if you

580
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:51,439
have to push a storing mode or non

581
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,530
storing mode project Arad then 20 hops

582
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,929
away and then there is a glitch on one

583
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,760
of those links you can't go to other

584
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:01,400
route please solve this problem for me

585
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,919
you have to separate the forwarding from

586
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,340
the rotting what belongs to the routing

587
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,080
is those gray lines that it monitors

588
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,639
statistically

589
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,230
now to understand this gray line is a

590
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,690
bit more great and this one's with more

591
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,550
blacks ones will go white let me be able

592
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,340
to use some redundancy so you have

593
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,990
enough we doesn't see at all times to

594
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,040
get packet from A to B and the rest is

595
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,839
not my problem

596
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,690
that's what the writing will do that's

597
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:29,330
what the Dow projection will do what the

598
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,060
forwarding will do is use the lip of

599
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:35,569
things like that to understand what the

600
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,489
actual state are of those links is to

601
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,840
use this neo dag between a and B it's

602
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,449
usually two three halves right it's not

603
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,970
four but but it's multiple possibilities

604
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:46,069
and in run time I have to look at my

605
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,750
packet and say hey what kind of

606
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,490
redundancy do I want to use in this

607
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,199
packet and to do that I need to very

608
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,928
well understand the state of all those

609
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,310
hops which means they have something in

610
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,890
the following plane which is just

611
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,660
happening in that little deal dag that

612
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,509
the rot projection was built for me and

613
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:05,450
that lets me use it optimally so I get

614
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:08,240
my packets wrong if I flood the Geo tag

615
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,779
I'm wasting energy so I need to use it

616
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,399
wisely

617
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,810
and that's when all the information I

618
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,150
can get actually is good that you're in

619
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,310
the runs that but it's actually this

620
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,230
kind of information package know am

621
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,330
feedback to source to source routing

622
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:24,290
about the Geo tag that's what worth will

623
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:29,150
save the day right so so we basically

624
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:30,410
need the source in storing in on storing

625
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,880
we need to source to be able to know

626
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,920
exactly what are the possibilities in

627
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,770
this do that so it's it's about getting

628
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,970
through information and stitching it so

629
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,450
so you need to be able to correlate

630
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:43,970
multiple segments and make that a Geo

631
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,919
tag right now the draft just gives you

632
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,399
segments not the full deck so we need to

633
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,460
make sure that we can express that I

634
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,250
hope I was clear maybe not okay and

635
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:58,760
that's that's it for me so yes we have

636
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:02,900
suggestions here so roll roll is the

637
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:07,190
place to do the slow piece right how do

638
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,230
you do this great do tag and I'm trying

639
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,540
to create a new working group called row

640
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,040
for reliable viable Wireless which is

641
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,340
the other piece of that story I have

642
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,930
this local to your deck how do I use it

643
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,710
it's not a writing prime anymore it's a

644
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,940
falling prom it's about OAM it's about

645
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:26,359
link information

646
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,550
instant reaction to two events so that's

647
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,460
what Roe is about ranch was in Roe then

648
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,660
we have a meeting on Thursday morning

649
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,060
what's gone that's pretty much it I'm

650
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,690
sorry that's that's that's a side

651
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:41,450
meaning that's a sign meeting raw well

652
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:44,030
reliable and available wireless it's how

653
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:48,618
you all okay

654
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:51,470
it used to be power yes but the HD told

655
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:54,950
us that power looks like powers which

656
00:36:51,470 --> 00:37:02,480
was white space yes and so this is white

657
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:06,680
but not space so that that's it for this

658
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:10,700
one do any question slid out from Cisco

659
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,490
and we know that a projector dogs very

660
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:16,460
useful for the p2p case but we have a

661
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,479
case that is not too far from the mic

662
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,359
okay

663
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,680
Lita from Cisco my question is can we

664
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:28,009
define a kind of query

665
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,339
p-taff row route the means if the node

666
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:34,490
need to search P Dow P Dow Road from

667
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:37,069
Road we need to provide a mechanism okay

668
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:40,328
so if I can reformulate white understand

669
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:43,690
my my understanding of the question is

670
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:47,599
basically who gets to tell the route

671
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:49,579
that there is a need to establish a path

672
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,170
between a and B and what are the

673
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,910
properties of that path the amount of

674
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,859
redundancy the kind of reliability want

675
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:58,790
to obtain basically what we call the

676
00:37:54,859 --> 00:38:00,609
traffic specifications in did not and in

677
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,589
the one hand it could be some

678
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:05,569
application somewhere in the cloud but

679
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:08,390
on the other hand it could be a node in

680
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:10,759
the network which decides it wants to

681
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:13,069
talk to another node in which case we

682
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,030
need signaling from that node to tell

683
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:17,450
the route please

684
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:20,420
I'm a and I want a projected route to be

685
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:23,060
yes right and and so we don't have

686
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,079
signaling for that it would be it would

687
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:28,910
be like a multi hub this or something

688
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,010
well well you know the node could tell a

689
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:34,549
mister route I want to project it down

690
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:35,880
to to be is it something want to include

691
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,920
in this document

692
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,650
so it was not in malleus that's just

693
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,270
lease proposal this question so I guess

694
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:45,080
it comes from operational requirements

695
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:48,660
right yes something we want in the field

696
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:51,270
so it seems there is a need for support

697
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:56,790
for the host there's a route I want to

698
00:38:51,270 --> 00:39:00,560
talk to mr. B so I'm sorry but no can we

699
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,560
are pushing some new staffing which is

700
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,410
Thank You Pascal

701
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,660
please check the open tickets here with

702
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,790
these out prediction trap and you let us

703
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,290
know if it's a dress or we should let

704
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:19,130
more information you think it's not

705
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:21,450
fully addressed well yeah

706
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,950
small question how do you see the

707
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,629
progress now will you first do the

708
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,210
modifications which have been proposed

709
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,010
here and people think and then you make

710
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:33,780
the publish it and then we start asking

711
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:37,560
for more more refuse study yes yes I

712
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:41,280
just want to know maybe Li you can post

713
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,700
to the mailing list a proposal like to

714
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,290
use a disk or something like that

715
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,210
you know it's probably something like

716
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:51,930
it's a message has to go all the way to

717
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:54,180
the root and and ask for a path with

718
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,919
certain characteristics and you need to

719
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,710
be able to express those characteristics

720
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,420
what I call T spec is three what in that

721
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,610
net we so we say we want this

722
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,410
reliability so the route has to

723
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,660
translate that oh do I can be able to

724
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,490
dag which is all those shades of gray if

725
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,440
I want to reliability of five nines that

726
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:13,979
mean I need five paths or something like

727
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,580
that I don't know with so much prae so

728
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,590
packet ribbons really be replication

729
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,930
elimination type of games you know or

730
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,490
cross three depends on the quality that

731
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:25,919
you want to obtain and the route cannot

732
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:28,700
complete the route if it doesn't know

733
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,480
the result that you want

734
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:39,240
like latency reliability you need some

735
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:42,390
some specifications like that rotting to

736
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,759
the leaf so this one is easier because I

737
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,620
mean you need to understand the PIO is a

738
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,900
big thing right it's okay it's a lot of

739
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,680
rockets taken time it's a big thing it's

740
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,140
just

741
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,020
it's like a ogv right it's it's a new

742
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,490
new way in repo we are using Sdn so

743
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,630
that's well it's no more that it takes

744
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,229
time and we have to think it through

745
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:03,650
because it's a big thing now the the

746
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:11,640
leaves the unaware leaf is a small thing

747
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:15,960
we we have created at five or five no no

748
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:20,009
that's the the one that you have at the

749
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:24,839
end of the agenda that's the turn on a

750
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:30,630
23 yes

751
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:34,770
leaves at the end so six will be up this

752
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:37,109
whole series of draft and what we're in

753
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,329
stressed transient right now is for now

754
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:41,549
is eight five four five eight five four

755
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:43,559
five is a host or router interface while

756
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:46,109
by a host registers to a router and

757
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,359
asked for some services and the service

758
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:51,839
can be rotting and BND proxy could be

759
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:54,598
anything else because it's extensible so

760
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,450
right now it was explicitly designed for

761
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,400
use case like cripple so when we rotate

762
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,980
five four five we made sure that what

763
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,770
ripple needs can be actually expressed

764
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,740
with our five five right but so now I'd

765
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,900
five four five gives let's the host tell

766
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,549
the Reaper router is what I want in a

767
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,549
way that the river Rother can turn it

768
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:17,099
into ripple the cool thing with that is

769
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:19,829
if you're low power device you don't

770
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:22,289
have to do six low pile and D which goes

771
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:25,500
all the way to the 6l BR and then Dow

772
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:27,240
which goes all the way to the root it's

773
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,220
just one of those two flow that happens

774
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,709
so you divide the amount of traffic

775
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:35,209
between the low power node and the

776
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:37,890
router you divide it by two and you also

777
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,720
/ to the traffic along the mesh because

778
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,029
you don't have the diode ack on the one

779
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,009
hand and the dow in the other actually

780
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:45,630
the draft allows to to make it so that

781
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,809
just sending the devil regenerates the

782
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:51,750
DAC at the root dividing the traffic by

783
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:53,760
two so good for low power good for for

784
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:57,119
the master okay so that that's pretty

785
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,760
much what this graph does in the future

786
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,130
as you can see we also have the address

787
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,450
protection and D which allows us to

788
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,700
prove the ownership of a

789
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,220
Russ writes now right now it's done on

790
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,609
the nd side it's not done on the repo

791
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:14,279
side meaning that if you have access to

792
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:17,940
the repo network you don't have zero

793
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,710
touch properties well by you could not

794
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,680
inject an address if you're on it right

795
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,420
now as soon as you get access to the

796
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,759
ripple Network you can send it out you

797
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,420
can send any Dao meaning that you can

798
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,730
claim your anyone right it's the old

799
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,460
wait before zero trust but now we're in

800
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:38,640
the zero trust world a PNG gives you a

801
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,680
trust on the nd level and in the future

802
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,720
I hope we extend it to the repo level

803
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,569
that we cannot inject an address that is

804
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,910
not owned basically so let's follow

805
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:50,520
future form now anywhere leaf is very

806
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:53,069
simple just covers eight five four five

807
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,920
translate that into repos saves off over

808
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,960
the traffic and all those leaves that

809
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,670
don't support ripple at all they'd have

810
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:05,180
no knowledge of repo that's what it is

811
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:09,780
for so that's pretty much the

812
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:13,560
expectation that we are working at so

813
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,990
like I said the the EDA exchange their

814
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,580
deck is now originated at the root so we

815
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:21,660
don't have to have both flows across

816
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,610
network thou is used as keep alive and

817
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,580
the draft enables to separate the Ripper

818
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:28,830
root and the 6lv are most of the case

819
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,840
they will be the same but we actually I

820
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,640
thought at first I thought I would

821
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,410
remove the section which allows it and

822
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,799
then I got use cases right actually

823
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:43,200
happens so so I finally let it the way

824
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:47,100
it is there is a limitation to it and

825
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:50,460
the limitation is that in the Dow that

826
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:58,860
is used to regenerate the dyrdek

827
00:44:50,460 --> 00:45:03,480
there is no concept of the the token

828
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:06,390
that what week another Rover in at 5:05

829
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,220
which used to be the MAC address so

830
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,200
normally when you build a doubt that you

831
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,990
need to place all the fields which were

832
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:16,049
in the ear option including this unique

833
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:17,229
ID that is the Rover but since we don't

834
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,690
have it in repo

835
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,630
we cannot actually originate it at the

836
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:26,530
root so so right now we say something we

837
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:28,750
aren't like it you just feel it to zero

838
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:33,579
and it can only only be a refresher you

839
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:36,280
know but an improvement we could do is

840
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:40,510
to to have something to place it in the

841
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:45,579
Dow so it's just change that we could be

842
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:47,650
making there was another nothing to

843
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:50,859
affecting day they discussion about to

844
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:52,990
merge like this and Pierre would merge

845
00:45:50,859 --> 00:45:54,759
we said it would but then since then

846
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:56,529
there were use cases that I was told

847
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,049
about use cases and just found some

848
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,510
where we we don't want to merge it's

849
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:03,280
actually separate an example of that is

850
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:06,130
if you have a backbone and the 6lv is

851
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,859
common to all all the mesh so the 6lv

852
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:11,200
are now is a central guy covering the

853
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:17,200
whole backbone and the root is still the

854
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,399
root of one t oday now separate so so so

855
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,078
for cases like that

856
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,690
and then then there is also another case

857
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:27,640
where you actually translate the data

858
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:29,440
into DHCP so if you actually have a DHCP

859
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,348
server you could you could use that to

860
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,640
to at least refresh the DHCP so what you

861
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:36,970
do is you get your address from DHCP

862
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:39,129
first but all the renew is actually done

863
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,379
this way so instead of doing it I could

864
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,390
do a DHCP renew and actually there are

865
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,690
still deployments which use DHCP like

866
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:48,400
ours to be honest so it's no it's it's

867
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,500
out of scope of this back but you can

868
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,240
actually do a DHCP renew as opposed to a

869
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:59,770
data so these are two use cases where I

870
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:03,359
used to me to split so so kept it you

871
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:07,930
know it did not it did not remove it but

872
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:10,569
for the straight operation of that if we

873
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:13,569
really want to do it well it would be

874
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:18,190
better to place the rather field in repo

875
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:21,549
and that will be useful I just told you

876
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:23,400
a soon we will want to do zero touch we

877
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:28,690
would want to be able to authenticate

878
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,970
that the address is owned as we inject

879
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,800
it in ripple

880
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:36,868
to do that you will need the rover field

881
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:39,000
anyway right so I'm tempted to ask a why

882
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:41,849
don't we already put the rover field in

883
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,690
the dowel right now so next we'll be

884
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:48,810
able to secure the injection of it out

885
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:51,329
because that's the tool to secure it I'm

886
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:55,460
open to it away today the refresher of

887
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:58,859
the dalbergia has the field set to zero

888
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,390
I'm let's sing in your opinion I don't

889
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:02,790
think people have time to think about

890
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:04,470
that so but that's pretty much the only

891
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:07,170
improvement they can think of in this

892
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:10,740
the in this draft changing the dowel to

893
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:14,700
place the rubber from 6lowpan into

894
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:24,930
ripple so that we can do this refresh up

895
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:27,480
there and there is nothing much I did

896
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:29,848
text which guy was cast on kind of an

897
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,130
object that if the leaf does not support

898
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:34,260
it 1 3 8 and it's not supposed to then

899
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,849
the IP an IP goes to the parent how do

900
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,530
you know that the IP IP goes to the

901
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:39,869
parents it's because the rod is injected

902
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:42,210
with a EP 8 which means X star in ripple

903
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:45,000
so basically if the roots is the e bit

904
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:49,790
set in the dowel then it needs to to I

905
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,790
pin IP to the parent not to the note

906
00:48:52,069 --> 00:49:05,040
think about kind comments what I've read

907
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:10,140
the draft well right now so let me point

908
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:22,290
it it's not a big drafts right yeah so

909
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:29,129
yes sorry we have four li hua all right

910
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:31,410
it's you did right so the only question

911
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,780
really is do we want to change the dowel

912
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:36,598
format or to put an option for the dowel

913
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:39,450
format in this bag so we can carry the

914
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:42,450
arrow and if we do that then we can redo

915
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:43,779
the proxy dialog from the root to the 6

916
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,689
lb are properly

917
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:51,370
we put that into the Megan list yesyes

918
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:53,530
so we get the discussion yep thank you I

919
00:49:51,370 --> 00:50:01,000
will do unless I forget right so if it's

920
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:05,110
in the minutes yes she can make that

921
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:10,210
initial teach it and so he's willing to

922
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:11,190
review the draft please thank you

923
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,740
Michael

924
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:17,890
who else where we are going to ask him

925
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,509
the Middle East so I'm looking at this

926
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:23,379
slide I made because there were

927
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:25,300
questions to the list so we get this

928
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:31,540
question on the mailing list whether we

929
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:32,860
should support meepo as well and well

930
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:36,279
I'm not too keen to be honest because

931
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:38,740
that's completely a news back but I'm

932
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:42,280
open to two arguments on that because

933
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:47,069
the clients could also Peter they could

934
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:50,110
also be people unaware kind of right so

935
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:52,480
do we need to do the same game from evil

936
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:59,290
and aware leaves what is there to be

937
00:50:52,480 --> 00:51:00,340
done and is it the same document part of

938
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:03,310
the middle prime is the hop-by-hop

939
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,050
cannot be ignored either all right so we

940
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,110
have the same prime for meepo as we did

941
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:09,340
with the ripple hop-by-hop

942
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:17,010
you have to translate it into something

943
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:21,160
can being northern gorilla Michael I

944
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:24,450
feel like maple is so much less well

945
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:28,029
understood in as a group and as

946
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:30,279
implementers that I wouldn't want to put

947
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,960
it in the same document for that reason

948
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,530
because I think we won't get what we

949
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:39,160
need actually sure that it's as big a

950
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:41,020
problem that's reunit cast because the

951
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:45,339
biggest problem we have in unicast is

952
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:47,170
that we with the unaware leaves is that

953
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:51,400
we don't know where they what what the

954
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:53,020
pot before them is right if we could

955
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,850
know what the hop would reliably what

956
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:57,190
the hop before them was they

957
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:58,690
and we would be able to put all these

958
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,070
artifacts addressed to them and they

959
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:04,420
could be removed in the unaware leave

960
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:06,550
just works right in unicast right the

961
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,710
problems we don't know that which is the

962
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:12,130
the issue and and and learning that is

963
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:14,380
hard and compensating for it is hard but

964
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:16,570
this is why I want to change the hub by

965
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:18,340
option 2 to D sure actually they need

966
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:20,500
other people back it to everybody well

967
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:23,080
so so I agree with you that that that

968
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:27,640
helps but I'm also saying suggesting

969
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:32,560
that for some unaware live leaves that

970
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:34,810
need to do nipple I'm actually finding

971
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,870
that a real stretch to conceive of but

972
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:40,509
maybe someone has a use case ok be

973
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:42,759
unless that me exactly seem completely

974
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,650
agree right personally right so so I'm

975
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,940
thinking about some really sleepy node

976
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:53,800
window break sensor or something like

977
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:56,290
that that is using nipple to I don't

978
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:59,140
know what but the point is that if it's

979
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:02,980
a really sleepy node something else is

980
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:04,870
going to have to door store so since

981
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,350
that thing is storing and since the the

982
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:10,600
middle packet is a new packet does being

983
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:13,450
sent we can send it

984
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,980
unicast if necessary with whatever else

985
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,319
because there has to be some kind of

986
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:19,720
thing happening there so maybe that

987
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,520
there's a bunch of cases that where we

988
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,910
think that it's nipple to the to the

989
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,070
leaf it doesn't actually have to be it

990
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,660
can be the last hop can be unicast and

991
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:33,370
therefore we do whatever we like because

992
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:36,670
it has to be stored anyway so I suggest

993
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:38,380
that I don't want to discourage you from

994
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:41,050
writing a document but I would suggest

995
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,850
that we need to actually kind of wit not

996
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:45,100
wait for someone to come up with a real

997
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:47,470
use case or a real situation where this

998
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,750
happens or as I feel in the unicast case

999
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:53,109
we kind of do know what is going on

1000
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:55,870
maybe Carsten and and the core and those

1001
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:59,230
people have a real use case that's going

1002
00:53:55,870 --> 00:54:00,370
to happen and that that would be great

1003
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,780
then we would know what we're dealing

1004
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,880
with

1005
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:07,150
yeah but but okay what you're telling us

1006
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,590
so far is there are a lot of unknowns we

1007
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,000
need a good description of the promised

1008
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,950
and then it's probably a separate

1009
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,130
document you don't bother the idea of

1010
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:19,629
doing it just say not this back let's

1011
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:24,550
publish this one yes pretty much do you

1012
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:27,670
agree with that Peter yeah me actually

1013
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:31,690
this is indeed a requirement from the

1014
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:33,520
deep sleep node that is really please

1015
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:39,210
you're supposed to speak your name

1016
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:42,250
solely ciao Anita a requirement from the

1017
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:47,410
parsnip note which need to support our

1018
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:51,670
way and where we meepo we cannot use

1019
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:56,140
unicast er to send the multicast packet

1020
00:54:51,670 --> 00:55:00,910
because it we are support image that if

1021
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:03,609
a thousand of people deep asleep node

1022
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:07,359
connect to one power node that you need

1023
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:11,620
to up to firm your operator for the tips

1024
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,870
of Noda we suppose to use multicast so

1025
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,430
it's better to support your deep sleep

1026
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:19,210
node actually synchronized to a

1027
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:21,460
broadcast schedule right yes they do at

1028
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:25,440
least that we need to support one kind

1029
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:31,540
of multicast whatever NPR or other

1030
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:33,460
Mallika's protocol Michael Richards can

1031
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,800
so that's wonderful that's great use

1032
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,660
case in and I get what you're saying but

1033
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:43,200
what I'm what I'm trying to say is that

1034
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:46,350
because the packet going out is

1035
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:49,060
different than the packet coming in and

1036
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:53,290
none of those sleepy noes are expected

1037
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:55,930
to relay the note are they no because

1038
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:58,390
they're too sleepy to do that so it's it

1039
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:01,359
seems acceptable that we send can send a

1040
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:03,069
different set of headers on that

1041
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:07,590
multicast cuz we're not expecting that

1042
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:10,000
that that packet to get relayed again

1043
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:14,410
right all we can expect them to adjust

1044
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,760
ignore all the the 6002 deride oh well

1045
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,859
that would be what the document would

1046
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,120
then say could we could put it in and

1047
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,890
they could ignore it but that requires

1048
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,549
them to change

1049
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:24,470
no if we make it too

1050
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,150
we need to change meatball right because

1051
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:27,620
we make every change it change nipple

1052
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,540
but but I'm saying what I'm trying to

1053
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:32,330
say is that if if you've got the

1054
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,220
synchronization it's happening and none

1055
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:37,069
of those nodes that are expected to

1056
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:40,220
receive that message during that wake-up

1057
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:42,680
period are expected to relay but then

1058
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:44,899
then there's no point in inputting any

1059
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,359
headers on it's just a late just a local

1060
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:50,210
multicast if some of them are going to

1061
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,010
relay and some of them will not because

1062
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:54,590
they're sleepy and they're all waking up

1063
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:56,480
at that time then it makes sense to do

1064
00:56:54,590 --> 00:57:00,170
that in that particular use case I

1065
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:03,020
understand that the unaware leaves are

1066
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:06,380
really leaves it's part of being unaware

1067
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:08,150
is being leaves right it's kind of right

1068
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:12,920
so you don't rely I mean it's part of

1069
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:16,310
the terminology here right beautiful no

1070
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,200
stock no small remark I don't think if

1071
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:20,240
you do maple in this document because it

1072
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:23,359
is a completely different protocol with

1073
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,459
repeaters etc so the problem is

1074
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,590
completely different so not discussed

1075
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:32,150
here otherwise sing around don't not

1076
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:33,830
quite sure what about trickle it's not

1077
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:35,120
maple this trick of it is for the

1078
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:37,130
distribution of knowledge through the

1079
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,109
whole and network right but what what

1080
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:40,790
else interesting do I I need some trick

1081
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:45,470
on this document or what I mean I don't

1082
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:47,300
see why you're ringing you mean for the

1083
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:50,240
meatball story right no for the trickle

1084
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,920
you have to track oh okay this document

1085
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,419
I'm asking do you want me to change this

1086
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,690
document say something about trickle

1087
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,430
roof I was afraid you wanted me to do to

1088
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,020
say it's something about trickle here so

1089
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:02,240
what so true you want to talk about

1090
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:04,640
trickle in another document to solve

1091
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,529
what not to solve if you have a maple

1092
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,299
problem we should say look also they

1093
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,960
take up a problem and not discuss it

1094
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,990
here okay

1095
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:16,100
I'd fine and I've seen yeah yeah yeah

1096
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:18,770
sure and meepo is interleaved with

1097
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,120
trickle you might be so it's it's a long

1098
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,009
consideration you're telling us

1099
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,150
basically it's not just a side effect of

1100
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:28,840
this document so I agree with that

1101
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:28,840
and I think what's wrong

1102
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,399
[Music]

1103
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:39,740
yeah so if you have if you see that we

1104
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:42,500
are missing something from a plane

1105
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:45,379
unaware leave now is the right time to

1106
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:49,070
say because I hope we go with this

1107
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:51,410
document to last call very soon the only

1108
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:55,520
thing I see missing right now is whether

1109
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:58,970
we push the rover in the Dow or not well

1110
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,750
if you make complete a ticket and let's

1111
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:04,220
go because we need the ingredients

1112
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:07,640
either I do it or not and then we go

1113
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:10,250
yeah when it's reducing as well premiums

1114
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,930
we need the reviews yes obviously that's

1115
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:15,440
part of going well our best goal is to

1116
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:17,870
get all those regions now if some if you

1117
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,820
could find one or two reviews right now

1118
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:29,240
that would speed the process right she

1119
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:31,340
can advance a little baby okay not so

1120
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:34,009
much people have read this document but

1121
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:37,340
please who is willing to review Michael

1122
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:48,400
you raise their hands right yes thank

1123
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:48,400
you what it who else okay thank you

1124
00:59:50,410 --> 01:00:00,790
yes no no I'm no not people thank you

1125
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:00,790
Pascal pretty much

1126
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:27,799
so it's George from him to Atlantic this

1127
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:32,120
is the update from the version zero one

1128
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:34,720
so we have this equation zero for I will

1129
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:37,670
go to the next slide one of the details

1130
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:41,600
so first of all many thanks to Dominique

1131
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:43,730
Diego Arun Abbas Carla so to Dominican

1132
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:48,710
to Diego for the thorough review so we

1133
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:50,150
got a bunch of comments and then are all

1134
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:52,970
named Pascal for the discussions we had

1135
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:57,770
the mailing list so the main changes

1136
01:00:52,970 --> 01:01:00,890
that we got to zero for is but now we

1137
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:03,800
are having the common ancestors define a

1138
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:09,440
subjective function it is draft in three

1139
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:12,190
different patterns then we change the

1140
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,870
title to reflect the change of the

1141
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:19,390
common ancestor objective functions so

1142
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:22,520
have a new title in this document then

1143
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:24,319
so the common ancestor pattern is not

1144
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,960
anymore as an example in the document

1145
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:31,190
but it is as objective function so it is

1146
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:34,100
a prescriptive prescriptive next thing

1147
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:38,210
is the next big thing that we changed is

1148
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:41,089
that we removed any reference that we

1149
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:46,570
had about six Laura or six law I don't

1150
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:52,760
know how to pronounce this yeah yes

1151
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:56,030
which lures load/unload where H ok so we

1152
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,830
remove so there's no conflict this based

1153
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:00,710
on the discussions we had with Pascal

1154
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:05,410
with Dominic about this about this point

1155
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:08,240
and the third yeah there were like many

1156
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:12,560
comments on the ability improvement so

1157
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:17,290
we address these ports as well but sort

1158
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:22,540
of the main changes and so before

1159
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:25,119
asking for the w GLS if there will be

1160
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:28,119
any other if it's necessary to have any

1161
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:30,640
other review round of reviews to see

1162
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:34,020
about the structure or the new version

1163
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,020
that we have now a subjective function

1164
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:41,170
so this is a question to the church

1165
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:48,640
shall we call it now or you want us to

1166
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:50,590
call it Singapore do you think it's

1167
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,720
complete or do you still see problems

1168
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:54,700
which are going have to be solved you

1169
01:02:52,720 --> 01:03:00,069
seem rather confident that the thing is

1170
01:02:54,700 --> 01:03:02,589
rounded clear finished so were like two

1171
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:05,100
things and now it's the big tube the two

1172
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:08,590
big things that we solved the one was

1173
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:11,799
the sixth floor H and the other ones the

1174
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:13,480
the objective function to be defined so

1175
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,750
we follow the discussion based on the

1176
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,640
comments reviews and the mailing list

1177
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:24,670
and we do not have any other big issue

1178
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:28,930
to come on our hello everyone

1179
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:32,130
so if something would be helpful if you

1180
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:35,919
if someone would take a look is actually

1181
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:38,820
a bit maybe an editorial issue so the

1182
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:42,810
way we defined the objective function is

1183
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:45,280
what would be the equivalent of an

1184
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:47,410
object-oriented the extension of mr.

1185
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:52,420
Hoff so we took basically every section

1186
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:53,950
in the mr. Hoff RFC and we said how our

1187
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,430
objective function is different because

1188
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:59,560
basically it's an extension of mr. Hoff

1189
01:03:56,430 --> 01:04:01,810
so I'm not sure I haven't done this

1190
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:05,320
before I'm not sure this is the correct

1191
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:08,490
or incorrect way to do it so maybe some

1192
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,490
feedback on that would be useful

1193
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:21,869
thank your is um who's being to review

1194
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:21,869
the that Pascal you

1195
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:27,720
the meek thank you very much it'll be

1196
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:29,220
quick Dominica means everything's the

1197
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:36,230
same has just changed the structure

1198
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:38,730
actually yes me too

1199
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:43,050
Ramos I think what you did is exactly

1200
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:45,780
okay I had the same discussion about how

1201
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:50,700
the fragmentation updates or does not

1202
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:52,770
update existing documents when you say I

1203
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,230
update and when you say you don't in

1204
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:57,240
this case you are not updating mr. half

1205
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:59,670
because mr. half steel stands as it is

1206
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:02,250
for the use case you're just in

1207
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,790
everything from it in inject that you're

1208
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,740
using

1209
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:06,390
what you don't modify the way it already

1210
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:08,790
exists and then there are things you

1211
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:10,470
magnify so I think it's perfectly okay

1212
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:13,920
to express it this way and you don't

1213
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:15,870
need to say you update mr. half but you

1214
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,120
can say you should have a section saying

1215
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:25,230
I'm extending mr. half and your option

1216
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:27,870
is I'm doing on top of it yes yeah and I

1217
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:29,280
think it's perfect just expressing what

1218
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:31,620
we have and making sure everybody agrees

1219
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:36,290
but we are doing the exact same way in

1220
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:36,290
other drawers and it seems to be okay

1221
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:44,550
yeah just commending I looked at the

1222
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,050
diff and it's hardly no more than one

1223
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:49,470
page of difference so it's pretty easy

1224
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:51,930
to read but the point I was I wanted to

1225
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:54,990
make is that then we have to go back to

1226
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:56,879
mr. off to see exactly what additions

1227
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:59,430
you're placing on it said that's the

1228
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,220
most I make emilyschutt

1229
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:04,049
preference then I'm just saying okay you

1230
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:07,379
said it's easy it will be easy it will

1231
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:09,450
be quick as I said the changes in your

1232
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,280
draft is a small but the implications

1233
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:12,629
are that you have to go back and read

1234
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,120
mr. Huff again in which are you

1235
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:18,420
understanding activity so a little bit

1236
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:20,819
of what step maybe maybe a small remark

1237
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,310
is on what Pascal was saying before so

1238
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:25,920
since we removed all the references

1239
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:27,810
about the compression at the da-jung for

1240
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,400
the sixth floor so I binned it was a

1241
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:33,390
good idea of having a new document maybe

1242
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:35,400
how to compress the control plane can be

1243
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:39,058
another document to to

1244
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:41,039
all together potentially thank you and

1245
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:42,869
so we have two reviewers Dominique and

1246
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:45,049
Raul thank you very much guys thanks so

1247
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:45,049
much guys

1248
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:54,690
the rest are just back up slides but I'm

1249
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:59,339
not sure if it's necessary both some

1250
01:06:54,690 --> 01:07:13,140
comments questions who have read it this

1251
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:18,000
document this document we saw the

1252
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:20,759
implementation here you have many

1253
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:30,230
research papers we are even teaching

1254
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:30,230
this to the school now I know it's great

1255
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:40,890
so what do we do is research so we need

1256
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:44,190
the total reviews of Dominique and row

1257
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:48,529
and then we can great and then we go to

1258
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:48,529
for last call lovely thank you thank you

1259
01:07:55,609 --> 01:08:00,119
here I just have a question for some of

1260
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:03,470
the people that have just presented some

1261
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:06,599
things mentioned you're teaching them

1262
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:10,618
yeah so I have a question I'm not

1263
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:13,440
exactly related to the group but is ietf

1264
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:15,569
interest the documents that you're

1265
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,670
writing are they're being counted by

1266
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:21,238
your professional tenure review

1267
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:24,029
committees no okay just curious if that

1268
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:30,718
was something something better in your

1269
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:32,339
world that I so much concur with Michael

1270
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,158
there is a big problem with our Asian

1271
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:37,920
IGF and academia is that the RFC should

1272
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:40,198
be counted look a look at Google Scholar

1273
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,658
right it counts patents it counts

1274
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:45,269
documents normal publications and it

1275
01:08:42,658 --> 01:08:46,948
counts RFC's all that are valid

1276
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,750
documents I mean we really need to work

1277
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:49,240
hard with the academia to get our our

1278
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:55,540
public

1279
01:08:49,240 --> 01:09:15,880
she's recognized okay thank you guys so

1280
01:08:55,540 --> 01:09:21,609
now we have no we don't or what sorry no

1281
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:26,590
I shouldn't have that word hello Hiram

1282
01:09:21,609 --> 01:09:29,979
can you hear me okay okay right so I'll

1283
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:35,340
start so Java from harbor technologies

1284
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:35,339
I'm going to talk about I love extreme

1285
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:43,629
so we can have good return thank you so

1286
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:45,429
just let me know and I can advance so

1287
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:48,340
the talk is about I'm going to talk

1288
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:50,020
about emoji extinction which is a pretty

1289
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,960
straightforward thing to do the

1290
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:54,660
proposition is very straightforward and

1291
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:58,300
the other thing is the capabilities

1292
01:09:54,660 --> 01:10:00,550
handshake which in my opinion is a

1293
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:03,250
little bit complex is definitely more

1294
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:04,510
complex than M okay extension both of

1295
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:08,350
the things are handled in the same

1296
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:10,000
document now well the need for a mopey

1297
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:12,460
extension the mode of operation

1298
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,620
extension is quite straightforward we

1299
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:17,560
already have existing drafts which are

1300
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:19,800
eager to use new mo peas and we have

1301
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:24,490
already exhausted the existing mo fees

1302
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:26,680
what is an MLP it's it specifies it

1303
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:29,590
mandates the primitives to be supported

1304
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:31,870
by the 6lr if a node has to join as a

1305
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:33,460
6lr in the network it has to support the

1306
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,620
mode of operation if it doesn't support

1307
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:38,800
the mode of operation then it has to it

1308
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:40,510
can it can join as a leaf node it's

1309
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,540
three bits in size and it's already

1310
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:45,250
exhausted you can see in the bottom

1311
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:47,560
right-hand side that there are existing

1312
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:57,350
documents waiting to be using those

1313
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:59,960
course next like this like aiya so

1314
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:02,630
moppy extension option this is a new

1315
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,360
option that is introduced it's a pretty

1316
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:07,460
straightforward option now one one one

1317
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:09,650
question here would be the extended mo

1318
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,330
p-value if you see the number of bits

1319
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:14,660
that have allocated for extended mo

1320
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:17,420
p-value is quite high and I am not sure

1321
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:20,269
if those many extended mo P values would

1322
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:22,040
indeed be required in the future the

1323
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:24,110
reason why I ask is this directly

1324
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:30,640
impacts the control over head of the TI

1325
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:33,830
o so so I am considering maybe

1326
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:38,930
shortening the size of the six extended

1327
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:41,360
mo p-value here if there is any feedback

1328
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:46,790
from the working group in this context I

1329
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:48,280
would like to understand next slide

1330
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:55,570
please

1331
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:58,190
yeah thank you I was thinking that

1332
01:11:55,570 --> 01:12:01,160
usually you've got a type and subtype

1333
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:02,599
like sometimes you have something like

1334
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:06,349
snoring and then you could have

1335
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:09,770
variations of it right right now we kind

1336
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:14,480
of have collections of bits and each one

1337
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:16,460
seems to be either/or like you know you

1338
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,070
could have both like your these are your

1339
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,960
these are your that I want to make sure

1340
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:22,849
that we express things in a fashion that

1341
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,500
you can have these these this and that

1342
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:28,910
so you set multiple bits so there is a

1343
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:31,100
main thing and then some options so just

1344
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:33,650
what offer we express it but today right

1345
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:36,740
all the maps are exclusive that's why

1346
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:39,379
I'm saying you got a mix of throwing a

1347
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:41,120
non-story but what we want to extend in

1348
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:43,850
the extension want to be able to do some

1349
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,450
mixers like I can have a mix of non

1350
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:51,380
stirring and projected broth just to

1351
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:55,160
give you an example now in main rods and

1352
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:57,410
projected storing mode rods or mix of a

1353
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:00,380
non storing projection I don't know so

1354
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:02,720
we just don't want exclusive rights like

1355
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:04,610
this is exactly what is thought about

1356
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,830
when writing this chart and that's when

1357
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:09,170
I thought about introducing capabilities

1358
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:11,070
you know so if if we have something

1359
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:12,990
which goes

1360
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:15,540
along with the existing mo P then we can

1361
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:17,790
Ricky we can we can handle it in the

1362
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:19,250
form of capabilities this is what I was

1363
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:23,700
thinking

1364
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:25,740
does that make sense I mean if there is

1365
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:28,230
any existing if there are any any any

1366
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,639
new set of options that go along with

1367
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:32,219
the existing a movie those could be

1368
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:38,820
those to be expressed in the form of

1369
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:44,790
capabilities is what I'm thinking yes

1370
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:48,690
right I think I think that both right

1371
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:49,650
capabilities can be is it's more like I

1372
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:54,240
can do that

1373
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:57,330
right di yo mobile for Parisienne is

1374
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:58,740
here is how this network works it's not

1375
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:03,300
that it's capable of doing something

1376
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:06,139
that's the way it works so I'd like to

1377
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:08,610
use the map for what the map is and say

1378
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:10,650
it's an on storing and it's using

1379
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:14,250
projected Road storing a non-story I

1380
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:16,530
don't know and if the rules are if you

1381
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:19,740
can't you know do those things then you

1382
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:22,019
don't join this network as a router you

1383
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:26,550
have a leaf at best the rules are

1384
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:28,140
located but much this thing capability

1385
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:31,020
is different that I can do this that's

1386
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:32,670
nice use it or not and then there is

1387
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:36,650
another thing which which which is

1388
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:40,560
needed in the in the in your draft is I

1389
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:44,929
can do it and it's on all rights off for

1390
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:47,010
instance you're using use of ripple info

1391
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:48,990
okay there is a hop-by-hop

1392
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:51,440
that well there's a new up I hope there

1393
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:54,179
is this new flag in the DIA which says a

1394
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:57,120
it's all no itself it's controlled

1395
01:14:54,180 --> 01:15:00,450
on/off by the route but what did the

1396
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:02,160
node receive it did not apply it so the

1397
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:05,340
node is asked to be capable of

1398
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,530
supporting the new hub I hope that's one

1399
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,480
thing so it's a capability and then it

1400
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:11,400
has okay I'm using it right now so I

1401
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:15,089
understood what the route told me and I

1402
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,830
switched it on which is next to

1403
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:19,410
capability but it's actually actually

1404
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:22,650
how I use it right now so also all this

1405
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:24,880
is more right it's a bit more one

1406
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:28,719
example just I want to go here

1407
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,940
so if you see the existing mo piece we

1408
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:32,590
have storing mode of operation and then

1409
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,860
we have storing mode of operation with

1410
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:40,360
multicast support those use two

1411
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:42,098
different mo piece and I don't see any

1412
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,480
other way of using it so something if

1413
01:15:42,099 --> 01:15:46,270
something is mandatory it will

1414
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:51,369
eventually end up taking a new mode of

1415
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:53,230
operation maybe I'm not have not fully

1416
01:15:51,369 --> 01:15:56,429
got just of what you are trying to say

1417
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:59,379
maybe you can discuss this offline but

1418
01:15:56,429 --> 01:16:02,560
if there are things which have to be

1419
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:04,329
manually supported by the 6l ours then

1420
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,230
they go in as a new mo p value

1421
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:07,329
altogether

1422
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:09,549
the problem with this approach is you

1423
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:11,349
have multiple set for example you have

1424
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:12,520
multicast support and you have storing

1425
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:14,290
mode of operation and all the

1426
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:24,280
permutations all the combinations will

1427
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:26,130
have to become a new mo p value so let's

1428
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,420
differentiate what goes in the

1429
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:31,540
configuration option and what goes in

1430
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:35,800
the MRP in the contribution option you

1431
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:37,360
can turn something or not in the ARP you

1432
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,060
are capable of doing it or you don't

1433
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,739
join the network so if we want to build

1434
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:43,840
a network and we need projected route

1435
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:45,400
then you need to have the bits which you

1436
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,409
are used to for the storing and on

1437
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,659
storing you also need to have the bits

1438
01:16:47,409 --> 01:16:51,519
which they would say oh we're using

1439
01:16:49,659 --> 01:16:53,079
Project instance projection storing and

1440
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,320
polishing non storing and that gives you

1441
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:58,030
an array of bits in the map here and if

1442
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,650
you want join us a router you need to

1443
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:03,929
support all those bits otherwise you

1444
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:05,799
don't join or leave kind of now the

1445
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:07,329
configuration option some time you don't

1446
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,969
even know you don't know right because

1447
01:17:07,329 --> 01:17:11,530
those bits are reserved until I used so

1448
01:17:09,969 --> 01:17:13,840
that's part of the progress if you don't

1449
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:15,550
know that you don't this bit is now

1450
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,440
meaningful then you cannot know you

1451
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:23,619
don't support it so you can't add to say

1452
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:26,469
you join on it on join Michael alright

1453
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:28,030
so Fran awaits in the next so the next

1454
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:30,159
thing in this in this draft is about

1455
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:33,250
capabilities which which essentially

1456
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:37,329
indicate the set of features which could

1457
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:38,320
possibly mandatory or optional so so the

1458
01:17:37,329 --> 01:17:39,880
new specs which

1459
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:43,049
finds the new capability indicate

1460
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:46,659
whether it is mandatory or optional and

1461
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:49,420
that the the existing craft would

1462
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:51,480
provide some some recommendations or at

1463
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:54,520
least some some some basic rules as to

1464
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:58,570
what have to be minimally specified for

1465
01:17:54,520 --> 01:18:00,090
every new capability now why a mu P by

1466
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:03,400
itself is not sufficient well it is

1467
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:06,579
pretty much clear that mo P mandates the

1468
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:09,219
primitives while capabilities are not

1469
01:18:06,579 --> 01:18:11,860
mandated in those can be optional

1470
01:18:09,219 --> 01:18:14,320
features and unlike a mu P capabilities

1471
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:16,750
can be negotiated we have a three-way

1472
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:18,759
handshake in a form of D iota and our

1473
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:24,329
work and capabilities can be sent as

1474
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,329
part of the Felicity's annex like this

1475
01:18:28,889 --> 01:18:36,760
next like this yak slide please

1476
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:38,619
if I may say Raul also a capability is

1477
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,570
not a little bit right for instance we

1478
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:45,030
need for the projection the capability

1479
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:47,110
to tell the route I can get one of the

1480
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:50,349
maximum that you can program but do you

1481
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:51,969
think that should go in every capability

1482
01:18:50,349 --> 01:18:55,900
might have some additional information

1483
01:18:51,969 --> 01:18:58,389
that needs to be specified now-now-now

1484
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:01,379
it's it's not possible for the

1485
01:18:58,389 --> 01:19:04,449
capability bit by itself to actually

1486
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:06,099
cover all those cases so I am assuming

1487
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:13,360
once you have the capability options

1488
01:19:06,099 --> 01:19:15,159
there will be other sub objects exactly

1489
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,348
you need to provide the container and

1490
01:19:15,159 --> 01:19:20,409
then in the projection I will provide

1491
01:19:17,349 --> 01:19:23,710
the sub options I mean dated T RVs that

1492
01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:27,610
tell what I need to provide the envelope

1493
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:28,690
floret okay so as of now the the

1494
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:29,409
capability options are pretty

1495
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:34,000
straightforward

1496
01:19:29,409 --> 01:19:36,699
we just have a series of bits which are

1497
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,409
dedicated as capability flags each of

1498
01:19:36,699 --> 01:19:40,199
this capability flag will be defined as

1499
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:43,420
a different time in as part of the news

1500
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:45,080
new specification or as part of any new

1501
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:47,630
any other work

1502
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,100
this this draft only specifies the

1503
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:52,670
capability options as in the number of

1504
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:56,330
bits that have to be carried the next

1505
01:19:52,670 --> 01:20:00,110
next light weighs now the use case for

1506
01:19:56,330 --> 01:20:02,480
route using the capabilities the route

1507
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:04,190
can signal all the nodes in the in the

1508
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:08,570
network what capabilities route support

1509
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:10,940
in the response you have no node sending

1510
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:13,460
the dow responding with its own

1511
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:15,830
capabilities and in the Dow I possibly

1512
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:18,190
route can tell the node whether it is

1513
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:21,230
okay to continue with such a capability

1514
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:23,419
the three-way handshake again has to be

1515
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:25,429
has to be mentioned as part of the spec

1516
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:27,440
which defines a new capability whether

1517
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:29,000
it requires with whether it essentially

1518
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,339
requires such a three-way handshake or

1519
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,770
or whether it is okay just to say that I

1520
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:37,100
support this and then stop it I it

1521
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:40,130
completely depends upon the new

1522
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:45,800
capability that has to be support next

1523
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:49,010
like this now now this this slide is

1524
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:51,410
interesting because it allows so what

1525
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:53,930
does like tells you is there could be

1526
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:56,059
six LR nodes in between who are also

1527
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:58,250
sending which are also sending the iOS

1528
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,990
and there has been there are

1529
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:03,080
capabilities from the root node and and

1530
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:06,019
sister nodes which the 6lr receives is

1531
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:10,220
would it be okay for this 6lr to mask

1532
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:12,920
some of the capabilities because so that

1533
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:14,600
is something that is not there in the

1534
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:17,000
draft as of now has not been discussed

1535
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:19,370
in the draft as of now but that

1536
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,570
certainly seems to be possible that

1537
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:24,590
certainly seems to be technically

1538
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:29,049
feasible to handle it in this chart so

1539
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:29,050
yeah next next slide please

1540
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:39,049
yeah that's a very interesting question

1541
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:41,510
how because this is not duration option

1542
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:43,670
this is very very different yeah the

1543
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:46,070
configuration option cannot be masked

1544
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:47,990
draw cannot be modified at all because

1545
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:51,530
that's the configuration of the do dang

1546
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:54,530
now this one gives capabilities and for

1547
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:55,960
instance a parent can could have maximum

1548
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:59,179
100 children I don't know

1549
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:01,040
and it might be useful and we know it's

1550
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,960
useful to be able to express number on

1551
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:05,120
you have or no more frauds that you have

1552
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,770
in storing mode so that people would

1553
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,590
prefer to join someone else because

1554
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:11,240
you're reaching your maximum in that

1555
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:12,980
case obviously it seems that some

1556
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:16,880
capabilities have to be written or

1557
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:18,500
rewritten as you go right so certainly

1558
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,390
the kept of it is not something that

1559
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,190
comes from the root so if you want to

1560
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:24,800
have root capabilities then in the

1561
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:28,070
separate entry that cannot be modified

1562
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:31,250
but then you chef you know kappa other

1563
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:33,920
capabilities you know essentially what

1564
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:36,800
happens is depending upon the individual

1565
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,720
capabilities that are defined the the

1566
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,090
the new specs have to tell whether this

1567
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:48,260
capabilities can be modified on the

1568
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:52,760
intermediates excel hours next next like

1569
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:55,580
this so some of the other points to work

1570
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:57,560
upon is or some of the other points that

1571
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:59,630
I would like to mention here is the

1572
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,250
capabilities and the mobis even though

1573
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:02,630
they are as part of the same drafts are

1574
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:05,270
completely exclusive and they are not

1575
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:07,400
dependent upon each other the

1576
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:09,620
capabilities can be made use of with

1577
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,440
existing mo keys as well it is it is

1578
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,760
technically possible to use existing mo

1579
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:16,190
pieces

1580
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,520
secondly the capabilities are going to

1581
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:21,830
introduce new control and so is it would

1582
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:24,170
it be possible for would it be possible

1583
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:29,240
to LA he lied these capability options

1584
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:31,960
if it is if it is not I mean I mean it

1585
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:34,460
should be possible to not send every di

1586
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:36,170
di message with this capability option

1587
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:37,580
so I'm considering whether whether the

1588
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:39,260
i/o configuration just like a DI

1589
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:43,309
configuration option this can be lighted

1590
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:45,110
or not then we have our now reducing the

1591
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:49,700
control overhead of more pegs might be

1592
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:54,679
more challenging so I don't know how how

1593
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:56,240
this can be achieved but but yeah we are

1594
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,610
open to any feedback from the working

1595
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,580
group on how this can be achievable

1596
01:23:57,610 --> 01:24:03,910
there is no control order of morphix

1597
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:03,910
annex like this

1598
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,590
so there has been a use case already

1599
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:13,580
discussed on the mailing list about the

1600
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:15,560
turn on sex lawyer RH and I just wanted

1601
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:18,140
to throat a proposition here that rather

1602
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:22,010
than using a configuration flag for

1603
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:24,620
setting the t flag in in in the bi-lo

1604
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:28,070
configuration option wouldn't it be more

1605
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:29,840
easier or more feasible to handle it as

1606
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:32,900
part of the capabilities option itself

1607
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:36,110
so that we don't have to change out of

1608
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:39,799
6550 and this this is just something

1609
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:44,030
that that I want to float and this is

1610
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:49,130
something that I thought about next like

1611
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:51,500
this and thank you thank you George's

1612
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:53,390
for this for the review we had made

1613
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,310
several updates post that one of the

1614
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:57,080
things that is updated is the

1615
01:24:55,310 --> 01:25:02,030
clarification that mopix

1616
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:03,650
if it is absent and if the base mo p

1617
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,790
suggest that my mopix should be present

1618
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:07,009
then how it should be handled by the

1619
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:08,960
implementation secondly it has been made

1620
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:12,320
explicit whether cap and more pics are

1621
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,610
are mutually exclusive and the detail I

1622
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,179
and I considerations have been added to

1623
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:22,820
the yeah Michael that's the end of the

1624
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:24,950
slides are they usually yes they might I

1625
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,679
mean I don't have all the individual

1626
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:35,300
capabilities actually depends on their

1627
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:36,740
movie Oh Michaels here so mutually

1628
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:38,450
exclusive would mean that I couldn't put

1629
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:45,290
them in a month that is in the same

1630
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:51,889
packet what sorry exclusive would mean

1631
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:54,260
is care for a cap you know what I mean

1632
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:56,570
what I meant or suffered ideas the mo

1633
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:58,370
penis is religion so you don't have to

1634
01:25:56,570 --> 01:26:00,019
support a certain mo P to support

1635
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:02,330
capabilities as well you can have

1636
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:04,790
capability options and the more pecs in

1637
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:11,829
the same D our message that is certainly

1638
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:13,419
possible okay okay okay

1639
01:26:11,829 --> 01:26:15,909
okay I think those words are not what

1640
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:17,800
you mean all right because the wrong

1641
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:22,018
words because I think that would be

1642
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:24,369
confusing but so I have some comments

1643
01:26:22,019 --> 01:26:26,349
Michael Richardson here about the sites

1644
01:26:24,369 --> 01:26:27,549
not avoiding to the end I did scan

1645
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:31,269
through your draft as he started

1646
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:33,459
speaking I hadn't read it before and I

1647
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:36,219
have I first of all I think it's a very

1648
01:26:33,459 --> 01:26:41,320
good idea I think we should immediately

1649
01:26:36,219 --> 01:26:43,780
adopt it I don't know if we should split

1650
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:48,129
it into a cap document and a mop packs

1651
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:50,949
document there the pushback is you know

1652
01:26:48,129 --> 01:26:53,229
too many documents right as far as I can

1653
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:57,308
see the two concepts are are completely

1654
01:26:53,229 --> 01:27:00,609
independent right and maybe one will

1655
01:26:57,309 --> 01:27:01,929
take longer than the other or you know I

1656
01:27:00,609 --> 01:27:03,909
don't know I don't know the answer that

1657
01:27:01,929 --> 01:27:09,760
question maybe our ad can tell us at

1658
01:27:03,909 --> 01:27:12,999
some point I I read about the MA packs

1659
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:15,550
that if the ma packs is seven sorry if

1660
01:27:12,999 --> 01:27:17,469
the moth is seven then you add the

1661
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:19,959
number that you find in the mop X to

1662
01:27:17,469 --> 01:27:22,989
that value so effectively you will get

1663
01:27:19,959 --> 01:27:26,260
numbers in the mop zero through six and

1664
01:27:22,989 --> 01:27:28,839
then the first number in the mop X will

1665
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:31,539
be zero meaning its rights the mop is

1666
01:27:28,839 --> 01:27:34,149
seven right and we have we basically

1667
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:38,409
extend you exactly adding to it okay

1668
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:42,249
that's what I understood okay okay so I

1669
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:45,879
think that's a bad idea I think that we

1670
01:27:42,249 --> 01:27:50,499
should put when the mop is seven then I

1671
01:27:45,879 --> 01:27:52,809
think real mop is in the mop X and yes

1672
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:54,999
you could put seven in the mop and then

1673
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:57,789
two in the mop X which would get

1674
01:27:54,999 --> 01:27:59,559
whatever the value two was which is may

1675
01:27:57,789 --> 01:28:01,300
be redundant you'd be stupid to do that

1676
01:27:59,559 --> 01:28:04,329
but I think that will be simpler to

1677
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:06,820
understand and simpler to code right if

1678
01:28:04,329 --> 01:28:08,949
this number is seven then the real

1679
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:10,929
number is here I'm using two hands that

1680
01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:12,669
you can't see okay I think that'll be

1681
01:28:10,929 --> 01:28:15,249
easier and less confusing to code as

1682
01:28:12,669 --> 01:28:17,320
opposed to adding the two things and

1683
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:18,879
someone will get something wrong by

1684
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:21,068
putting negative numbers or something

1685
01:28:18,879 --> 01:28:23,699
like that or fine extending something

1686
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:25,650
okay I too

1687
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:27,419
do you want to respond to that Pascal uh

1688
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:30,210
yeah I would like to react on that one

1689
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:32,130
please I wasn't with person concur with

1690
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:35,040
mic on that what I wanted to wait for

1691
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:36,840
and raise the might say that and also to

1692
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:39,480
answer you on the other thing you said

1693
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:42,000
is hug by compress things well because

1694
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:44,250
seven says that the map is in the MOU

1695
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,719
text it also means that if you don't

1696
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:47,820
have a map extent you have to wait for

1697
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:49,830
next year you to know what the map is so

1698
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:51,660
you compress it right it's kind of

1699
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:53,580
obvious once you have adapted Michael's

1700
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:55,650
proposal that you can compress the map

1701
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:57,570
back so I lied it no when you want to

1702
01:28:55,650 --> 01:29:00,330
alight it just by saying eh it's not

1703
01:28:57,570 --> 01:29:02,340
there in seven if the map is not there

1704
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:03,420
and you have seven that means wait for

1705
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,330
the next yeah you to know what the map

1706
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:09,239
is that comes with it it's just all

1707
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:11,040
right not at all so good I don't think I

1708
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:12,809
don't know if you have enough that your

1709
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:18,719
question is do you have too many bits

1710
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:21,480
for the math X maybe I don't think the

1711
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:23,219
mop X should be bit encoded I think

1712
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:25,139
Pascal was thinking you know there would

1713
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:30,120
be a bit here and a bit there I think

1714
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:31,620
that yes we have an a cross product of

1715
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:34,050
different kinds of things that we need

1716
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:36,000
to do not all those cross products will

1717
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:39,650
make sense okay

1718
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,510
having a bit field is hard to compress

1719
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:44,489
compressing it to an integer for the

1720
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:47,280
ones that we care about is probably

1721
01:29:44,489 --> 01:29:51,030
better for compression so if you want to

1722
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:55,650
use fewer bits then and but give us at

1723
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:59,130
least I would say 7 to 128 combinations

1724
01:29:55,650 --> 01:30:00,719
it's probably good okay and because I

1725
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:04,350
don't think that we're I don't think

1726
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:07,440
that we want to have the the testing

1727
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:10,290
complexity of having to test devices in

1728
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:13,230
to to the number of bits possibilities

1729
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:15,420
of things we want to say well well there

1730
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:17,489
was two to the you know twelve bits

1731
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:19,320
possibilities only twelve of them

1732
01:30:17,489 --> 01:30:22,980
actually never makes sense in the field

1733
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:24,299
so we have twelve test cases not 2048 so

1734
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:26,910
I think that's an important point

1735
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,679
yes okay I can sorry I can buy that but

1736
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:31,889
then I would like to express it not as -

1737
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:34,050
but that's 2.5 meaning meaning the two

1738
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:35,429
is what's military and the dot five is

1739
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:37,500
what's up Shauna or something like that

1740
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:38,880
just I think my I was not very clear

1741
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:42,030
what I wanted to do with this discussion

1742
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,850
but what I really want to do is right

1743
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:47,969
now the map is all of nothing and I was

1744
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:49,950
thinking in the projection if I ever

1745
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:52,530
knowed that doesn't do projection what

1746
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:54,330
do I do with this guy can I can you join

1747
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:57,960
us leaf can is join us nothing can

1748
01:30:54,330 --> 01:31:01,200
Israel as router but not preferred you

1749
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:03,300
know so the dots Fife allows me to say

1750
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:06,090
hey I need to support the two the two

1751
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:08,010
operators at 2.5 if I can do the dot

1752
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:11,700
five I can still be a parent or

1753
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:15,110
something like I don't know I I feel

1754
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:18,179
that that needs more further discussion

1755
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:22,259
so I understand that I'm not going to go

1756
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:23,910
into it I I wonders if the DAO

1757
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:27,900
projection can be expressed as a

1758
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:29,519
capability i dot sure it can I always

1759
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:32,420
thought it had to be a mop I always

1760
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,950
thought that we maybe can make

1761
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:37,290
heterogeneous networks by somehow

1762
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:42,870
reporting ability to support dial

1763
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:44,280
projection in the doubt and I can't

1764
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:47,580
remember if we did that in the document

1765
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:48,960
now that's another interesting

1766
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:50,160
discussion because I wouldn't want if

1767
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,510
you don't mind if we have time to come

1768
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,309
back to the previous slide why it's

1769
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:55,800
actually about the eight one three

1770
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:59,190
eighteen compression also easy to

1771
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,900
capability or you know and it's not a

1772
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:04,349
matter of map of configuration options

1773
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:06,210
right I'm concerned that we take things

1774
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:08,010
where they belong which could be map and

1775
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:09,480
configuration option and try to put

1776
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:11,370
everything in capability well the

1777
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,940
capability is just I can do that it's

1778
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:16,559
not how it works right so so that may be

1779
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:19,200
the argument why this belongs in one

1780
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:22,530
document not to because maybe we

1781
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,540
document has some examples of why what

1782
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:26,880
what things are capabilities and what

1783
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:30,030
things require new mops and what are the

1784
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,620
Ayanna registry rules for for that maybe

1785
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:33,420
that's why it belongs in one document

1786
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:35,309
know what it means to do something in

1787
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:37,710
the configuration where in them up with

1788
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:38,940
our in the capabilities right so I don't

1789
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:41,310
have an answer for what you just said

1790
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:42,240
but I like it I like Raoul very much

1791
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:45,060
that you've introduced these

1792
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:50,820
capabilities it seems like that should

1793
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:52,010
be a bit field and I

1794
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:53,790
to remember something about the

1795
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:56,000
containerization of it whether or not we

1796
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:58,800
can extend the bit filled up arbitrarily

1797
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:02,240
by just making it longer but I can't

1798
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:05,070
remember both the container of that part

1799
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:07,190
but so that would be great and I think

1800
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:10,019
that we should adopt this and if and I

1801
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:12,389
further say if if this takes if the

1802
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:16,560
discussion takes the entire tyre T of

1803
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:16,980
the next IETF role session I'm okay with

1804
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,240
that

1805
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:20,099
because I think this is a really

1806
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,110
valuable thing to get past because and I

1807
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:25,050
don't and I think we actually need to

1808
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:26,969
delay maybe we want a virtual interim I

1809
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:29,610
think we need to delayed out projection

1810
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:31,800
until we figure this out because we

1811
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:33,450
can't publish that projection without

1812
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,510
having figured out how we figure out

1813
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:38,429
whether it's on or not okay I had the

1814
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:41,220
similar discussion very recently this is

1815
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:43,500
infrastructure work right how can you

1816
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:47,100
build a house if you don't have a solid

1817
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:48,870
infrastructure so we need to refine what

1818
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,180
those things are we need to define what

1819
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:53,490
goes where and explain it correctly and

1820
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:57,300
once we've got this infrastructure work

1821
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:59,639
in place now the turn-on and projection

1822
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:01,740
can all use it so I will work on

1823
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:03,360
projection don't worry but we cannot

1824
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:05,690
ship projection until this is shipped

1825
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:07,980
anyway so there is no point in erring

1826
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:10,679
100% on projection if we don't have this

1827
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:17,719
so I'm completely with Michael if we can

1828
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:17,720
have a mooring - whatever yeah 100%

1829
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:26,070
thank you very much Michael

1830
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:28,290
that's a comment I need to go back to

1831
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:37,710
the meetings and minutes of meetings and

1832
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:39,900
the video maybe yeah so royal don't go

1833
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:47,190
please if we have time I just have a

1834
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:49,650
question on your previous slide so here

1835
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:53,309
you seem to send a Dao from the route to

1836
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:55,920
a 6-0 and another Dao from the route to

1837
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:59,400
another 6-0 and I don't know how you

1838
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:02,850
plan to do that because the Jo is not

1839
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:04,808
unicast right it's spread and the route

1840
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:06,969
capabilities are

1841
01:35:04,809 --> 01:35:08,710
who warned that the wood sets and it's a

1842
01:35:06,969 --> 01:35:10,300
bit like the configuration it cannot be

1843
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:12,360
changed it will be the same for

1844
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:17,380
everybody you means the root capability

1845
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:20,199
if you want to turn on something that

1846
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:23,289
goes into the configuration option right

1847
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:26,289
and we have that's a configuration thing

1848
01:35:23,289 --> 01:35:28,630
it's not a capability its root can say

1849
01:35:26,289 --> 01:35:33,369
it's capable but then if it's capable is

1850
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:35,079
capable for everybody so I know I think

1851
01:35:33,369 --> 01:35:36,369
actually it's part of your draft to say

1852
01:35:35,079 --> 01:35:40,000
that this case would be a misuse of

1853
01:35:36,369 --> 01:35:43,570
capability and you can't have different

1854
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,190
route capability the capability is what

1855
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:47,789
I can do is not what I'm controlling on

1856
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:49,989
the others the root is controlling

1857
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:55,059
through the configuration option not

1858
01:35:49,989 --> 01:35:56,440
true the capability actually this is

1859
01:35:55,059 --> 01:35:59,050
exactly what we I don't think we should

1860
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:01,210
be doing right with this okay so I have

1861
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:03,579
them again there have been many points

1862
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:11,579
made here the multicast that the MIT

1863
01:36:03,579 --> 01:36:14,799
cast huh all right anything my view is

1864
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:17,230
capability and this is not it is the

1865
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,239
configurations my view but that's where

1866
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:22,089
your chart will be very very important

1867
01:36:19,239 --> 01:36:24,879
because it will it will contain our

1868
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:26,409
common agreement so one thing wrong but

1869
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,750
clearly now in the States out or

1870
01:36:26,409 --> 01:36:32,589
differentiate between the configuration

1871
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:34,119
option demo P and capability so this has

1872
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:35,770
to be clearly clearly specified in the

1873
01:36:34,119 --> 01:36:38,159
introduction section somewhere in the

1874
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:38,159
document

1875
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:55,560
okay thank you around now we are going

1876
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:59,700
to rise the working group adoption so

1877
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:09,870
who is agree with this government I want

1878
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:17,670
to be adopted hum please please ham for

1879
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:18,480
adoption for yes forgers yeah okay we

1880
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:25,220
need this works

1881
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:27,929
I mean is clearly obvious who is against

1882
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:30,690
okay and we are going to confirm with

1883
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:34,490
the middle east but thank you very much

1884
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:34,490
to the outdoors for bringing that up

1885
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:54,810
so next Haley he's going to present okay

1886
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:57,690
Lena from Cisco I introduced this after

1887
01:37:54,810 --> 01:38:02,880
about enabling eighty one thirty eight

1888
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:06,240
in brownfield and as you know eighty one

1889
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,450
thirty eight is used to compress up he

1890
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:14,040
people are the factors such as the API

1891
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:17,610
header and sorting handle and is fine in

1892
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:21,060
a new deployment but we find that there

1893
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:24,870
is a capability issue when we need to

1894
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:29,070
upgrade the network to support eighty

1895
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:31,530
one thirty eight you know the all the FC

1896
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:35,130
to support sorting sorting header and

1897
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:38,370
the RPI option is fired about eight

1898
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:42,600
years ago so we have deprived the

1899
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:46,200
millions of device which turned to

1900
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:48,780
support eighty one thirty eight and in

1901
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:53,460
81 so narrator in a thousand covered

1902
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:57,030
colic extent and and migration scenario

1903
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:59,309
so that's the requirement of the chapter

1904
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:05,309
we need to support it

1905
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:09,389
issue and the Incans can contrast search

1906
01:39:05,309 --> 01:39:13,219
after use of reporting for its assets

1907
01:39:09,389 --> 01:39:18,119
fighter three in to data configuration

1908
01:39:13,219 --> 01:39:23,250
which indicates it's used twenty three

1909
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:29,789
four up here header so there is no call

1910
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:32,670
extent case forty struct it works yeah

1911
01:39:29,789 --> 01:39:39,059
it works for this use of reporting for

1912
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:41,940
chapter and we add another flag T in the

1913
01:39:39,059 --> 01:39:44,820
to tell configure option please note

1914
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:49,579
it's a configuration of option it's not

1915
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:52,920
a capability and it can avoid Flag Day

1916
01:39:49,579 --> 01:39:58,250
which is a flag day it means in

1917
01:39:52,920 --> 01:40:02,520
currently deployment if we need to under

1918
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:05,429
upgrade the network from now eighty one

1919
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:09,150
thirty eight to eighty one thirty eight

1920
01:40:05,429 --> 01:40:09,869
we need to make sure or node in this

1921
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:15,299
network

1922
01:40:09,869 --> 01:40:18,598
I mean upgrade the firmware and we need

1923
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:21,030
to Newport Network you know that if we

1924
01:40:18,599 --> 01:40:23,400
need to be put network it will cause of

1925
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:27,539
lack day and the you know customer

1926
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:30,960
doesn't like these cases and if we use

1927
01:40:27,539 --> 01:40:36,050
this rafter we can avoid a flat day the

1928
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:40,079
new upgrade flow that is nodes can

1929
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:43,110
migrate to new code with flag off that

1930
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:46,009
means we can we can disable the t flag

1931
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:49,199
and they'll upgrade the firmware and

1932
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:52,590
after we Apple Apple creator or the

1933
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:57,750
firmware we can open the flag to enable

1934
01:40:52,590 --> 01:41:01,110
the eighty one thirty eight and you know

1935
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:04,050
if no that cannot support eighty one

1936
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:08,070
thirty eight they can stay as as leaves

1937
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:11,030
if they stay at leaves we there's no

1938
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:11,030
crab the issue

1939
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:18,110
okay this is the operation and know that

1940
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:21,770
that support destructor should sauce

1941
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:28,120
packets in the compress the form use 81

1942
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:31,420
38 when the t flag is set and another

1943
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:34,970
support this chapter should refrain from

1944
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:41,270
sorting packets in the compressor form

1945
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:48,770
with 81 38 with t flag reset this is the

1946
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:51,230
this is how to use the t flag and the

1947
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:55,010
regardless of the setting of the pit the

1948
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:56,719
loader master for the packet in the form

1949
01:41:55,010 --> 01:42:01,570
it is received

1950
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:01,570
whether it's compressed or uncompressed

1951
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:09,520
this is about transition the t flag in

1952
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:13,480
the to tell configuration option

1953
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:18,980
prevents flag days that might otherwise

1954
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:22,009
included trunk loss operators can

1955
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:25,280
refresh over the air and then restart

1956
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:29,180
the device sonorously keeping the

1957
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:33,590
network globally life I think this is

1958
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:37,090
the most important advantage for teens

1959
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:42,230
draft that is we can make the network

1960
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:45,460
keep life when we upgraded to support it

1961
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:48,459
once at the 8th and

1962
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:52,750
network can only be migrated to T's

1963
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:58,290
specification if all notes support 81 38

1964
01:42:52,750 --> 01:43:02,500
or the remaining node stay as the leaves

1965
01:42:58,290 --> 01:43:05,500
if we fail to observe that the drug may

1966
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:09,930
cause the remaining node received the

1967
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:12,700
compressed packet in 81 38 for more

1968
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:16,870
format they'll take him neither

1969
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:20,380
uncompressed nor for what so we need to

1970
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:26,290
make sure the node that had done to

1971
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:30,520
support 81 38 stay as leaves and we have

1972
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:33,310
some method to keep them as leaves we

1973
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:36,280
can use a new map or we can use a new

1974
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:42,010
object function that can keep the

1975
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:46,150
latency nodes to stay as leaves if all

1976
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:51,210
possible roads are not compatible of 81

1977
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:55,710
38 the zone maybe is loaded and we

1978
01:43:51,210 --> 01:43:59,500
propose two scenarios to enforce leaf

1979
01:43:55,710 --> 01:44:02,560
enforce the node as leaves we can use

1980
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:06,040
single instance or doubling instance the

1981
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:10,570
single instance means we should keep the

1982
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:13,600
flag off and we use the new board or new

1983
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:17,259
object function to upgrade all the

1984
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:22,590
network and after we are up with the

1985
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:25,750
upgraded we should enable the T flag and

1986
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:29,770
let legends in know the two P dips and

1987
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:34,420
the double instance this is the same as

1988
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:39,520
the ship in night case in 6 5 5 0 which

1989
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:44,469
we can find it the last one is we need

1990
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:48,880
to encapsulate the parent that means if

1991
01:44:44,469 --> 01:44:50,890
some know the stay as leaves it means

1992
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,530
it's a doesn't support anyone's at the 8

1993
01:44:50,890 --> 01:44:56,710
so it'll stay at leaves say in this case

1994
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:58,880
if we want to send a packet to this leaf

1995
01:44:56,710 --> 01:45:02,960
node we need to in

1996
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:05,960
have you later the packet who is parent

1997
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:08,750
the impaired endure came decompressed

1998
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:12,020
packet and forward to the leaf nodes

1999
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:16,850
this is just the same as our way our

2000
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:21,980
leaf and we need to we still need some

2001
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:32,389
work to four fields inside okay that's

2002
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:35,530
all sets or forties draft Michael

2003
01:45:32,389 --> 01:45:38,719
Richardson I don't think we want to I

2004
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:41,210
agree with what you're doing it's good I

2005
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:43,219
don't think that amok would help because

2006
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:46,159
we would have to double the number of

2007
01:45:43,219 --> 01:45:47,960
mops because we'd have to have one for

2008
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:50,388
on and off for each one of them so I

2009
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:54,710
don't think we ever would a mop would

2010
01:45:50,389 --> 01:45:56,810
ever use I don't know the venom Oh F

2011
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:58,760
would work but maybe it would if a

2012
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:02,179
capability will work then we should try

2013
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:05,210
that because I think this is a a shove

2014
01:46:02,179 --> 01:46:07,610
whether the capability is useful that

2015
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:09,139
would be my preference maybe that takes

2016
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:13,880
too long in the working group but I'm

2017
01:46:09,139 --> 01:46:15,469
not sure and so I just don't know if it

2018
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:21,949
works or not and I think maybe Pascal's

2019
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:23,960
gonna stay there the the the the whole

2020
01:46:21,949 --> 01:46:25,428
business about encapsulating things to

2021
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:31,850
the parent so that the parent can

2022
01:46:25,429 --> 01:46:37,070
decompress them and send them along yeah

2023
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:39,320
remove the tunnel I'm just I'm not a I'm

2024
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:43,519
not actually sure that's necessary to

2025
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:46,219
encapsulate to do that because we are

2026
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:49,330
just compressing ipv6 so at each node

2027
01:46:46,219 --> 01:46:53,030
logically we are uncompressing ipv6 and

2028
01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:57,170
so it's okay to Incred and compress and

2029
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:59,540
decompress differently right so I don't

2030
01:46:57,170 --> 01:47:01,159
know that we need to do that there which

2031
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:04,790
makes things a lot easier they still

2032
01:47:01,159 --> 01:47:06,920
have to be leaves because they can't

2033
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:08,480
understand other things but the critical

2034
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:11,380
part is their parent has to know that

2035
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:11,379
there they are

2036
01:47:11,449 --> 01:47:15,919
incapable they could actually operate as

2037
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:18,259
routers if all of the nodes were willing

2038
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:20,120
to do that to keep track of parents and

2039
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:23,110
children to keep track of what they can

2040
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:26,090
do but I grew it agree that that is an

2041
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:27,290
uninteresting from a you know upgrading

2042
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:28,460
point of view you're selling the middle

2043
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:30,469
the network the packets get bigger

2044
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:35,600
because we didn't compress them as well

2045
01:47:30,469 --> 01:47:38,090
that seems dumb right and for the first

2046
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:41,989
question I think that a new object

2047
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:43,850
function can can tell a section in sixty

2048
01:47:41,989 --> 01:47:47,030
five five zero which identifier we can

2049
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:49,670
use a new object function the means if

2050
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:53,179
the node cannot recognize the object

2051
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:55,670
function it should to stay as a leaf yes

2052
01:47:53,179 --> 01:47:57,199
so we can suppose to use that one works

2053
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:59,360
I'm not saying it's a good idea but I

2054
01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:01,460
agree with me it works because the new

2055
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:03,469
nodes which become configured with the

2056
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:05,679
new wealthier ones will just ignore it

2057
01:48:03,469 --> 01:48:09,110
yeah and so we would build that

2058
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:11,060
Earthship in night so so it would work

2059
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:13,880
another thing it's durable was just

2060
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:15,469
proposed all the options and I tend to

2061
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,969
disagree it's a capability again we have

2062
01:48:15,469 --> 01:48:18,500
to define what we mean by the world

2063
01:48:16,969 --> 01:48:22,160
capabilities and what we want to place

2064
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:24,620
in that options I think it's really just

2065
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:26,510
like use of ripple info it's the same

2066
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:27,980
thing and because the same thing it's

2067
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:30,500
much more logical to use the same means

2068
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:33,620
you use b3 we want to use b2 right it's

2069
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:35,929
Semco same effect we are very logical we

2070
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:37,300
have the same approach to everything so

2071
01:48:35,929 --> 01:48:38,989
that's why we started with this bit

2072
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:40,790
regardless of the progress of

2073
01:48:38,989 --> 01:48:44,480
capabilities because I want to progress

2074
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:46,489
capabilities anyway more like mo of

2075
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,218
interest is like if we want to avoid the

2076
01:48:46,489 --> 01:48:51,230
primer from caps or anything why would

2077
01:48:49,219 --> 01:48:54,739
this node which does not support the

2078
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:57,349
feature just join us unaware leaf right

2079
01:48:54,739 --> 01:48:59,030
we could say a if you join us leaf now

2080
01:48:57,350 --> 01:49:00,679
we have the support for unaware why do

2081
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:04,550
you need to be aware what does it bring

2082
01:49:00,679 --> 01:49:06,710
to you all right because we're facing an

2083
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:08,570
early guess node which does not

2084
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:10,280
understand the new mode of operation

2085
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:12,980
which does not understand what ripple is

2086
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,690
doing and so we told initially in repo

2087
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:17,540
everybody had to be a leaf so we said eh

2088
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:19,099
you have to be a colleague but now we've

2089
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:21,679
got this new thing which is the ripple

2090
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:22,910
unaware leaf and because since you know

2091
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:25,219
you don't understand what's going on

2092
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:27,290
this ripple Network why try

2093
01:49:25,219 --> 01:49:29,060
why don't you just join us anywhere

2094
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:30,650
Ethan that's it and that solved our caps

2095
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:48,080
problem because I know what if already

2096
01:49:30,650 --> 01:49:53,750
already as the process for it thank you

2097
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:56,930
very much yeah we need reviews who is

2098
01:49:53,750 --> 01:50:07,310
willing to review this document please

2099
01:49:56,930 --> 01:50:08,989
price him so two things on this draft

2100
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:11,540
it's it's like a two pager right it's

2101
01:50:08,989 --> 01:50:14,000
it's actually my fault because when when

2102
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:15,860
I read your rewrite reviews of reporting

2103
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,330
for itself I realized hey I forgot to do

2104
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,519
that with eight one three eight it's my

2105
01:50:17,330 --> 01:50:20,870
fault and because because I forgot to do

2106
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:24,969
that now we've got to work on all those

2107
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:27,620
transition scenarios in all things right

2108
01:50:24,969 --> 01:50:30,110
but it also means it's a very simple

2109
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:34,640
draft like it's one bit in one

2110
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:36,290
configuration option so we already need

2111
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:39,110
it in the field we would like to deploy

2112
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:41,060
it once created weekend so the more we

2113
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:43,549
delayed this work the longer it's going

2114
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:45,680
to take to deploy it once right so all

2115
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:48,410
we're asking is just a bit which is very

2116
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:51,110
very similar in a sense as the one we

2117
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:53,300
just ship in use of report info so I

2118
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:54,830
don't think it would should take two

2119
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:58,310
years for this group to do the work

2120
01:50:54,830 --> 01:51:01,070
through that bit I mean we have a

2121
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:03,320
longest three at the HF of making FCS in

2122
01:51:01,070 --> 01:51:05,330
four to ten years I would like this one

2123
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:10,670
to prove that we can do something in six

2124
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:13,610
months it's one date which starts with

2125
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:15,890
quick adaption yeah per se who is

2126
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:30,089
willing to review please who have Thank

2127
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:32,940
You Micah who ends activation of

2128
01:51:30,090 --> 01:51:34,650
my personal opinion cut off is that

2129
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:37,710
convinced not well understood at this

2130
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:39,509
moment so for me personally I'm not

2131
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:41,850
clear if this is a special salute

2132
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:43,530
special solution to such a problem or

2133
01:51:41,850 --> 01:51:45,120
that we should have in general solution

2134
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:48,360
which we can apply it more often and

2135
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:50,580
just use in general decision algorithm

2136
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,540
which can be adapted for these kinds of

2137
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:54,360
things actually

2138
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:57,030
it's replicating the solution that we

2139
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:58,740
used for use of ripple information so

2140
01:51:57,030 --> 01:52:01,349
it's just replicating it and we hope

2141
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:04,260
that we can replicate again so it's not

2142
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:06,150
a first it's actually a second it's just

2143
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:07,710
because I did not do in this draft art

2144
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:10,019
we didn't use of ripple info which is

2145
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:11,940
provided a way to do the brown field I

2146
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:14,400
just wrote it in a green field without

2147
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:16,440
thinking of Brahms field use of ripple

2148
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,570
info thought about brown field at the

2149
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:24,480
bit so now I'm adding the bit as the

2150
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:25,980
second start means dump the most complex

2151
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,719
is actually that we have to write all

2152
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:29,820
those words about possible transitions

2153
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:32,040
right but the actual thing we

2154
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:35,400
standardized Israel at Oak Valley so

2155
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:38,310
particle you brown it it's only request

2156
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:40,769
one bit is required like isn't it

2157
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:43,920
required that all the other nodes the

2158
01:52:40,770 --> 01:52:48,920
nodes also mentioned or also indicate

2159
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:51,840
that they already support six lower edge

2160
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:54,030
so it's not only about one bit right I

2161
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:55,890
mean the nodes also need to indicate to

2162
01:52:54,030 --> 01:53:05,099
the route that they'd supports the

2163
01:52:55,890 --> 01:53:08,280
cleric there is nice to have which we

2164
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:11,550
don't have in news of ripple info and I

2165
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:13,679
would like you to add in actually to

2166
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:16,500
just as a starter for the capabilities

2167
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:18,540
draft I told you there are two bits

2168
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:20,910
really it is true for use of ribbon for

2169
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:23,220
it's true for this one is one bit which

2170
01:53:20,910 --> 01:53:29,490
is I can do it and the other bit which

2171
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:31,530
is I started it it's running we can live

2172
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:36,080
without that use of repairing lives

2173
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:40,110
without that expects that a guy who

2174
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:42,690
deploys knows what is in his network and

2175
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:44,839
what software he has in his nodes and

2176
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:47,940
guess what usually they

2177
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:50,100
so it's just for a better automation or

2178
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:51,870
something like that that you would like

2179
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:55,199
to know whether it has actually be

2180
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:57,390
turned on but the weights written if

2181
01:53:55,199 --> 01:54:00,120
some notes if all notes support it and

2182
01:53:57,390 --> 01:54:02,310
some notes turn it on its gonna work

2183
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:03,840
it's not like you need everybody to

2184
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:05,300
learn done because you have to for the

2185
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:09,929
packets the way they are written right

2186
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:11,550
so if the administrator knows the

2187
01:54:09,929 --> 01:54:14,100
current level of software of his notes

2188
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:16,440
and you knows that they are all now

2189
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:19,440
graded and use this bit to turn it down

2190
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:21,059
it's gonna work for meat enough to ship

2191
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:25,199
this draft was enough to ship use of

2192
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:27,810
ripple info now I would love to for this

2193
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:30,089
draft and for use of ripple info to have

2194
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:32,600
the capabilities by the node I can

2195
01:54:30,090 --> 01:54:35,820
support it as I've switched it up

2196
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:37,830
whether it goes in this bag fine yours

2197
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:42,120
back I don't mind they will ship

2198
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:43,739
together so I would say it's good to

2199
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:45,929
have good examples in your spec so it

2200
01:54:43,739 --> 01:54:49,400
could goes in your spec for a for use of

2201
01:54:45,929 --> 01:54:51,929
ripple info it has to go in your spec

2202
01:54:49,400 --> 01:55:00,299
because use of employ it's already

2203
01:54:51,929 --> 01:55:02,100
shipped I proposed you to discuss the

2204
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:05,340
adoption on the on the mailing list

2205
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:09,710
please see more poeple see more opinions

2206
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:09,710
and more alternatives maybe for

2207
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:30,030
additional comments okay then the last

2208
01:55:27,949 --> 01:55:35,129
last five minutes

2209
01:55:30,030 --> 01:55:39,750
the has been and and design team working

2210
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:41,699
on the beer ripple work it has convened

2211
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:43,140
a few times there's focus has been made

2212
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:48,000
has been made Understanding between

2213
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:50,520
especially Pascale and Kirsten but the

2214
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,460
last three months we have not seen too

2215
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:55,530
much focus and have been people have

2216
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:57,570
other occupations so it is at this

2217
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:59,730
moment it is not really

2218
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:02,369
to go further further forward with this

2219
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:05,750
design team and what we wanted to do is

2220
01:56:02,369 --> 01:56:08,880
that we consider that there is this

2221
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:12,060
draft which is done a failure on the

2222
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:14,130
very limited scope of using beer within

2223
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:16,679
the hole which has been proposed and we

2224
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:19,199
wanted to continue this draft and this

2225
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:20,760
the very way that Bosco can look at it

2226
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:23,098
see that it will fit in the grander

2227
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:25,190
scheme that he has in mind and then go

2228
01:56:23,099 --> 01:56:27,179
forward like that and we will leave

2229
01:56:25,190 --> 01:56:29,280
abandoned and for the moment this

2230
01:56:27,179 --> 01:56:31,679
concept of the design team and we'll

2231
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:33,329
just wait for traps to be proposed and

2232
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:36,210
then forward them to the working group

2233
01:56:33,329 --> 01:56:38,269
that's the idea anybody any comments on

2234
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:38,270
that

2235
01:56:39,230 --> 01:56:46,559
no great then I still have three minutes

2236
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,599
maybe this will not be solved in three

2237
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:54,360
minutes but I'm happy to have our ad

2238
01:56:48,599 --> 01:56:56,040
present we should be recharter I mean

2239
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:58,889
that's almost the promises we made at

2240
01:56:56,040 --> 01:57:01,290
the end of this year of other stop well

2241
01:56:58,889 --> 01:57:03,060
now I've seen that there's a certain set

2242
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:05,670
of new documents are going forward in

2243
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:09,030
this in this group we have also an

2244
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:11,280
outgoing documents going for which so

2245
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:13,349
which means that other healthy group at

2246
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:15,360
this moment maybe you don't see the

2247
01:57:13,349 --> 01:57:18,810
number of but we all use work and have

2248
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:21,389
very good results so I don't think that

2249
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:23,040
we need to change the Charter and that

2250
01:57:21,389 --> 01:57:35,869
without changing the church are we just

2251
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:37,440
continue is that possible a lot already

2252
01:57:35,869 --> 01:57:41,040
anything is possible

2253
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:48,150
great but however villains work

2254
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:51,420
so I've liked very much how you guys

2255
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:54,719
have managed the working group in the

2256
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:58,310
you periodically recharter to add things

2257
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:00,480
in scope and go from there now I

2258
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:03,060
honestly didn't read the Charter in the

2259
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:05,098
last seconds so I remember exactly all

2260
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:07,500
the details of the Charter but the last

2261
01:58:05,099 --> 01:58:09,519
few times that we have recharter it has

2262
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:13,269
been to include specific work items

2263
01:58:09,519 --> 01:58:15,489
so I have been happy with that I'm sure

2264
01:58:13,269 --> 01:58:17,800
that the Charter says something around

2265
01:58:15,489 --> 01:58:20,259
work on Ripple and you know something

2266
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:24,760
that so in theory there are other things

2267
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:29,409
that are in the Charter right the risk

2268
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:32,440
of putting specific work items is that

2269
01:58:29,409 --> 01:58:36,129
the assumption is that others are not

2270
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:39,030
let's go right so you know for one point

2271
01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:41,710
of view I want to I guess my answer to

2272
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:44,139
read the Charter and think of it about a

2273
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:49,449
little bit you know we could you create

2274
01:58:44,139 --> 01:58:51,039
a charter that is more general not

2275
01:58:49,449 --> 01:58:52,329
necessarily to the point of we'll do

2276
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:56,199
anything we want with Ripple

2277
01:58:52,329 --> 01:58:58,058
but yeah to you know talk about general

2278
01:58:56,199 --> 01:59:02,049
things that we might want to work and

2279
01:58:58,059 --> 01:59:04,420
then we could we meaning you can manage

2280
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:06,280
the working group using the milestones

2281
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:07,900
all right with agreement for the working

2282
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:10,059
group of what are the I don't know two

2283
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:11,230
things three things whatever that you're

2284
01:59:10,059 --> 01:59:12,550
gonna work over the next year for

2285
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:13,718
example then you can put in the

2286
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:15,969
milestones of Management that way

2287
01:59:13,719 --> 01:59:19,210
instead of having to reach Artur every

2288
01:59:15,969 --> 01:59:20,440
other year trust that you know I think

2289
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:23,019
you guys have done a really good job in

2290
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:24,909
keeping the focus on the working group

2291
01:59:23,019 --> 01:59:26,860
that doesn't necessary have to be done

2292
01:59:24,909 --> 01:59:29,558
by the Charter and I think they're

2293
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:33,098
working group being a relatively small

2294
01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:35,889
community is really good in not just

2295
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:38,590
diverging and bringing all kinds of of

2296
01:59:35,889 --> 01:59:41,019
other proposals so so yeah I would be

2297
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:42,639
opening with that ping me maybe later we

2298
01:59:41,019 --> 01:59:44,739
can talk about you know specific sort of

2299
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:46,900
Charter and we can go from there and a

2300
01:59:44,739 --> 01:59:50,379
half the actual I can actually really

2301
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:52,119
answer those the church have also really

2302
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:53,949
formulated in general terms there's a

2303
01:59:52,119 --> 01:59:56,558
few examples of work that you wanted to

2304
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:58,268
do key my reformulate those may

2305
01:59:56,559 --> 02:00:00,730
emphasize actually additional things

2306
01:59:58,269 --> 02:00:02,349
what you want to do and then cite some

2307
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:04,598
of the examples which have been done and

2308
02:00:02,349 --> 02:00:08,800
examples we want to be do and then

2309
02:00:04,599 --> 02:00:10,539
possibly continue like that maybe I

2310
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:14,219
would have to see specifics of what that

2311
02:00:10,539 --> 02:00:14,219
looks like okay good yes

2312
02:00:17,749 --> 02:00:25,909
okay thank you very much everyone we are

2313

2314
02:00:25,909 --> 02:00:32,030
the tickets for the open issues that we

2315
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:34,639
discussed yes yes we are going to play

2316
