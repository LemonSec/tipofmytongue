37
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:48,460
six six seven people on the Java right

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:50,920
and the link to the working group is you

39
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,530
know on the posted here and the next is

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,480
the agenda it's on the site as well and

41
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,650
a couple of things I think a quick

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,500
review of where we are we the first

43
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,720
document that these are the working

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,320
group documents a quick status update on

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,540
where we are first one is the user plane

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,040
protocol and architecture analysis on

47
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:20,549
3gpp Phi J system alright this is Phi GU

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,140
plane analysis it's a 0 2 version I

49
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,450
think I've seen some discussions in the

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,100
Mahler and I think it's progressing it's

51
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,589
still in the early stages right

52
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,989
but overall authors are serious and

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,860
there's a good amount of you know work

54
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,959
is happening right I think yeah working

55
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,160
on participation we need reviews but I

56
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,670
think it's okay so far

57
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,420
the reviews are okay on this the next

58
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:50,440
document is segment routing ipv6 for sr

59
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,600
v6 for mobile user plain this is the SR

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,290
v6 mobile use a plain 0 5 version of the

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:00,820
document this is almost you know coming

62
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:03,010
to closure right I think you know we

63
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,230
have for both these documents you know

64
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,780
there's a scheduled in a presentation

65
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:11,738
slot you're going to hear more you know

66
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:14,739
more on these documents now moving on to

67
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,850
the FPC document earlier FPC document

68
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:20,160
was one but last time

69
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,290
there was a view that the FPC document

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,060
should be split into that the yang model

71
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,830
should be because many people felt this

72
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,690
is a you know document in the size of

73
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,659
two hundred pages is unreadable right

74
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,610
that is the feedback even I tried to

75
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,770
reach out for some you know reviewers to

76
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,080
you know review this but the size of the

77
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,780
mere size of the document we got you

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,310
know it's not going anywhere so we chose

79
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,539
after our discussions with ad and we you

80
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,700
know yes Suresh yeah so question so like

81
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,220
this is kind of like a I kind of pushed

82
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,200
on this a little bit because I think the

83
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,180
potential review pool for these two are

84
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,909
different and I think somebody can look

85
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,740
at the document like with like a move

86
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,480
mobility perspective and then like sign

87
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,820
off on it and then we can see if the

88
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,440
yang model matches this in what we can

89
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,020
put that in the groove if somebody can

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,570
look for the yang best practices

91
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,250
separately and and like you know I was

92
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,159
trying to get a review from the CT chair

93
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,800
which is Leonel so he's like you know

94
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
it's just too big for somebody who read

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,880
this thing right and I don't think

96
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,160
everybody has to read the yang module

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,750
right like that slide has to do the

98
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,060
review separately see if the yang is

99
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,000
well formed in one day and well-designed

100
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,040
and all we have to do is check if what

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,480
we want to do is good and if the yang

102
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,210
model matches so that's like three

103
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,650
different things we can do independently

104
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,890
that's right and of why I was trying to

105
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,080
push for this okay yeah that make sense

106
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,640
thank you I think yeah and for the

107
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,190
minutes like one of the things we

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,440
decided was that the yang module will

109
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,390
become a document with no further calls

110
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,410
so that's something I signed off on so

111
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,240
that's just like yeah absolutely I think

112
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,340
based on our discussions last time it

113
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,000
already it that process that step

114
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,650
already took place yeah so yeah so

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,690
essentially that the FPC document now

116
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,270
got split into two documents one is the

117
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,210
the base specification and the young

118
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,299
yang pod is separate which is the yang

119
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,859
for protocol for FPC now that the

120
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,930
document size are somewhat manageable

121
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,490
and you know each with a different focus

122
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,720
or it's somebody with some you know

123
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,760
understanding familiar with the yang

124
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,710
structure semantics they'll be able to

125
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,599
review the yang thing with more you know

126
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,880
from the point of view of the semantics

127
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
and all of that so

128
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,600
is it this is a good move in our opinion

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,270
so now hopefully we should be to move

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,540
them forward right the FPC unfortunately

131
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,700
the FPC document in the process you know

132
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,200
has to be republish because it also has

133
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,820
the yang stuff that needs to be you know

134
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,930
I think now we are waiting for Charlie

135
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:52,430
to North us to no posting new version so

136
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:56,090
so this is the these are the documents

137
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,920
now the other three other documents

138
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,169
which are completed working a blast call

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,080
on is the the distributed mobility

140
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,360
anchoring and the proximal abusive

141
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,580
extensions for DMM both are you know we

142
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,060
have completed the we have sent it to

143
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:15,409
Suri if they or ad it's in a TQ yeah

144
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:18,770
Suresh yeah so I was hoping to get this

145
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,300
done before the idea but we just came in

146
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,270
it just a bit too late for me to review

147
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,190
it so I hope to get this both of them

148
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,750
out of my queue probably in within the

149
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,090
next two weeks at least

150
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,680
ad evil out okay and hopefully there's

151
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,460
not much to fix but once it's done I'll

152
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,990
set up E

153
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,060
so I'm not gonna wait for an interview

154
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,640
on this because I think like I can take

155
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,760
care of this lecture of myself so it

156
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,950
eval many changes is required and then

157
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,200
it goes to ITF last call sure and be on

158
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,030
demand mobility it's just by waiting

159
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,370
some discuss resolution so I managed to

160
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,469
have some discussions on that there's

161
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,780
probably something to do but it's not

162
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,190
clear what it is so I do like sit down

163
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,219
with like Danny

164
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,480
hopefully probably like discuss like you

165
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,950
know some ways to address things but

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,400
it's I probably won't be able to do it

167
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,200
till Friday okay so III don't want to

168
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,780
get this document on because it's almost

169
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,700
done so it's like very close to being

170
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,200
finished so I will try to get this out

171
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,820
very quickly well I don't think it's

172
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,370
like too much working group action

173
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,710
required on this because I think the

174
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,900
changes are going to be pretty minor

175
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,870
kind of so it's just 1 discus pending as

176
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:36,319
far as I know is it I think it's to to

177
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:40,010
discuss donations okay just make sure

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,140
not Friday if like whatever is required

179
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,319
is done so before you go home I can tell

180
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,280
you

181
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:54,260
like if there's any steps for you thanks

182
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:58,130
Suresh so yeah so that is the status of

183
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:03,200
all the working group documents next is

184
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:11,120
our first presentation right just let's

185
00:09:03,200 --> 00:10:20,800
make sure yeah this is the SR v6 mobile

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:10:46,570
user plain cetera sonication this one

187
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:46,569
again sorry and this one

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:11:12,940
fullscreen working for school good

189
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,100
morning everyone

190
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,450
on Saturday measurement I'm going to

191
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,660
present as a bisque my buddies are

192
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,660
playing update for fifth

193
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:03,550
okay okay here's summary of the update

194
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:07,690
from fourth version to fifth version the

195
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,650
naming the change the the commented on

196
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:14,860
the mailing list

197
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:18,100
I took the naming for the the

198
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:22,660
transformation function from ipv4 gtp to

199
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:25,540
SR basics from TM team up to TM gtp 40

200
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:29,829
it is not clear what the function looks

201
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,150
like and next one is to reflect the

202
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,010
comment on the Marianist

203
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:39,280
which the ue session is unclear so i we

204
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:42,670
also to take the the terminology of PDU

205
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,939
system instead so name is change as done

206
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:50,189
so next seeds status mapping rule have

207
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:53,980
been changed to reflect the new format

208
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,050
to adopt a new argument to put the

209
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,300
mobile session mobile mobility session

210
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,949
information in the sit

211
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:07,599
so I'm in detail the fit format of the

212
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:11,170
ad GT and MGT p6 and for e in the

213
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,490
direction of the SL basic to GT GT you

214
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:19,540
to align the format of the odd mob

215
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:22,060
session that's one the next one is the

216
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,360
last seat in the outgoing packet of the

217
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,089
end

218
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:32,880
MDT p6 d in the direction of the HTTP

219
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:37,090
GTP to SL v6 in ipv6 case and GTP full

220
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:42,490
case also aligned with the the arguments

221
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:48,220
format the pseudocode of the end MGT p

222
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:51,490
6d and GTP 4d is updated to make sure

223
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:56,200
the PD session type for the especially

224
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,510
before basic system the original XY is

225
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,680
original IP v4 sauce others it is

226
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:05,620
preserved in the ipv6 source others in

227
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,310
the the previous version the source of

228
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,940
this is embedded on the asset but this

229
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:17,050
update makes the sources to be in the

230
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:21,270
source address of the ipv6 packet that's

231
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,270
summary of the update in this version

232
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:37,210
yeah thank you so as you may know we did

233
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,229
some project to implement this some of

234
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:45,510
the future almost of the future of the

235
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:50,740
service-mobile is a frame by using the

236
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:53,380
PPP fido project now or gtp interworking

237
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,250
function has been implemented by using

238
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:01,780
this so the implementation aligned

239
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:05,800
already the new mapping rule so the new

240
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:11,350
old interval function means that g p6 e

241
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:15,040
and d and g TP for on e and e TP for 2d

242
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:19,450
so during the hackathon we figure out

243
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,300
that we need one more function to

244
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,690
support drop-in mode so the drop-in mole

245
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,089
it's not described this document but let

246
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,580
me explain a little bit idea is the cut

247
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,010
pocket comes into the GDP node gtp node

248
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,790
and capital pocket by a GTP hitter then

249
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:39,430
a service node transferred gtp packet

250
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,520
tracer basics this is the normal case

251
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:46,630
but in drop-in mode that's the it's a

252
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,939
basic packet transits again to the gtp

253
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:53,410
you that's introduced a service user

254
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:57,610
friend with no impact to the Assad gtp

255
00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:01,030
the past end-to-end so in the part in

256
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:06,010
the middle of path it's a v6 they use

257
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:09,730
the plane can be manipulated by the the

258
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:13,450
function or T pass by the the operators

259
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:17,500
Porsche so that's the the wonderful

260
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:22,750
things we achieved to implement a figure

261
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:25,360
out so um the whole running code

262
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:29,140
available already in the github repo

263
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,790
please see the the code and play with

264
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:37,449
that and your fieldwork is really highly

265
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,160
appreciated just a question status on

266
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,260
like so the the drop in scenarios like

267
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,480
what is the use case is it for like

268
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,930
roaming or like for hierarchical stuff

269
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,800
like what are you thinking of one of the

270
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:53,949
use case is to put some function it's

271
00:16:50,800 --> 00:17:00,930
not the the CVP Network function it to

272
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:00,930
be kind of the arbiter of function Riker

273
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:07,990
so called

274
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:12,060
like the function deploying so far it's

275
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:15,849
in six interface beyond that but once

276
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:20,760
the packet translates to SRB six all of

277
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:23,290
the function deploy so far in the m6 is

278
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,368
located on the in the middle of the path

279
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,158
of

280
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:31,610
the mobility path that we 1yd another is

281
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:38,710
of course the traffic engine it's easy

282
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:40,939
to see and make sure the routing

283
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:45,710
differentiation based on the seat

284
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:49,039
instead of the the end point of a gtp

285
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:56,980
you which does no information to follow

286
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:56,980
the South's rising or qa5 or something

287
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,669
like I understand why it's getting

288
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:03,199
converted but I'm just worried about why

289
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:05,179
are it because the insects you can just

290
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,710
pump out the IP packet right right right

291
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,090
next I'm just wondering like you know

292
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,499
what is a user so the two things I

293
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,470
thought of was like either you're having

294
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:14,480
a hierarchical UPF right because like

295
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,279
the other one might be true GT will UPF

296
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,809
right and the second almost roaming

297
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,570
those are the two things I was thinking

298
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:22,730
of is is that like similar to what it

299
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,029
yes yes okay and the second question is

300
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,489
are you gonna add this into the draft

301
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:31,929
the next question I think it's

302
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:39,139
reasonable personally no idea okay

303
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:42,919
okay so on please so I hope to clarify

304
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:45,350
the major and minor including minor

305
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:49,309
Chris comment from the mailing list so

306
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:53,199
to make sure the all of the the comment

307
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:58,100
would be appropriately reflected to the

308
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:01,519
draft so in the in the end of the this

309
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:07,070
work I would like to ask the the working

310
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:09,950
group last call so let's see the major

311
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:14,149
comment so first one is the dropping

312
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:16,159
mode as we talk so what we received from

313
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:20,268
the mailing list it could we'd add the

314
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:22,460
top in mode I mean gtp - it's a basic to

315
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:27,590
gtp Act translational game which I'll

316
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:30,350
admit has presented the idea of 103 so I

317
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,928
think we have we can have discussed

318
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,408
shown like the dropping mode almost

319
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:37,860
covered by the existing function except

320
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:41,400
the one

321
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:45,610
Gigi tp6 thought did the eye because the

322
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:50,470
GT p 6d doesn't put the endpoint of the

323
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:54,520
gtp you but back the gtp header from the

324
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:57,310
deepest abyss to gtp so in for the GT p6

325
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,590
case we need the original and the point

326
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,440
others of gtp use so that others should

327
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,439
be preserved at the ends and the last

328
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,360
sheet in the SR header so that's why we

329
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,990
need to define the new function to cover

330
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:16,659
this drop in mode another point it's

331
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:19,210
whether we preserve the UDP source port

332
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:22,330
that's original to make sure the

333
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:26,740
transparency of the original gtp

334
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:30,280
parkette I don't think we need to

335
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:34,900
preserve original UDP source port

336
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:38,440
because he gtp U is one of the

337
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:42,520
unidirectional atonium protocol it's not

338
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:46,300
needed to to define the tunneling

339
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:49,750
session by using source port but it

340
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:53,399
makes sure that some stray bit of the

341
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:59,200
road balancing by using source port

342
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:01,750
entropy but it it not be requirement to

343
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,180
keep the original source port

344
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:09,490
transparently we can calculate the hash

345
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:13,510
to put this or UDP sources so that's the

346
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:16,720
two discussion here so question here to

347
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,350
you is that this draft need to describe

348
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:26,530
the open mode or to be better so I think

349
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:30,189
if certain number of people think

350
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:34,600
dropping mode is it's useful visible i I

351
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:38,410
was happy to work on that and also if

352
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:43,060
someone doesn't understand doesn't find

353
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:46,570
the any goodness to cover the drop-in

354
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:51,428
mode I think we can keep the raft as it

355
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:55,809
is so please comment on that

356
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:59,229
now or after the presentation okay I

357
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:01,210
think myself are the Shree chair hat off

358
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:07,960
I think it makes sense to describe it

359
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:09,179
okay good okay let's take that and next

360
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,719
one please

361
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:17,109
x-rays please so next one is the the

362
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:19,149
argument our mobile session so the

363
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:21,849
comment is when it is required to use

364
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:24,849
augmentation when would be a sit need

365
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:28,779
this information what is B so discussion

366
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:31,479
here is unchanged in LB scenario should

367
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:35,080
be a case at least the augmentation to

368
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:37,719
the use because the entry into NSR

369
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,449
basics user plan case are not necessary

370
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:42,639
to use the augment system if the seat

371
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:46,149
count indicates a quest for an session

372
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:48,389
but in case that once it agree a once it

373
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:50,859
aggregates the multiple PDS system

374
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:54,099
augment system also help to avoid

375
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:57,369
barrage of acid former that's discussion

376
00:22:54,099 --> 00:23:00,178
so here we propose the resolution its

377
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:02,949
add text to clarify the argument

378
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,960
augmentation is required in case that

379
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:12,909
one said I agree it much PPD session

380
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:15,399
that's why prop order please next so

381
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:18,879
Nick so next slide also the augmentation

382
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:21,248
so the comment from menus it's please

383
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:23,139
elaborate dissipate more since this

384
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:25,929
function is likely not to be

385
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:28,508
instantiated party this session argument

386
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:31,059
session helps the UPF to perform the

387
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:34,979
function which require public QP q fi

388
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:38,320
and o video session granularity so this

389
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:40,809
discussion it's worth it I would get

390
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,570
multiple video session down to the same

391
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:46,509
policy argument session help to indicate

392
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:49,119
which PD session packet will apply that

393
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:52,989
course such a usage they bought a us at

394
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:56,199
rest etc so proposal suggests illusion

395
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:58,330
here is the add some text like in case

396
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,029
that once it aggregate multiple video

397
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,918
system to the above sentence above

398
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:04,419
sentence means

399
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,080
since the is a dysfunction they're

400
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,860
actually not

401
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,810
to be instantiate blah blah blah so this

402
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,929
is sad point

403
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:18,730
so next please let's repeat the next

404
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:21,490
point is it's our policy in the section

405
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:24,940
5 dos 3.1 interworking with ESL basics

406
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:28,060
gtp the comment is how does the assault

407
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,370
gateway run citrus to DA a distinction

408
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:34,149
others this must be positioned doesn't

409
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:38,199
it so discussion here is in this case

410
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:41,890
the DA receiving GTV pocket is a seed of

411
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:46,240
the end omgt p6 d associated to a citrus

412
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:48,280
described in this section 6.3 the deceit

413
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,250
Calgary at much perfidious system so

414
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,010
that it shouldn't be position basis the

415
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,050
proofs all proposed resolution aids the

416
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:59,320
modify the text on the sole bread to

417
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:05,409
align with section 6.3 that's our

418
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:09,460
proposal so next one please so next one

419
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:12,130
is the terminology the anchor the

420
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,160
comment is the draft seemed to use the

421
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:18,210
term anchor or anchoring quite a lot but

422
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,790
what exactly is means it's much unclear

423
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,940
it looks to me that the meaning change

424
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,399
during the progression of techies and

425
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,980
depends on the context as it appeared to

426
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,900
be such key term of the door I would

427
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,750
recommend that you define it somewhere

428
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:38,080
in this document a bit of fear and

429
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:41,920
discussion aids I try to find the

430
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,889
generic terminology but during that I

431
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,100
found Matt and Ella Mae would be example

432
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:52,270
in native tongue Polanco and of course

433
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:56,110
the is SP gateway and I UPF a UPS will

434
00:25:52,270 --> 00:26:00,190
be also a prepaid tom in CPP but I

435
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:06,659
couldn't find the generic term 2 means

436
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:11,170
it anchor so far so um I and also

437
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:13,750
couldn't come up with the exact proposal

438
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:17,320
resolution but we need to define our

439
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,419
discuss only cushion under directory so

440
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,889
if you look at the

441
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:24,539
definition of mobility anchor as we and

442
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:28,080
based on our prior work our mobile IP v4

443
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:30,299
v6 proximal ipv6 anchor is a topological

444
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,139
from routing point of it's an anchor of

445
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:38,309
the IP address right so ease the service

446
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:40,769
expect is it changing that those the the

447
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:43,678
fundamental aspect or is it defining a

448
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:46,259
new behavior or is it still an IP on the

449
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,090
ID point of view the U is such an IPS

450
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,009
anchor that's a topological entry and

451
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,699
exit point is that the case or something

452
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:56,580
different is the question thank you um

453
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:59,759
as we already explained that this user

454
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:03,960
frame I saw basic is a brain doesn't

455
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,669
depend or assumes it's specific the

456
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,039
architecture of the mobility like I see

457
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:14,460
is a VPN teammate that would be

458
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:18,509
applicable for the the the other all of

459
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,970
the the mobility networking how does

460
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:25,529
that I think we need to cover not only

461
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:29,669
for I Bianca but also the access network

462
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:32,309
anchoring like s gateway mag something

463
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:35,609
like that so in current terminology in

464
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:38,639
IETF it doesn't cover the such kind of

465
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:43,049
the access area on college so I could

466
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:45,928
cover that things but if if I try to put

467
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:51,059
some text on the anchoring definition I

468
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:54,330
try to put some sort of the the the

469
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:56,850
anchoring of means like mag and the

470
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:00,119
remaining I give time and speak a to AI

471
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:03,238
on the a UPF in CPM something like that

472
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,369
I think the way I look at it is anchor

473
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:07,830
also anchored doesn't mean it ties to a

474
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:09,480
specific protocol or people you know my

475
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,999
you know all right I think the way we

476
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,659
said was in the past

477
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:17,580
anchor means the the u.s. IP address is

478
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,129
topologically configured on that node

479
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,168
from the IP point of view that is for

480
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:24,418
the rest of the world that IP address

481
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:26,759
belongs to that node or at least that's

482
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,409
the entry point that for reaching that

483
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,349
IP address now

484
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,890
LM a is a form of an element when we

485
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:34,530
defined a

486
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,570
what we said was LMA is also an IP

487
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:39,629
anchor or home agent is also an IP

488
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:43,919
anchor so that's how we put it in but

489
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:45,450
now I think your definition of IP anchor

490
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,510
or whatever in the context of this

491
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,940
document we need to maybe discuss this

492
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,860
and see how it fits the existing

493
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,110
definition or existing understanding and

494
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,679
how what we are modifying here the

495
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,899
confusion we introduced is the we use a

496
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,630
lot

497
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,340
whether it is an Pianka access no access

498
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:09,900
into a concur so I want to make sure

499
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,760
make a career the anchoring in the

500
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,830
specific context in the speech of a

501
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:20,010
section or the use case Thanks just a

502
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,570
quick comment here that regardless of

503
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,210
all we see different anchoring points

504
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:27,030
they're all UPF Cindy in the new hygiene

505
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,950
stuff and this draft is not going to

506
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,770
modify the functions of those UVs the

507
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,870
signal weighting the data cavity yes the

508
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,330
actual function of those UPS defined by

509
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,979
the 3gpp architecture and you're not

510
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,260
causing any of course regardless of

511
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,300
earlier very going with the IP and

512
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,280
arcane cars of mobility and cars of

513
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,990
service and cars doesn't matter they all

514
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,950
knew yes Louis and we are all versus

515
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,990
reading each other yes so one way to

516
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,720
probably maneuver around the term

517
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:57,780
anchoring areas call them ups and then

518
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,880
these ups would be in connecting

519
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:04,080
different type of functions which cover

520
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,870
a bunch of but but one issue with that

521
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,740
approach reduction with UPF is a 3gpp

522
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,139
Tom all right

523
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,830
in general you know idea we don't have

524
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,330
that definition right so maybe we can

525
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,800
say anything but as long as we provide a

526
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,330
proper definition of or functionally

527
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,540
what it is if somebody looks at it from

528
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:29,970
3 or IP point of view if you can say UPF

529
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:32,190
is so-and-so then we are good monitor

530
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:33,570
but again like one one way we can

531
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,120
actually generalize this is basically

532
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:38,040
where the anchor point to me at least is

533
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,719
a function that we are providing whether

534
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,180
it is a policy enforcement function or

535
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,650
something like that right that's a rule

536
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,360
of anchor point so you want to actually

537
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,039
go through

538
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,870
every single type of banker that you can

539
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:48,700
find and basically wanted you skates in

540
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,889
this draft

541
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,950
fair point thanks ocean sorry Chanel

542
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,750
yeah suresh krisshnan ago and this is to

543
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,299
talk about examples rather than specific

544
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,679
thread you could say like hey like

545
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:02,330
examples of this functionality are da da

546
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,100
da right like so we can talk about I

547
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,658
think we kind of talked about this like

548
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,549
sound something in the email or mobile

549
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:11,450
ipv6 work but if I say hey like for

550
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:13,490
example the pdsn or like GSN kind of

551
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,840
thing right or big if it so I think that

552
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,679
would be like an easy way of like

553
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,330
avoiding press or specifying but so kind

554
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,690
of give something for people to anchor

555
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,860
their this idea like do like what they

556
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,870
understanding their our culture

557
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,399
absolutely I think the passwords that we

558
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,518
come across these Fridays and one

559
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:36,709
gateway or PDS and oh yeah oh man yeah

560
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:39,019
please I think anchor is a Isabel

561
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:41,059
well-defined terminus meaning and it

562
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:43,039
goes beyond that traffic traverses that

563
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:45,019
particular point to reach UE so it has

564
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,960
more policies for charger with and

565
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:51,740
monitoring whatever so since we talked

566
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,110
about traffic offload low traffic of

567
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,419
functions so that term doesn't hold it

568
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,490
exactly anymore because not all traffic

569
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:03,080
in packets need to traverse that kind of

570
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:04,700
view so in order terms of the men we

571
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,620
also try to look for alternative

572
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,200
technologies and came up with the DP and

573
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:12,080
EPA which was a bit of an anchor I did

574
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,889
open note so that could be a node or

575
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,129
then Gateway the terminus GDP and second

576
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:21,199
routing kind of extension Harris so I

577
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,980
think we can go around these three terms

578
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,090
all right

579
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,529
but we need a clear definition yeah

580
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,418
that's a good comment actually we did

581
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,980
try to capture those definitions in the

582
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:37,789
document but unfortunately we kill the

583
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:39,529
document so we writing our document one

584
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,720
of the 3gpp see people tell you get

585
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,909
corrected me on this part what I would

586
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,309
request is a minor comment don't change

587
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:48,230
the definition of what 3gpp does in this

588
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,879
fairness we don't have to redefine that

589
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,740
stuff

590
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,840
for example the PD assertion anchor

591
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,940
generally the original P gateway NTA

592
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,560
deployments and the UPF

593
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,870
slot of Oh

594
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,360
said one is the IP IP address assignment

595
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,219
to the UE and also bitrate enforcement

596
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,709
lawful intercept all this stuff happens

597
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:09,740
there are new functionality in the Phi G

598
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,880
which is introduced DP PF + uljl a UPF

599
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,250
they don't do that

600
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,890
right so in that sense the DGP has

601
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,870
particular way of defining it if you're

602
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,760
talking about UPF we should stick to

603
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,129
that and if it is possible refer to a

604
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,930
particular 3gpp document so that this

605
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,500
document would be consistent with 3gpp

606
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,280
definition

607
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,820
okay thanks more any other comments I

608
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:39,170
think ah but you have enough thank you

609
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:42,679
okay so next one is the TTP message

610
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:44,960
support so the comment AIDS we assume

611
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,680
message type is TTP message

612
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,560
TPD you and mrs. type number two five oh

613
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,560
five and cannot transfer gtp PIN which

614
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,020
used gtp message echo message type one

615
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,540
and deeply message echoed primates type

616
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:02,150
two should we add capability to

617
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,610
translate gtp echo - I am pissed

618
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:09,470
ICMP six or add stored it be message

619
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:11,540
type in some place so discussion middle

620
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:14,089
we will cover gtp message in this world

621
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,370
or not where we agree to cover in the

622
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,850
marker is a random type of the gtp

623
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:22,699
message in another documents so proposal

624
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,620
resolution here is cupboard III message

625
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,649
including and marker in another document

626
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:32,560
yes I really appreciate the someone

627
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:32,560
frontier to write down that document I

628
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,670
think that makes sense I think and I

629
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,380
always sat down that's a bigger work

630
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,790
item or at least you know that requires

631
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:46,400
some focus I think we should keep it out

632
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:51,250
of this document so next exercise please

633
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:54,230
so we done the the major point and we

634
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:57,950
categorize the list of the commented

635
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:02,620
minor but someone's easy a measure or

636
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:05,960
not but let's qualify the minor comment

637
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,180
in section five one one uplink packet

638
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,550
flow into Russian mode the comment is

639
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,430
what is a spec table where the lookup it

640
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,069
to be done

641
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,960
does this mean that to support more is a

642
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:18,480
brain there need to be an additional two

643
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,400
cup table a discussion here is this

644
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,529
mentioned typical behavior which took up

645
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,750
Phebe to find next up between reading

646
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:30,710
usual so proposed the resolution isn't

647
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:34,079
keep the current exist next one please

648
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:36,539
in Section five one two downlink packet

649
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,569
flow interaction mode in this case you

650
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:41,430
probably need a additional lookup table

651
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:44,460
to map the destination address of the ue

652
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:47,160
with others seed with the gene lb the

653
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,039
discussion is there's no need to look up

654
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,960
the you ers at all

655
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,630
so that she'd encode a surf the society

656
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,250
so proposed resolutions keep the current

657
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:00,950
a gift that's really straightforward

658
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:04,079
next one please

659
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:06,240
section five two five two one uplink

660
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,359
packet flow in hassle mode the comment

661
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,169
is what is others V shouldn't it be

662
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,710
others D what it t ID used in this case

663
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:20,160
so discussion here is address D a means

664
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:27,690
actually you you goddess eat to mapping

665
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:32,399
with a be as the eye for web it's a it's

666
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:34,349
a the seed and T is a tid the based on t

667
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,039
v-- perform a lookup to find the food

668
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:41,279
citrus so proposal resolution is keep

669
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:45,420
that current exist okay

670
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:47,880
next slide please section 5 2 enhancer

671
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,589
mode the comment aids how much overhead

672
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,809
does the use of the multiple seed

673
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:54,119
introduced and what is the impact to hit

674
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:58,670
the compression the discussion here is

675
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:01,589
which each seed had 16 bite but we can't

676
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:04,020
state exact side above ahead do - it

677
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:06,270
depends on the amount of the seed used

678
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,670
for traffic engine also support

679
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:12,240
programming when it comes to header

680
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:15,510
compression sr b6 is a brain doesn't

681
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,520
impact lock on radio interface so

682
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,650
proposal resolution is keep the current

683
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,660
a gist

684
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:25,279
how is this is the specific to this work

685
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,279
item or the base services

686
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:35,660
you know okay because maybe in the

687
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,240
spring working group in this time I

688
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:42,200
discussed some sort of idea

689
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:46,879
that's it compression solution he came

690
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:49,100
into that so next one is six twelve five

691
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,830
three one one uplink packet flow in

692
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,870
inter working with ipv6 DTP the comment

693
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:57,200
rate dated one instance of the end and

694
00:37:53,870 --> 00:38:00,230
gtp 60-seat papi do you type how is the

695
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,799
PDO type in run by use of tid the

696
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:06,430
discussion here is dt p 6d seat would be

697
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,140
instantiate puppeteer session type basis

698
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:13,930
the proposed resolution is keeps us

699
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:17,120
current the kissed the next slide please

700
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:19,850
sections five three one two downlink

701
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,100
packet row in the working with ipv6 TTP

702
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:25,400
the comment AIDS when the packet

703
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,440
destined to a arrived at a UPF to the

704
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,380
you give to perform a look up in the

705
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,560
table associated a how is this table

706
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:37,010
populated by the mobility signaling

707
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,470
croissant the discussion here is an for

708
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:43,640
signaling could be one solution other

709
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:46,160
could be CLI Netcom resko to configure

710
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,710
the table IP routing protocol such as

711
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:53,299
BGP for example to other path I'll

712
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:55,910
install the entry in the table so on the

713
00:38:53,300 --> 00:39:09,380
proposal resolution it keeps the context

714
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:11,359
I think so on we cross to end five three

715
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:15,380
one three scarab is a winter walking we

716
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:19,370
are gtp 6t Eid is covered by the Geno's

717
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:22,220
be and you tf2 same tid may appear for

718
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,080
different genome B's how the gtp echo

719
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,240
works for these cases

720
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,460
discussion ways as the last sheet

721
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,629
indicate generally address it makes

722
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,630
clear that Geno

723
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:35,330
don't be scoped in which the tid is kept

724
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,730
unique so proposal resolution is keep

725
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:42,400
the current exist

726
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:45,220
okay okay so end them up in Section six

727
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,230
to is a mapping tab user to step one

728
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,470
Mobile is a friend specific or is it

729
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,589
general for any SR basics if only for

730
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,750
more is a friend how is the populated

731
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:58,570
discussion waits the segment can be used

732
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,940
dinner general curry for NES a basic

733
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:03,400
functionality however in the context of

734
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,560
a mobility a unique and mapped segment

735
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,990
will be instantiated the proposed

736
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,950
solution is how to populate the mapping

737
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:15,009
table is out of the scope so on next one

738
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:17,649
I think would be respond it's also the

739
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,720
end map in Section six two to the

740
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:22,660
comment wait what is the segment that is

741
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,520
in line three is it segment list of the

742
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,118
original packet or is it new segment

743
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,400
list of the end map sorry function

744
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,619
discussion eight signal is here in

745
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,320
pseudocode should be citrus the new

746
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:38,470
mapped seat is bound to the citrus the

747
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:44,020
proposed resolution is add some text to

748
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:46,450
clarify the Bob okay so that's all we

749
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:50,410
qualified we'd like to clarify the

750
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:53,710
comment and the resolution so our next

751
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:57,460
shot a a next step is working with

752
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:02,319
rascal after when we reflect see a

753
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:05,619
substantial resolution to the draft and

754
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,490
also we need implementation otherwise

755
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:09,910
mentioned

756
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:14,129
at first we already have a PPP code and

757
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:17,790
also the p4 code as well by kentaro I

758
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:21,190
but we need more implementation and I

759
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:25,180
also be continued the hakusan project on

760
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:27,430
the the next ITF meeting so if you are

761
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:31,480
interesting to Hakkasan to be joined a

762
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,799
please calm thank you that's all thank

763
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,890
you

764
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,910
I think looks like you know this is

765
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:44,279
going on the right track

766
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:44,279
thank you so much okay next

767
00:41:50,620 --> 00:42:11,660
next one is transport network of air

768
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:13,160
mobility for Phi G John okay yeah I

769
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:25,819
think that's kind of working just let us

770
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:27,230
know this doesn't work oh hello

771
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,730
everybody my name is Uma I'm going to

772
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:32,660
talk about transport network of air

773
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:34,640
mobility for Phi G we going to talk

774
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,700
about the new addition we made to the

775
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,440
original proposal so first I will just

776
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,830
lay out the what what problem that is

777
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,600
being solved and what the new addition

778
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:54,500
that we made is will be talk my

779
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:57,049
colleague John ok so so in Phi G we all

780
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:02,300
know that various SSD modes have been

781
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:05,000
introduced but there is no clear mapping

782
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,820
function the sort of first two our first

783
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,160
thing is we're there with the underlying

784
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,530
slices transport network is not factored

785
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,149
because 3gpp will focus mostly on the

786
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,490
ran and the core network transport

787
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,530
network is the IETF but in some

788
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,709
scenarios in non mobility and mobility

789
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,270
cases for the underlying foreign to and

790
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:26,350
slicing functionality underlying

791
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:29,480
transport need to be factored let's say

792
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:31,610
for example non mobility cases if you

793
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,190
are if we are sending a PD you session

794
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:36,230
for the slice you need to make sure that

795
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,090
SLA guarantees for the end-to-end has to

796
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,770
be observed whether the transport

797
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:43,390
network will give you that are not that

798
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:46,340
need to be factored and during mobility

799
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:48,259
from G note B to G note B are from UPF

800
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,500
to UPF you need to make sure that

801
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:53,930
transport network also offers the same

802
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,060
QoS characteristics for the end-to-end

803
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,549
budget need to be factored so this is

804
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,110
the missing part so how to address this

805
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,349
is being described here there are two

806
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,930
approaches described

807
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:06,630
the second approach is added recently by

808
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:08,698
John and the second aspect what we're

809
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:12,029
discussing is there is no clear standard

810
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:14,069
mapping function to map this ran and

811
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:16,589
coordinate work to the transport so

812
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:20,099
there are various ways for slicing early

813
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:22,469
slicing solutions in 2016 for the LTE

814
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,420
networks there are ways people are used

815
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:29,969
to use to do this there are only two

816
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:31,259
batters there how they map to the PD

817
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:32,969
sessions to the underlying transport

818
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:35,279
there are various ways people pay people

819
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:36,660
are doing in national deployments so we

820
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:38,699
were thinking to do a standardized

821
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,558
mapping which is applicable to Phi G

822
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:42,900
also because a lot of parameters are

823
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,999
changed and the cue of Phi is inside the

824
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,930
gtp u extension header so creating as I

825
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,788
said the creating a reference

826
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,440
architecture to integrate the transport

827
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:55,680
backhaul network in Phi G service based

828
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,630
architecture so this integration will

829
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,999
help you get the transport network

830
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:02,069
functions exposed to the mobility

831
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:03,629
functions if you if you want to mobility

832
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:05,849
functions to other network functions in

833
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:07,229
the 3G control plane if you want the

834
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:09,180
transport functionality whether this

835
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:12,149
particular transport slice can give this

836
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,649
much QoS at this much latency that can

837
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,410
be based on that the traditions can be

838
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,910
made so under and as we said the

839
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,170
providing clear mapping function to

840
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,049
integrate video sessions to the

841
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:24,209
underlying transport also this describes

842
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:26,309
a new path routing mechanism that is

843
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:28,410
called preferred path routing this is

844
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:30,269
like any other TV mechanism that is

845
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,328
there in the IETF right now right from

846
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:35,879
rsvp-te we have last 20 years and thus

847
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:38,670
our MPLS RSR v6

848
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,559
today of course a service 6 can do much

849
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,420
more things than underlip your underlay

850
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,029
transport it can do service mapping also

851
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,309
like suit are explained where it can be

852
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:49,440
replacing gtp but traditionally

853
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:50,759
transport or traffic engineering do only

854
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,339
the underlay transport traffic

855
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:56,339
engineering that is like RSVP TAS are

856
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:59,038
MPLS so PPR is a new transport mechanism

857
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:01,109
where it can do a path steering without

858
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,180
any overhead and it also additional

859
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:04,769
benefits PPR brings in and how this fits

860
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,169
into the Phi G mobility has been

861
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:08,669
explained in this document that is to

862
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,430
validate the reference architecture we

863
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:13,739
put forth how this mechanism can be used

864
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,060
with PPR but however the reference our

865
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:16,830
HR put forth can be

866
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:20,160
like to any te technology existing in

867
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:22,620
the idea from rsvp-te to SR MPLS to SR

868
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,120
v6 as a pure transport underlay not the

869
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,770
service programming and the pure

870
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,339
transport under layer service six can be

871
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:30,750
used so that is explained here so more

872
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,710
one question right for my own

873
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:37,020
understanding just curiosity is this was

874
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:39,720
this presented in 3gpp or any of the

875
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,720
history of Orcs sorry was this presented

876
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,149
in 3gpp or is this a reviewing know that

877
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,480
no no it's not presented in 3gpp one of

878
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:50,220
the CT for delicate in Russian to he had

879
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,060
significant modifications to the text

880
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,450
and he was a co-author now so it was but

881
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:02,490
it's an IETF document it's not present

882
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:05,520
at all so this proposal doesn't remove

883
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:07,589
gtp as we said that this is a underlie

884
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,990
functionality it doesn't touch the

885
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:13,290
overlays like gtp whatever the gtp it

886
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,729
has functionally does but SR v6 even

887
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:20,610
though we discuss here this is only an

888
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:22,440
underlay transport not service hi can

889
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:25,080
you elaborate on what you mean by

890
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:33,030
provide a clear mapping function like

891
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:35,160
are you defining an API or okay the

892
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:38,130
mapping function is when a packet hits

893
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,890
at the G note B are the UPF how this

894
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,180
what needs to be done to map this to the

895
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,819
underlying transport like say if I'm

896
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:47,040
using rsvp-te tunnel what needs to be

897
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:54,630
done for the medium video session to map

898
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:56,820
to this rsvp-te tunnel yes yes that's it

899
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,470
the changes the major change what we

900
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,730
introduced was we come up with one

901
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,730
approach first in the first three

902
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:05,070
sections of us three versions then later

903
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,780
on John frum took it from the different

904
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,980
point of view and he said that we have

905
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,650
to minimize the changes in the

906
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:13,080
architecture so we talking about this

907
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:14,610
but these are unresolved issues that's

908
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,160
why we want expose this and we won't

909
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:18,750
eventually image these two approaches

910
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,100
into one approach eventually that's so

911
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:26,300
that's where we asked for working group

912
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:26,299
adoption we are not ready yet yeah

913
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:34,520
yes I have a question for you

914
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:37,819
it is gonna touch the MPS layer oh yeah

915
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,860
so it doesn't touch MPLS layer if one of

916
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,990
the de technologies we try to do

917
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,390
whatever the IETF has developed so many

918
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:46,910
te technologies right from rsvp-te to s

919
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,970
our MPLS tests our v6 and the PPR we are

920
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:52,370
working on we don't want to touch

921
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,930
anything there we were just seeing in

922
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:56,060
the PPR how we can the reference

923
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:58,000
architecture can be applied to the PPR

924
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:00,110
the new path routing mechanism we

925
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,640
introduced that's what we are trying to

926
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:15,350
do we are not changing anything in the

927
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:19,700
MPLS I don't disappoint okay that's good

928
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:21,290
so qci is an LTE LTE deployments that's

929
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,629
that's it's that that's where exactly in

930
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:25,430
some deployments based on the QCA and

931
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:27,920
qsr functionality mapping is happening

932
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:30,680
in some cases people are reading judy

933
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,230
GTP you once the GTP encapsulation

934
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,710
happens UDP so space mapping are being

935
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,450
used

936
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:37,700
UDP source based mapping to gia

937
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:39,439
underlying rsvp-te tunnels are sr MPLS

938
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,509
tunnels are being used there are so many

939
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,490
ways people are deploying we just trying

940
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:46,700
to see whether we can standardize this

941
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:48,859
for Phi G there is a q5 field in the GTP

942
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,839
header that's one way to map this key of

943
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,400
Phi to underlying transport or there are

944
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,440
so many other ways we can do he is

945
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,540
talking about new into identifiers that

946
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,830
can be used to map this clearly there

947
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,300
are so many ways we can do that's what

948
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:09,460
we are trying to standardize here trying

949
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:09,460
to yes yes at some point at some point

950
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:30,740
so like that that's kind of for our

951
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,150
sonic doors gonna wait till the end of

952
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,919
it like to figure out like what's your

953
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:37,610
next steps gonna be right because we

954
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,170
gonna have to somehow topple 3gpp and

955
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,970
see if it fits the needs or whatever if

956
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,940
you're doing this because it's

957
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:47,240
to be targeted or 3gpp right no it's not

958
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:50,000
specifically target overstays by G no

959
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,040
Phi G Phi G PDO session comes as a

960
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,650
transport network point of view how I

961
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:57,109
use my te tunnel to map to the PDO

962
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:59,060
session that's what I'm looking into and

963
00:50:57,109 --> 00:51:01,880
the user of that would be like somebody

964
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:04,040
working on the Phi J architecture right

965
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,840
so I'm just thinking like how do we

966
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,670
communicate this exists and how do we

967
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,010
come in how do you find out if this

968
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:11,840
meets their needs right and a couple of

969
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,580
things right like it's like a nose ring

970
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,780
before right like so what what we can do

971
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,720
is like you know send earliest instead

972
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,280
in saying there's existing right and but

973
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,480
but again like you know I I keep

974
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,460
repeating this for a lot of things

975
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,690
somebody on the 3gpp side needs to do it

976
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,390
you said you're talking with somebody at

977
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:28,580
cd4 right I think this also needs to be

978
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:30,410
worked on in 3gpp to include this and

979
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,670
the second so one of them is earliest

980
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,170
and is something we can do and the

981
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,580
second thing is like what you've done in

982
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:36,890
the past for like previous generations

983
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,960
like Ettie like what we've done is like

984
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,730
we had a dependency less so this is a

985
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,369
differential s there's like a it used to

986
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,660
be a spreadsheet but now it's like more

987
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:46,700
formal way of like tracking this stuff

988
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,319
we're like you know if 3gpp is

989
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,368
interested in this like it goes into

990
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,440
something we track so we had a

991
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:52,730
coordination meeting I was there in the

992
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,780
meetings on on Monday

993
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:58,460
gi-give board meeting so the idea is

994
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,570
like this goes on the dependency list so

995
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,950
like like 3gpp knows the status of this

996
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,210
and we also know like if 3gpp is

997
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,098
interested I think that's really the

998
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:09,020
interesting thing that could be really

999
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:11,660
independent from like what happens in

1000
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,759
idea but if you really want something to

1001
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,440
happen in 3gpp connected to this we want

1002
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,520
to do these steps definitely thank you

1003
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,869
yeah that's the reason I was asking but

1004
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,030
I just want to say one thing we are

1005
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:25,220
still not ready yet we have still two

1006
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:27,230
approaches we want to resolve this maybe

1007
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,459
next question we will be in that as

1008
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:34,550
taste where we can expose this to

1009
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:37,250
further so just to add to what you're

1010
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:38,869
saying in 3gpp so if there are multiple

1011
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,720
groups we need to consider

1012
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:44,119
there's sa5 from a management context

1013
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,290
that is pretty much in line with some of

1014
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:50,060
the interfaces here the SA to work on

1015
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,560
the architecture those folks don't think

1016
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,810
that anything is needed at this point

1017
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,730
that's not like so there's there's even

1018
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,529
a wide list

1019
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,520
like if you tell me this is something

1020
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,290
you want to send the working group

1021
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,820
address on what's the content of this

1022
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:03,279
liaison statement right yeah I can ship

1023
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:06,100
it off to multiple people right yeah so

1024
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,570
Leonel is the ECT chair so like I say

1025
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,950
like I think probably I had to go

1026
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:11,050
through Gonzalo

1027
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,279
which was like place and the 3gpp not

1028
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:14,260
specifically if you don't have a

1029
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,630
specific person to talk to in in the SI

1030
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,460
groups but I I can ship it off to like a

1031
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,900
wide distribution as far as potentially

1032
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,670
interested ship but after them they say

1033
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,359
nothing lot of times they say nothing

1034
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,369
that's okay

1035
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:25,690
but the idea is like to be cautious and

1036
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,640
say like send it to the largest

1037
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:29,109
distribution overall I kind of agree

1038
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,089
with what am I saying is that we should

1039
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:33,160
probably try to coordinate a few things

1040
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:36,040
and then ship it to three because we're

1041
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,868
trying to limit the number of any

1042
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,270
overlap with 3gpp trying to make it

1043
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:42,820
clear that it's work that IETF should do

1044
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:45,160
and that the part what we're trying to

1045
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,600
be a that's a goal is to minimize the

1046
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,549
architectural changes no architecture

1047
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,160
change changes is our coal but at the

1048
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:52,780
end of the day we need to know that what

1049
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,069
we are trying to do here because it is

1050
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,070
related to their technology eventually

1051
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:05,410
you know I cannot tell you right or what

1052
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:08,350
I'm saying is like it's better to like

1053
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,490
stop early because like the 3gpp process

1054
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,900
can happen and finally because it's

1055
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,879
probably like a three-month delay from

1056
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,710
which when we start something it has to

1057
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,390
3gpp so we had to go through a meeting

1058
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:18,700
cycle I had to work on the liaison like

1059
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,529
ship it off and just like a 3gpp meeting

1060
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,960
cycle before somebody looks at it right

1061
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:24,910
so whenever you're ready you talk to

1062
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,940
thank you this is really valuable but

1063
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:30,790
for the working groups in the 3gpp side

1064
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:34,180
John also mentioned the problem working

1065
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:36,220
group is as say 264 and SF 5 these three

1066
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:38,169
working groups like what I'm saying it's

1067
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,930
like when you're ready to like take this

1068
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:44,050
one step further you go talk to receptor

1069
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,368
Sun and defying right and they pull the

1070
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,740
most moved consensus and they ship it

1071
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:49,030
off to me and and I do the stuff because

1072
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,020
there's like a process for this and it

1073
00:54:49,030 --> 00:55:03,310
all takes time right so thank you Thanks

1074
00:54:52,020 --> 00:55:05,290
okay continuation right John so I'll try

1075
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:08,710
to continue from

1076
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:10,360
we're on my left off so this is mainly

1077
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:14,800
addressing the changes that we added

1078
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:22,210
into into the revision 4 we have some

1079
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:24,640
time think so so then I guess the main

1080
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:27,130
things that are changed are in Chapter

1081
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,740
2.2 and let me identify what exactly

1082
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:33,730
that is you know so it's it's a mapping

1083
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:37,270
between the 3gpp 5 G's slices to the

1084
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:41,170
transport slices elaborating on that a

1085
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:43,380
little bit so the 5 g q s and slice

1086
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:47,830
information that's carried in NS s AI

1087
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:52,690
what is offered or is offered in the PDU

1088
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:55,390
context to a ue that does not have a

1089
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:57,310
direct relation to what a transport

1090
00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:01,330
network provides a transport networks

1091
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:04,299
clients are the 3gpp operators so

1092
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:10,000
they're offering slice or slice services

1093
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:14,460
to a 3gpp operator whereas a 3gpp PDU

1094
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,860
session are slice offers to a Yui and

1095
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,330
these these have a you know end to em

1096
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:22,270
kind of relationship it's not a

1097
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:24,390
one-to-one of any sort so they're

1098
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:27,220
definitely so we are mapping between

1099
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:29,350
these two just to take it a little bit

1100
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,509
further if you take those segments for

1101
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:33,069
example if you have an N 3 segments that

1102
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:34,750
may be provided by one transport

1103
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:37,090
provider and another segment may be

1104
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:40,300
provided by another one in not

1105
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:42,490
necessarily but it could be worse versus

1106
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,650
if you take that transport provider they

1107
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:46,990
may be serving multiple clients like a

1108
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:50,650
mobile operator or a fixed operator CDN

1109
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:52,240
and so on so clearly there needs to be a

1110
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:56,670
mapping between what's offered and the

1111
00:56:52,240 --> 00:57:02,770
transport and a 3gpp provider requests

1112
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:06,400
the point in B is related to I mean how

1113
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:08,050
it was solved partly in 4G and I think I

1114
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,720
might just on this of this discussion

1115
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:13,960
came up with the MPLS question to part

1116
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,419
of it is that what we are trying to map

1117
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,650
through and identify here was probably

1118
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,530
solved within a node

1119
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:25,579
which terminated the 3gpp as well as a

1120
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:27,440
transport function like an MPLS so the

1121
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:30,440
translation was done within a node and

1122
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,280
it was okay but as was identified

1123
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:37,790
insurance Acamas and and the the draft

1124
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:40,339
in on user plane analysis if the nodes

1125
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:43,700
are distinct then there needs to be a

1126
00:57:40,339 --> 00:57:47,480
means by which to come convey this and I

1127
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:49,848
think point C is that between the two

1128
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,490
five D functions it may cross multiple

1129
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:54,470
layer 2 networks it could be that the

1130
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,810
UPF is on a server card that crosses a

1131
00:57:54,470 --> 00:58:00,140
datacenter Network and then on to a

1132
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:01,578
backhaul network so you know we need a

1133
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:04,220
reliable means to convey this

1134
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:08,510
information so any examples of the l2

1135
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:12,919
issues just yeah I guess the l2 issue

1136
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:16,130
would be for example if we put let's say

1137
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:19,550
a VLAN or something like that on a in a

1138
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:21,619
data center what would it mean in a

1139
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:25,160
backhaul network we need to have

1140
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:26,869
explicit translations for all l2 to all

1141
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:30,170
other relatives or at least a popular

1142
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:34,460
actors so that's much cleaner is to have

1143
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:38,050
a means by which you can convey this

1144
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:41,920
information across that segment and

1145
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:47,420
that's what I think we'll try to cover

1146
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:53,240
in this point here the we're introducing

1147
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:56,810
a mapping identifier or a context it's a

1148
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,939
mobile transport network context I think

1149
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:01,970
some of it was described in the previous

1150
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:05,119
slide so it's it Maps a class of service

1151
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:08,390
it should be 5qi on slice and other

1152
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:11,030
information that pertains to a 3gpp

1153
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:13,670
domain to a slice instance in the

1154
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:15,319
transport domain meaning the

1155
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:17,810
functionality that a transport domain

1156
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:21,170
can deliver and that would be a contract

1157
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:28,130
between the 3gpp domain and the

1158
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:31,220
transport of X so this is generated by I

1159
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,710
mean this mapping can be done ahead of

1160
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:35,490
time

1161
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:39,940
not necessarily when a session arrives

1162
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:44,680
and it is generated by the TNF now this

1163
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:48,090
function is probably in in a part of the

1164
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,589
3gpp management domain the NSS mmm or

1165
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:56,710
some such things which we don't want to

1166
00:59:50,590 --> 01:00:00,790
get into but I think the essay 5 which

1167
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:03,030
works on om and management are probably

1168
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:06,730
looking to adopt something like a CTN

1169
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:09,310
kind of work so you know they have very

1170
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:11,230
similar specifications so there's that's

1171
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:16,960
a point of coordination really need in

1172
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:19,450
the future so how it generates or

1173
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,430
figures out which slides need to be

1174
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:24,850
mapped is something that 3gpp should

1175
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:27,609
solve we only say here that there is a

1176
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:30,220
mapping that needs to be installed in

1177
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:32,920
the transport domain and it serves of

1178
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,470
the contract between the two as

1179
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,460
mentioned earlier it's not a one-to-one

1180
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:40,870
Association because that just would not

1181
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:43,360
even scale and we don't want to add

1182
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:44,950
additional delay and processing when we

1183
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:48,040
want to establish a session there must

1184
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:50,439
be an estimation of what is needed ahead

1185
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:53,170
of each individual session establishment

1186
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:59,100
and of course we want an identifier that

1187
01:00:53,170 --> 01:01:02,740
scales so the way this one scales is Oh

1188
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:06,520
n square with respect to the number of

1189
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:08,589
sites but not I mean it and that n

1190
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:12,009
square is much lower than the number of

1191
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:14,380
flows so as an example if we have three

1192
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:18,630
traffic classes and insights and we end

1193
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:21,370
25 sites then we need only about 900

1194
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:23,950
that's just an example in a small area

1195
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:33,810
let's say which would be much smaller

1196
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:33,810
than hundreds of thousands of flows ok

1197
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:47,569
so this figure is trying to show both

1198
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:52,249
the 3gpp functions and transport

1199
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:58,819
functions everything in that blue not a

1200
01:01:52,249 --> 01:02:03,890
box but house rule like box is part of

1201
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:08,089
3gpp functions and I've identified three

1202
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:09,769
steps so I'll try to go into sequence to

1203
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:12,380
say what happens it's roughly in time

1204
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:15,859
sequence also but not exactly because

1205
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:18,769
there are a couple of control loops so

1206
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:21,890
the TNF as we described earlier may be

1207
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:23,839
part of some 3gpp function we only care

1208
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:27,999
about the functionality that it

1209
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:31,730
interfaces with an SDN controller here

1210
01:02:27,999 --> 01:02:34,759
it defines a contract to say deliver

1211
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:37,690
these services I mean their resources

1212
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:42,140
that are needed for a three TPP slice I

1213
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:44,619
identified by this M TNC the SDN control

1214
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:50,029
of programs this in the pu routers as

1215
01:02:44,619 --> 01:02:52,369
needed all and at that point the TNF has

1216
01:02:50,029 --> 01:02:54,650
configured an empty and C has a valid

1217
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:58,999
contract between the transporter and the

1218
01:02:54,650 --> 01:03:01,579
mobile network what we're not showing in

1219
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:06,069
the figure is how an SMA for a UPF

1220
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:08,059
figures out that it is this empty and C

1221
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:10,220
that's needed

1222
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:12,470
that's their would be part of 3gpp

1223
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,779
networks and hence not described in

1224
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:20,269
detail here but there's some way that an

1225
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:22,220
SMF figures out that this empty and C

1226
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:27,439
can be associated to this PDS session

1227
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:29,808
and that's what is then m2 or the n4

1228
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,989
interfaces when there's a PD you session

1229
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:35,390
establish not so so this is all

1230
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:37,249
happening before a traffic flow starts

1231
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:40,670
so at the point that a traffic flow

1232
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:43,009
starts the you P you use a plane nodes

1233
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:46,190
and just for reference that you supply

1234
01:03:43,009 --> 01:03:49,930
nodes are the G note B and a UPF so it

1235
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:53,150
could be n 3 or n 9 in this case

1236
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:56,990
they already have the empty NCI teen

1237
01:03:53,150 --> 01:04:01,700
identifiers and at that point the UPF is

1238
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:04,490
going to map the empty NZ identifiers

1239
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:07,370
and send it out along with the PD

1240
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:09,950
accession packet the PE router is going

1241
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:14,170
to inspect that MTN C identifier and

1242
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:17,899
deliver the resources that were

1243
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:19,760
configured earlier and all of that is

1244
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:23,090
provisioned as and one of the techniques

1245
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,130
we may use as you know the PPR that Omar

1246
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:26,920
described earlier in terms of how that

1247
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:30,260
transport network is going to deliver

1248
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:32,930
those resources or you know how it is

1249
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:35,810
being routed and so on so those are the

1250
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:37,430
three steps first provisioning the empty

1251
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:41,870
NC identifiers based on traffic

1252
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:46,870
estimates secondly to classify the PDU

1253
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:50,029
session packet at the U PMF and thirdly

1254
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:59,089
the point where the P router inspects

1255
01:04:50,030 --> 01:05:01,280
and delivers resources aren't paths so

1256
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:04,640
this page is a little bit mixed up over

1257
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:09,070
there but I will talk through this so

1258
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:11,900
one of the problems is if the u PMF adds

1259
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:14,660
this identifier there must be some way

1260
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:18,680
to carry it in an IP packet in each IP

1261
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:20,779
packet and as mentioned earlier layer

1262
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:23,359
two ones are not suitable because you

1263
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:26,000
may cross multiple networks GTB

1264
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,920
extension is really quite bad actually

1265
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,210
in this case because it would take a

1266
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,670
long time to inspect where that MTN CID

1267
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:38,950
is if it is chained in a gtp extension

1268
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:42,650
so actually that's not a good idea other

1269
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:46,250
exchange like dscp or ipv6 flow labels

1270
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:50,150
are not immutable and hence not suitable

1271
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:54,200
also we are considering a few here

1272
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:58,700
it could be gue or SR v6 and one the

1273
01:05:54,200 --> 01:06:02,089
flow here shows the gue extension to add

1274
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:02,960
the MTN CID so essentially if you have a

1275
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:05,089
packet

1276
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:09,740
the PE router sees with this empty and

1277
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:14,660
CID it adds the appropriate forwarding

1278
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:17,959
information that's needed I presented

1279
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:22,490
this yesterday and T's and one of the

1280
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:28,010
comments we got was to also consider the

1281
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:31,399
option of adding a fast ticket and that

1282
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:33,369
is something we will look at it may have

1283
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,880
some advantages in terms of inspection

1284
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:45,470
but will also have to follow the

1285
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:47,690
progress on that okay so so which is

1286
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:52,790
Gio's will it impact when you guys and

1287
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:55,550
do this mapping here right I think this

1288
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:58,069
is an area where the ITF has to do

1289
01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:01,069
things I you know will have to specify

1290
01:06:58,069 --> 01:07:03,770
things here the other things I suppose

1291
01:07:01,069 --> 01:07:07,190
are more information I mean or some

1292
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:09,680
other things are more informational but

1293
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:12,470
here they mean 3gpp or anybody else

1294
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:15,589
would have to rely on at least partly

1295
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:17,598
IETF specifications so one of the

1296
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:20,450
problem is approach it is specified in

1297
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,400
the version 3 we were not trying to

1298
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:25,040
change anything in the gtp packet so

1299
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,599
we're trying to use such maybe here if I

1300
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,339
filled in the chiquita extension header

1301
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:30,589
but the problem is in this scenario

1302
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:32,930
speed router has to delete with deep

1303
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:34,849
into the gtp extension and aftermath of

1304
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:36,859
the transport tunnel which is lot of

1305
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:38,990
routers can't do that so that's why this

1306
01:07:36,859 --> 01:07:41,058
identified was brought in so which will

1307
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:45,109
easy of the routers to laughs quickly to

1308
01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:47,059
the transporters right the qfi has works

1309
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:53,779
on the downstream and again on the

1310
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:55,970
upstream it causes problem too yeah

1311
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,890
so yeah I mean that's a point that I

1312
01:07:55,970 --> 01:08:00,618
missed adding you know about the qfi I

1313
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:03,049
mean I think I must clarify that just

1314
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:04,520
say that you know it it it can provide a

1315
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:07,460
mapping between the bearer on the

1316
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:10,520
downstream which may be of some use but

1317
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:14,530
on the upstream you don't have so that's

1318
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,530
that's the rationale for all of this

1319
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:24,600
and yes Eric line just to clarifying

1320
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:29,640
question so the PPU packet here you say

1321
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:32,400
is a GG PU payload possibly yes easy to

1322
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,700
be rather reducing the the MTU by 12 4

1323
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:41,429
bytes

1324
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:43,979
yes that is a trade off yes so if

1325
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:46,350
somebody says John you can just index

1326
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:51,179
into the gtp you is if the decoding part

1327
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:53,730
or what is it so I can I can say that

1328
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:55,890
the challenge is simply that transport

1329
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:59,459
devices don't look so deep in to figure

1330
01:08:55,890 --> 01:09:02,270
out on every packet or even if it had to

1331
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:06,270
it would be rather expensive to parse

1332
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:10,259
some location that's you know not a very

1333
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:13,819
clear point I think the parses are going

1334
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:16,920
to be looking at the extension header

1335
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:20,790
and you know the transport would be able

1336
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:25,440
to look at autism certain mishima so on

1337
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:28,140
okay so on the the the one of the idea

1338
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:32,370
the bits are bite in the header to put

1339
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:34,680
the empty CID the I think you already

1340
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:36,568
mentioned that yes L v6

1341
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:41,430
at one of the transport with the use of

1342
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:46,920
play but what if we put the MTS CID in

1343
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:52,170
this a PC user brain part I mean the

1344
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:54,690
seat can be indicate to the NTSC kind of

1345
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:57,380
things I think that will absolutely work

1346
01:09:54,690 --> 01:10:01,110
okay so but I will be concerned that the

1347
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:03,750
UC DSM v6 as we just transport not so

1348
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:05,460
he's afraid so let me see if I

1349
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:07,800
understood your point correctly I mean

1350
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:12,300
so for example following the previous

1351
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:15,719
picture just to put it in context so the

1352
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:19,530
the NT NT identifies a program at those

1353
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:24,480
two points and that is mapped into an SR

1354
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:26,040
v6 you know segment at that node right

1355
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,500
yeah so

1356
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:30,600
that's not a problem because I mean I

1357
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,760
think the concern we have is we do not

1358
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,190
want to change any of the existing 3gpp

1359
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:40,320
specifications and doing this would not

1360
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:42,269
change any other so I mean we haven't

1361
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:52,469
worked a lot into detail on that but we

1362
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:56,610
could explore that okay I think that's

1363
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:58,080
more or less what we have so at this

1364
01:10:56,610 --> 01:11:00,420
point we're looking for comments and

1365
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,150
suggestions and we'll have to work as

1366
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:06,420
OMA mentioned to unify these different

1367
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:08,759
approaches in particular I think we got

1368
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:10,590
some feedback on the slide 7 from T's

1369
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,400
but you know would be happy to get more

1370
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:13,380
input

1371
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:21,210
I think Eric gave us some input about

1372
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:23,430
the 12 bytes you know is there any other

1373
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:26,160
approach we can think of without

1374
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:29,250
modifying packets and you know putting

1375
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:32,309
out other identifiers but he is the

1376
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:34,080
mapping at the routers also not looking

1377
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:36,390
at deep into the gtp extension ladder to

1378
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,860
get the any particular value currencies

1379
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,960
any other approaches we can do that's

1380
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,670
awesome actually so his point we get

1381
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:48,150
will not we cannot be knee not one for

1382
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:52,770
more thanks but I didn't think yeah

1383
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:55,710
sorry I'm way not familiar with enough

1384
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:57,290
things here but is there space in the I

1385
01:11:55,710 --> 01:12:00,120
think you're sending it to the EPF IP

1386
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:02,280
I'm sorry you're sending it to the the

1387
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:05,580
destination of this thing is from the G

1388
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:10,290
no be to the user plain function yes

1389
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:15,570
yeah yeah I mean right so is it possible

1390
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:17,490
that the user playing this unit yeah let

1391
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:20,700
me just clarify that exactly you know so

1392
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:23,880
each of these functions can be either a

1393
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:26,700
G note B or a UPF so in the upstream

1394
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,860
direction you know on an entry that one

1395
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:34,200
may be a gene gene or B and this may be

1396
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:36,389
a UPF so okay is it possible that those

1397
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,120
things could have instead of individual

1398
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:42,330
IP addresses entire / 60 force

1399
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,680
that they own for the results their code

1400
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:46,050
been writing forward to them and they

1401
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,760
wasn't essentially the entire / 64 the

1402
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:50,370
way a phone does so you won't being

1403
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,640
decorated our dress with or without in

1404
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:56,790
fact yeah I think that may be close to

1405
01:12:53,640 --> 01:13:08,310
or DOMA is suggesting it a PBR that's

1406
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:09,840
interesting point yeah so if ipv6

1407
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:12,900
addresses used at the session anchors

1408
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:15,870
would you not be and UPF perhaps this

1409
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:18,059
last 64 can be used other part can be

1410
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:24,150
used to put this identifier yes this one

1411
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:26,640
of the ideas is a non topological 64 to

1412
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:28,559
the data center host cell phones have

1413
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,780
such divorce writer to them everything

1414
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,340
you send anything in that 64 gets to

1415
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:34,200
that phone whether it keeps it or drops

1416
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:38,810
or whatever look what happens if these

1417
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:41,760
are ipv4 addresses that's that's I mean

1418
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:43,920
ygg for transport okay that's a fair

1419
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,630
point yeah this is this is traversing

1420
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,350
the public you know this is reversing a

1421
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:52,290
series of provider only surprise box

1422
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:54,480
can you mandate their v6 no not if not

1423
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:56,850
worldwide you know then then then then

1424
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:00,150
in v6 you can do this and before you can

1425
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:05,400
lose four you can lose 12 bytes say that

1426
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:08,990
make it clear any comment on the that's

1427
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:12,299
the discussion on when we could see some

1428
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:15,599
do information on the ipv6 to indicate

1429
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:17,370
the yes wise we I think the SMF need to

1430
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,490
control the end point of the year the

1431
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:23,280
digital session so that may touch the

1432
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:25,469
change of the HTTP architecture I don't

1433
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:27,480
think it'd be fit correct

1434
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:30,360
I'd say with the architecture if you cut

1435
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:33,500
the top semantics in ipv6 that's my

1436
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:38,070
comment okay so my my another comment on

1437
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:40,590
this idea so other Amida you mention

1438
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:43,559
that it's not touched to the agrees to

1439
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:46,470
touching using architecture to be

1440
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:50,640
changed it must be a much more generic

1441
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:52,830
solution to see the pocket to map the to

1442
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:56,070
the specifics rising

1443
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:59,880
think it'd be not to mobile-specific

1444
01:14:56,070 --> 01:15:04,380
it's much more general so if you want to

1445
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:09,690
proceed your idea to see the yeah

1446
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:12,870
that's mapping solution so I think it'll

1447
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:18,540
be e to touch to the some sort of the

1448
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:21,870
VPN solution working group to propose

1449
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:26,250
your idea because it kind with the

1450
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:29,849
appear Rooter behavior to to look up the

1451
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:33,450
ID to find the appropriate it's rising

1452
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:37,760
in the course I know I think that's much

1453
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:41,849
more smooth way to proceed your idea

1454
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:44,160
Thanks we'd like to work with you then

1455
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:47,310
you know and I can work of you a lot of

1456
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:51,120
details in there and thanks thank you

1457
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:54,300
thank you John any final you know that's

1458
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:56,160
that's okay yeah so I think feedback

1459
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,200
again I think are it's interesting topic

1460
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,059
we need more discussions and I think you

1461
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:02,460
know the number of touch points here I

1462
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:04,530
think is do feedback and all of that is

1463
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,030
Suresh pointed out right but I think

1464
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:09,630
it's truly the ball is in the authors

1465
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:18,929
coast really you know do more work all

1466
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:22,560
right thank you next one is what ii use

1467
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:26,100
a plane an optical analysis of the 3g

1468
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:32,240
purifies your system by meeow meeow

1469
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:36,620
Sarkis on and I think just okay cool

1470
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:36,620
homie is not there right okay how my son

1471
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:21,370
oh cool thank you okay thank you I'm

1472
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,370
talking music of mmm talking about

1473
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:28,180
updates as fives you use a Brea nice to

1474
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:31,090
have on behalf of these causes so

1475
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:33,430
background background of this draft is

1476
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:38,260
not changed so I will skip this right

1477
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:41,290
and the history of disrupt and after the

1478
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:45,640
ITA Prague meeting we update this draft

1479
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:49,420
for deflecting a URL see and also as a

1480
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:58,600
POC state information but on the other

1481
01:17:49,420 --> 01:18:01,440
two okay thank you and this wrists shows

1482
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:09,370
a major update of this version and

1483
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:13,540
faster we re does try service type we'll

1484
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:14,349
just leave it there thank you sorry is

1485
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:17,410
it okay

1486
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:21,160
yes thank you so we added a thrice

1487
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:25,870
service type in the section 4.1 and this

1488
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:28,540
SSD is defined by sweetie pp and it

1489
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:33,849
represents type of the network's for

1490
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:37,990
instance and so if we define the for

1491
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:42,970
type four types of the standard SSD EMA

1492
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:46,660
pu r LC m io t and b TX and also a it is

1493
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:49,390
a PCP stage information and you are

1494
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:53,280
areas related requirement and a

1495
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:55,660
variation aspect and i will show you the

1496
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:59,830
details of these things at the

1497
01:18:55,660 --> 01:19:03,250
followings right and this is the fuchsia

1498
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:05,650
p state information so PF CP is a

1499
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:10,570
routing protocol which is utilized

1500
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:14,410
between the SMF and UPF and p by using

1501
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:18,320
the PSAP protocol as SMS can advertise

1502
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:21,590
user playing configuration choose

1503
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:25,610
UPF in order to establish the PDU

1504
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:29,060
session for the requested Yui and also

1505
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:32,839
in this version we saw we summarize the

1506
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:36,770
three TPP defined plcp information

1507
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:39,290
element as like ID friend or a young

1508
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:42,320
data motor right this one and also by

1509
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:47,480
using this kind of data model so SMS

1510
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:50,120
count she advertised such can pocket

1511
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:52,759
detection rule and flooding action dude

1512
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:56,150
and Q s enforcement rule and uses

1513
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:59,480
reporting due to the UPF and after that

1514
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:02,570
you pH can four walls I encourage it if

1515
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:05,719
you it by looking the PDR dual and

1516
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:08,059
attach the adequate outer heater by

1517
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:12,110
looking up supporting action rule and

1518
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:14,660
the sends adequate no right judging on

1519
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:20,599
the be or theater Network who another

1520
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:22,820
UPF so URL see you are yours URL see

1521
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:25,790
means oratory diable or agency

1522
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:28,820
communication and your specifications

1523
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:32,720
that you are is Area C is added at 3:16

1524
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:35,000
and actually you re received requires a

1525
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:39,770
redundant data transfer to use a praying

1526
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:46,270
in order to avoid the service disruption

1527
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:46,270
in case of a user profile and country 23

1528
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:56,420
the previous page yeah the m4 and PF CP

1529
01:20:52,340 --> 01:21:04,880
yes are you also considering for m2

1530
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:08,450
interface in typing no mmm

1531
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:10,790
go back to the URL see so country 2005 0

1532
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:14,139
1 you find the three types of redundant

1533
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:16,670
a transfer and first one is this one

1534
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:19,400
redundant use a frame pass using the two

1535
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:22,690
our connectivity and as you can see from

1536
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:26,120
this diagram so you establish a two

1537
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:27,530
redundant video session and to the data

1538
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:31,099
network peers

1539
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:34,809
master master hang and the PFR and

1540
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:39,710
of be at the stamp around and ups to and

1541
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:42,890
as for the up ringside communication you

1542
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:45,350
II just replicate the pocket and the

1543
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:48,980
send this kind is duplicated pocket to

1544
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:52,480
the Becerra and stand wider and has were

1545
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:58,879
wrong and UPF long and UPF just

1546
01:21:52,480 --> 01:22:02,750
transfers the incoming packet and say a

1547
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:05,210
same in same way as a noble impede PD

1548
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:11,360
and sorry no normal use a prank or great

1549
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:14,360
body and in this case is so by using

1550
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:19,190
such kind of redundant it's also if

1551
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:22,519
there is issue or the pocket rolls at

1552
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:25,099
user brain path break between the master

1553
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:29,480
rank and data network so this data

1554
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:35,420
network can receive a URL AC services

1555
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:37,940
pocket we had done that ups to and as

1556
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:40,340
for the downing side communications same

1557
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:43,879
procedure will happen and the data map

1558
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:46,040
it went data network we will replication

1559
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:51,940
and there were so youi will do the

1560
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:54,080
elimination and the second one is that

1561
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:57,290
redundant user point transmission with

1562
01:22:54,080 --> 01:23:01,400
two ns a tornado tunnels in this case

1563
01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:04,850
there is no mean DV independent run and

1564
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:08,540
UPF no and there is a two and three Tony

1565
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:13,970
Tony 1:22 between them and you if knows

1566
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:17,300
and also the up inside communication so

1567
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:19,820
down Oh Gino to be just be precast in

1568
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,830
kind pocket from you II and send this

1569
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:23,389
the brocaded package choose any suit

1570
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:26,180
only one and su-22

1571
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:30,470
and after the UPF received such this

1572
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:32,780
pocket and UPF will eliminate the tunnel

1573
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:36,290
pocket and sender pocket choose data

1574
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:39,110
network via NECN six interfaces so in

1575
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:43,100
this case is if there is pocket doors

1576
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:44,679
and transport network pass for example

1577
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:47,110
in 321

1578
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:50,949
we can continue the you are irresistible

1579
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:54,749
ease by using the answer eternal to but

1580
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:57,518
of course we need to provide disjoint

1581
01:23:54,749 --> 01:24:03,099
transport network paths for each answer

1582
01:23:57,519 --> 01:24:05,530
eternal and respond that's why I

1583
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:08,619
inserted under user is a praying

1584
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:14,139
transmission with two intermediate ups

1585
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:15,969
and n39 Tonio so in this case is as for

1586
01:24:14,139 --> 01:24:17,860
the replication animation procedures

1587
01:24:15,969 --> 01:24:22,929
there is no different from the previous

1588
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:26,860
one but there is that in 2d tandem

1589
01:24:22,929 --> 01:24:33,179
intermediate UPF one if if two pi pots

1590
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:36,489
difficut two and so in this case for the

1591
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:39,309
communication so Donna G not being no

1592
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:42,329
just the precursor incoming pocket from

1593
01:24:39,309 --> 01:24:45,989
Yui and send this pocket to the

1594
01:24:42,329 --> 01:24:50,070
intermediate up1 it immediately ps2 and

1595
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:53,438
as for the intermediate UPF it just

1596
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:57,478
receives it and pocket from govt and

1597
01:24:53,439 --> 01:25:04,900
just for was a video session Caillou VF

1598
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:07,389
and at the summary of the URL C so we we

1599
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:10,119
summarized such kind of three three kind

1600
01:25:07,389 --> 01:25:12,039
of redundant transfer in the

1601
01:25:10,119 --> 01:25:19,058
architectural requirements section in

1602
01:25:12,039 --> 01:25:23,349
this version so as for that variation

1603
01:25:19,059 --> 01:25:26,019
inspect so to support such kind of lead

1604
01:25:23,349 --> 01:25:28,510
under data transfer so use a frame

1605
01:25:26,019 --> 01:25:31,320
through the colony to support need to

1606
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:35,559
indicate a sequence number on the

1607
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:38,170
replicated pocket so in order to in

1608
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:41,860
order to distinguish this if we get

1609
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:46,780
pocket at the receiver side so in this

1610
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:48,539
and as was the gtp you country is a 3gpp

1611
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:53,018
considered to use

1612
01:25:48,539 --> 01:25:56,530
gtp sequence number field which is will

1613
01:25:53,019 --> 01:25:58,450
be encoded in basic CPU header and in

1614
01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:02,440
this example case you

1615
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:04,510
PF without a duplicated video duplicate

1616
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,339
the income pocket from Datanet work and

1617
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:08,350
attach the same sequence now but this

1618
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:14,380
case in case number one sequence number

1619
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:17,320
one and saint-jean of the B and also I

1620
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:22,120
think this is a complete complicated

1621
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:26,230
scenario but in case of the sad sad one

1622
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:30,400
we have another consideration so in this

1623
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:32,769
case is that the synthesize there's no

1624
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,089
difference from previous one but there

1625
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:38,650
is another consideration of the

1626
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:41,830
intermediate UPF so so in case you

1627
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:44,679
thought video session on Caillou PS and

1628
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:50,500
same duplicated pocket with the same

1629
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:54,040
sequence number and also so yes must

1630
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:58,240
transparent refers IP packet with same G

1631
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:00,400
if you never choose that gob this is the

1632
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:03,130
Cochino the me must distinguish the

1633
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:07,599
repeatedly placated IP flow for 30

1634
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:10,660
minutes process so at the summary of a

1635
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:13,780
variation a spectrum that you are energy

1636
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:16,630
so candidate can yet use a plane

1637
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:19,920
protocol need to support a sequence

1638
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:22,450
number and also need to support a trance

1639
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:27,790
transparently the sequence not flooding

1640
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:30,910
in case of the intermediate UPF ok so

1641
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:33,990
state doesn't exist so we added a URL c

1642
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:39,010
and we update it a PSAP on this version

1643
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:41,290
so if there is another 16 based

1644
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:44,470
re feature which is related to use of

1645
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:47,620
praying free let us know ok tough a

1646
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:53,020
question comments good question

1647
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:56,160
verification system yeah these sequence

1648
01:27:53,020 --> 01:28:00,040
number are they already are they already

1649
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:02,500
standardized or is it a proposal is I

1650
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:09,300
think this is thunder in the 23.5 the

1651
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:09,300
warm but what are the sorry oh yeah

1652
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:22,980
let me follow up on this is the still

1653
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:26,980
architecture government only knows

1654
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:30,519
stages step I know still a steady item

1655
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:51,250
right so the sequence number at this

1656
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:56,710
point isn't ugly thank you any other

1657
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:58,300
questions thank you I think is the

1658
01:28:56,710 --> 01:29:00,430
interesting topic working group yeah

1659
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:02,620
please provide any feedback on this in

1660
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:05,489
the mailer thank you and the next is

1661
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:05,489
more College

1662
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:36,740
you should yeah yeah yeah so this is not

1663
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:39,400
yeah what garden walk so this is about a

1664
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:42,410
draft that we discussed twice during

1665
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:45,250
idf's and also between and this time we

1666
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:48,080
just want to preview a little bit about

1667
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:50,480
what we which kind of activities we do

1668
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,940
around this this work and all my

1669
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:57,459
interest is to apply it to edge

1670
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:57,460
computing for for automotive use cases

1671
01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:03,349
right so very briefly about the

1672
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:05,360
background you to not steal and repeat

1673
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:09,530
what we see you time and repeat what we

1674
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:11,630
discuss already so if we look at the

1675
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:14,690
end-to-end communication between you

1676
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:18,680
ease which can go beyond mobile phones

1677
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:20,900
and services running in a cloud there is

1678
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,570
a 3gpp architecture which has the

1679
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:25,670
control plane and user plane functions

1680
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:26,870
which can work as such an anchor we

1681
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:31,550
discussed at the beginning of the

1682
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:33,140
session and other UPS which can use be

1683
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:35,570
used for uplink classification and

1684
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:38,090
traffic offload so on this particular

1685
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:40,099
interface there is a lot of work being

1686
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:42,830
done in this caste that's related to the

1687
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:46,510
study in 3gpp and so Teru did a lot of

1688
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:49,220
work here to discuss alternatives to GDP

1689
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:52,090
what we are focusing on here is an

1690
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:56,420
interface which is not really considered

1691
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:59,120
in in 3gpp because it just assumes plane

1692
01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:01,610
PDI roarings so this is the n6 interface

1693
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,920
between the previous session anchor and

1694
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:08,179
the actual service so what we want to do

1695
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:11,900
is really have an able flexible peering

1696
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:14,420
of a service and the associated video

1697
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:17,540
session anchor for a mobile device and

1698
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:20,480
second to apply policy enforcement

1699
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:23,269
points and associated control to this n6

1700
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,740
interface to have full control on the

1701
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:27,020
steering of the traffic between

1702
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:33,490
obsession anchor and the Associated

1703
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:34,699
service so to focus on this use case for

1704
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:36,769
some

1705
01:31:34,699 --> 01:31:41,480
because or you is let's call them you

1706
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:44,060
ease we may have to move services closer

1707
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:47,349
to the vehicle itself so this is mobile

1708
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:49,910
edge computing kind of directions and

1709
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:52,460
since the Mobile's are attached to a

1710
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:55,370
cellular architecture also these

1711
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:57,920
vehicles need to have a UPF serving as

1712
01:31:55,370 --> 01:32:02,059
previous session anchor or local

1713
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:05,150
breakout point configured so in this

1714
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:07,820
example we have a UPF which relays

1715
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:10,250
traffic to the vehicle from a central

1716
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:12,920
cloud but also from an edge cloud here

1717
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:14,360
so in some cases in particular if we

1718
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:17,719
want to maintain low latency

1719
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:19,360
communication we have mobility probably

1720
01:32:17,719 --> 01:32:22,610
high speed mobility if we talk about

1721
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:25,639
highway roads where cars are moving so

1722
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:28,670
we may need to relocate also the edge

1723
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:30,980
cloud second we also need to relocate

1724
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:34,000
the Associated UPF for efficiency

1725
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:38,120
reasons if we do that we deviate from

1726
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:41,270
the plain routing rules if we want to

1727
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:44,570
maintain the u.s. IP address so in that

1728
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:46,730
case we apply the concept that we

1729
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:50,570
described in the graph which is

1730
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:52,549
basically having policy enforcement

1731
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:55,219
point on the two ends of the n6

1732
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:57,469
interface and control them in a way that

1733
01:32:55,219 --> 01:33:00,530
we have unambitious traffic routing

1734
01:32:57,469 --> 01:33:04,790
between the old or the new anchor and

1735
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:06,139
the associated services so the scope of

1736
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:08,780
this draft

1737
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:11,890
first of all describes the use case in

1738
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:17,540
the operational aspects second we

1739
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:20,270
propose how such data plane overlay on

1740
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:23,330
the n6 interface can be integrated and

1741
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:25,520
aligned with policies in the 5g control

1742
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:27,920
plane because the UPF is under control

1743
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:30,020
of the cellular control plane and then

1744
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:33,170
six we want to have additional

1745
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:37,670
controllers to enforce the the routing

1746
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:40,340
policies here so in this draft we want

1747
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:42,080
to look mainly at some architectural and

1748
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:44,660
operational aspects and then define the

1749
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:47,059
data models that are required on this

1750
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:48,440
interface between the controller and the

1751
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:50,239
data plane note

1752
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:52,099
second between the controller and the 5g

1753
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:55,400
control plane as you can see you will

1754
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:58,250
leverage a standard 3gpp function which

1755
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:00,849
is the application function as a binding

1756
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:05,210
element between the 5g control plane and

1757
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:09,920
the n6 state opening so one of the key

1758
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:12,890
concepts is that we consider two types

1759
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,930
of deployments here so I said we need

1760
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:17,030
policy enforcement points for traffic

1761
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:21,320
steering on the two ends of the n6

1762
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:24,679
interface so one is always aligned with

1763
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:26,660
the data network so we have here which

1764
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:29,719
can receive and enforce policies for

1765
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:33,410
traffic treatment on the other sent side

1766
01:34:29,719 --> 01:34:37,040
we have two options so the UPF may

1767
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:39,380
receive the upstream traffic treatment

1768
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:42,170
policies directly from the mobile core

1769
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:45,170
we are the n4 interface that's what we

1770
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:47,570
call tight coupling currently we'll look

1771
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:50,780
more at the loose coupling options for M

1772
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:55,190
EC which you can see later why we do

1773
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:57,440
that and here basically we keep the n6

1774
01:34:55,190 --> 01:35:00,139
traffic treatment policies and the

1775
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:04,549
associated control independent of the

1776
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:07,820
mobile core which has some advantages so

1777
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:10,070
the status of this work is that we

1778
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:14,150
started to discuss concepts with some of

1779
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:17,660
you before ITF 103 and before we

1780
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:19,099
continued with that on ITF 104 and we

1781
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:21,019
received interest in valuable feedback

1782
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:25,670
which has been taken into account in the

1783
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:27,620
current version of the draft so the

1784
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:30,410
latest update was unfortunately only

1785
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:33,349
before I kiev 104 so we described

1786
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:34,969
operational aspects we support the two

1787
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:38,989
different and describe the two different

1788
01:35:34,969 --> 01:35:41,150
options loose coupling company and we

1789
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:44,419
need to put a bit more energy into

1790
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:49,699
elaboration of the mature information

1791
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:51,620
model um as we said during the last ITF

1792
01:35:49,699 --> 01:35:53,929
meeting we wanted to have an update of

1793
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:56,110
the draft with a little bit of a brush

1794
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:57,949
content because we have a lot of

1795
01:35:56,110 --> 01:36:00,170
description in so we want to clean up

1796
01:35:57,949 --> 01:36:01,559
that and drive the modeling and

1797
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:04,320
operational aspect

1798
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:06,420
description but ahead unfortunately we

1799
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:09,150
could not do that so we don't have an

1800
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:13,170
updated draft but our current focus is

1801
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:15,210
more looking into the various aspects of

1802
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:17,730
the food system so that includes Etsy

1803
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:24,000
MEC architecture related stuff as well

1804
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:25,740
as 3gpp related interactions so secondly

1805
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,050
we focus more on experimental

1806
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:29,760
prototyping to learn where our

1807
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:32,550
additional gaps and where we probably

1808
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,500
have more things to specify and also

1809
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:37,380
have options for standard contributions

1810
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,180
so one of the options or one of the

1811
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:42,120
tracks here is that we contributed some

1812
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:43,560
of these aspects to Etsy Mac and in

1813
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:46,280
particular the loose coupling approach

1814
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:49,740
has been discussed and and value their

1815
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:53,519
us but not least for the prototyping and

1816
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:58,040
and trialing so POC related activities

1817
01:36:53,520 --> 01:37:01,380
we currently do in one of three European

1818
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:03,900
Commission granted automotive corridor

1819
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:05,610
projects which is called 5g Carmen if

1820
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:07,670
you want to have a look to that one or

1821
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:14,469
talk to me later about the project

1822
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:16,790
pieces so very briefly so as you can see

1823
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:20,940
[Music]

1824
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:24,330
the red part or the orange part is

1825
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:26,009
mobile pink all related functions so we

1826
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:28,260
have the mobile Co control plane the

1827
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:30,450
user play function and the application

1828
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:33,570
function which in that case we deploy on

1829
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:35,610
a Mac platform manager which is part of

1830
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:38,750
the green part so we integrate basically

1831
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:41,580
the Mac platform manager mainly to

1832
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:44,580
access the traffic treatment policies on

1833
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:47,970
the Mac platform where the applications

1834
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:50,460
are running on top of it so this is as

1835
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:52,770
you can identify the n6 interface

1836
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:54,780
between UPF and the actual service and

1837
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:58,590
this is what we want to have control so

1838
01:37:54,780 --> 01:38:01,380
in that case it's a local scenario where

1839
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:03,420
for example the relocation of an

1840
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:05,550
application in the Mac platform is

1841
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:07,950
required for load balancing or failure

1842
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:10,650
reasons so that's a problem statement

1843
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:12,750
that came up in its emag and this is

1844
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:15,299
what we can use as a solution here to

1845
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:17,310
really relocate the epic

1846
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:20,490
into a different platform and steer the

1847
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:24,360
traffic using the to policy enforcement

1848
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:27,210
points accordingly more interestingly

1849
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:33,540
for the week the scenario is if we have

1850
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:40,680
a moving car you have a question on the

1851
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:43,440
previous page if you have a networking

1852
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:46,400
between the application server and the

1853
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:53,960
UPF are you covering the scenario where

1854
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:58,620
it's a non topological route to that UPS

1855
01:38:53,960 --> 01:39:00,600
so if I understood the question right

1856
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:02,250
this is this is exactly the point why we

1857
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:06,840
need the policy enforcement point

1858
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:08,700
because if we move any any of the two

1859
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:11,670
end points either on the application

1860
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:14,849
side which is this case or on the UPF

1861
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:17,850
side which is the next case we deviate

1862
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:19,860
from standard routes so we need host

1863
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:23,940
routes which we enforce then on these

1864
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:25,679
two points here this is done by the

1865
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:30,419
policy controllers according to the

1866
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:33,090
scenarios that we described so this is

1867
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:35,310
basically the case which we show in

1868
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:37,350
three slides that the car moves from the

1869
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:40,230
left and right and at some point in time

1870
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:44,070
you may take a decision to relocate also

1871
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:47,009
the edge serving the the vehicle so as

1872
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:49,349
you see here that's a starting point the

1873
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:52,290
vehicle has a UPF assigned from the

1874
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:55,020
cellular network and traffic is routed

1875
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:59,060
on the n6 interface to the v2x

1876
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:59,060
application running on the platform here

1877
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:04,710
this is basically the end scenario we

1878
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:06,389
are on the right side and in the end we

1879
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:10,350
want to continue serving the vehicle

1880
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:14,340
from a new max site the we could got a

1881
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:16,950
new UPF here and the tracks application

1882
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:19,320
also has been relocated in between we

1883
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:24,290
try to leverage that DP and overlay on +

1884
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:28,769
6 for this inter site scenario to

1885
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:30,390
basically keep that kind of procedure as

1886
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:31,890
much as possible independent of the 5g

1887
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:36,950
control plane there are scenarios

1888
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:40,380
discussed in 3gpp 4 I think it's part of

1889
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:43,220
ultra low latency kind of study and

1890
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:46,410
description so here they play a lot with

1891
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:48,900
UPF serving as anchor nodes as uplink

1892
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:51,660
classifiers and in between they

1893
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:53,099
configure a lot these UPF stood erect

1894
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:57,090
traffic to the new site

1895
01:40:53,100 --> 01:41:00,210
so here 3 TPP so it's pretty much

1896
01:40:57,090 --> 01:41:03,450
relaxed by just adding in another UPF

1897
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:06,840
which can hopefully serve the same you

1898
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:09,000
IP address and all the relaying we do on

1899
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:11,460
the VPN overlay here so that's something

1900
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,130
what we investigate how far this is

1901
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:15,840
possible for intradomain but also for

1902
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:19,110
inter domain because the mentioned

1903
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:22,440
project like 50 Carmen they take a lot

1904
01:41:19,110 --> 01:41:26,009
of interest in cross-border scenarios

1905
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:30,389
which implies into operator and over so

1906
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:32,790
there are a lot of technology issues and

1907
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:36,210
challenges underneath for inter pyramid

1908
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:39,030
over which is not optimally deployed

1909
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:41,490
today but this is something we treat a

1910
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:43,800
complementary so whatever we can do on

1911
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:45,809
the n6 interface to support that kind of

1912
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,390
relocation that's something we want to

1913
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:52,230
investigate

1914
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:55,350
so forwarding between the two dpns on

1915
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:57,599
top of the UPF s-- here we can apply a

1916
01:41:55,350 --> 01:42:00,240
segment roaring low calorie right or

1917
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,940
even tunnels and that's something we

1918
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:06,420
want to configure then dynamically in

1919
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:09,179
alignment with the mobile core decisions

1920
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:11,400
for example if the mobile core decides

1921
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:14,310
on which UPF to use in the target

1922
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:16,160
network and associated loop loosely

1923
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:18,240
coupled EP any to be selected and the

1924
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:22,559
traffic treatment policies need to be

1925
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:24,360
enforced one last picture here so for

1926
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:31,640
that kind of deployment in particular if

1927
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:35,969
we talk about cross domain handover and

1928
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:37,680
edge relocation so in the solution we

1929
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:41,760
are investigating we involve an

1930
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:42,690
orchestration layer because here its

1931
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,670
advantages

1932
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:48,809
if you can anticipate that such a

1933
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:51,300
movement is ahead so you can for example

1934
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:53,160
derive this from the movement pattern

1935
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:55,920
and the directions of the vehicle and

1936
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:58,800
then anticipate which network is the

1937
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:01,440
best to serve the vehicle in the next

1938
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,420
one two minutes and then prepare

1939
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:05,759
resources in advance through to optimize

1940
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:08,930
that kind of process so here we move the

1941
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:11,699
orchestration layer and that's also

1942
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:14,280
taking relevant standardization effort

1943
01:43:11,699 --> 01:43:17,549
in Etsy and if we into account because

1944
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:19,800
they look at the inter domain interfaces

1945
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:21,150
between distributed orchestrators so

1946
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:25,610
that's the full system we currently

1947
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:28,379
investigate the ITF part is more on

1948
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:31,339
let's say the control plane to the data

1949
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:33,810
plane that kind of interface where we

1950
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:36,690
today discuss and refer to the FPC

1951
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:38,910
document or PF CP could also be used

1952
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:41,639
here and on the other hand between the

1953
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:44,489
AF the application function and the

1954
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:47,640
mobile core which is semantic which may

1955
01:43:44,489 --> 01:43:49,230
be contributed into 3gpp later so that's

1956
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:51,930
something we would like to describe in

1957
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:54,690
the draft and if these scenarios and

1958
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:57,000
deployments are some of interest to you

1959
01:43:54,690 --> 01:44:02,370
we would appreciate having more people

1960
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:04,290
to discuss with jon-jon question for

1961
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:07,320
clarification you mentioned about

1962
01:44:04,290 --> 01:44:11,489
optimizing and predicting normals so

1963
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:15,000
that the policy can be noted is that I

1964
01:44:11,489 --> 01:44:17,790
mean as considering the day latency

1965
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,699
issue because in some sense the policy

1966
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:24,290
is being handled by the control plane or

1967
01:44:20,699 --> 01:44:29,009
management plane and the traffic is a

1968
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:33,060
thousand times faster yes so is that is

1969
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:34,920
predicting the path the solution to that

1970
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:40,680
latency problem or are you looking at

1971
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:43,110
other approaches so here we rather look

1972
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:45,360
at proactive mechanisms than reactive

1973
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:47,730
ones so a sooner or as much as

1974
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:50,880
productive you can be it helps in

1975
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:54,570
reducing that kind of latency so if you

1976
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:56,469
can select a target before and at least

1977
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:59,710
some of the resources you can

1978
01:44:56,469 --> 01:45:03,130
some states you cannot set up in advance

1979
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:05,410
for example as soon well if you don't

1980
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:08,620
know which access point or you know be

1981
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:10,360
the the vehicle will attach to so that's

1982
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:13,809
one of the last steps in our scenario

1983
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:16,690
that we have to consider but we can

1984
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:19,810
prepare the resources on my platform we

1985
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:22,120
can prepare a selection of UPF and DPN

1986
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:24,130
in advance and that's something we

1987
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:26,110
currently look at so Marco is there

1988
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:28,480
predicting the path based on historical

1989
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:31,469
data or some mobility patterns or what

1990
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:33,759
exactly so for that prediction scheme

1991
01:45:31,469 --> 01:45:39,090
various things are possible and that's

1992
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:43,570
to be investigated okay thanks all right

1993
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:46,150
next similar to to last time we still

1994
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:48,330
need to revise the document to focus a

1995
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:50,889
little bit more on the actual scope and

1996
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:52,930
converge and suitable notation for the

1997
01:45:50,890 --> 01:45:54,940
first operational aspects and also for

1998
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:57,880
the semantics and the information models

1999
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:59,919
we want to describe yeah still we target

2000
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,310
a draft update and if you have comments

2001
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:05,560
to improve that draft we appreciate and

2002
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:09,420
I said we already have associated

2003
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:11,620
contributions in ANSI Mac here and

2004
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:14,590
interested in adopting this work I think

2005
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:16,180
we can postpone to to a later point I'm

2006
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:18,160
dependent on your feedback and the

2007
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:24,040
interest to progress this document in

2008
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:25,809
DML okay all right so I think I'm really

2009
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,580
at this point you're looking for

2010
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:30,040
feedback from working group right mark

2011
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:32,590
we are not asking for any action from a

2012
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:34,719
select no but if you have comments or

2013
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:36,250
are interested in more details and open

2014
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,940
for discussion we would appreciate that

2015
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:38,830
okay

2016
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:41,610
all right yeah I I tend to think this is

2017
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:43,449
a very very good work I hope you know

2018
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:47,860
let's see how it goes

2019
01:46:43,449 --> 01:46:52,110
yeah Thank You Marco any any final

2020
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:55,360
questions okay we have two more

2021
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:57,610
presentations that were both for Charlie

2022
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:00,969
Perkins but unfortunately last minute II

2023
01:46:57,610 --> 01:47:03,400
here to do is cancellation so I think we

2024
01:47:00,969 --> 01:47:07,929
already discussed about the yang okay

2025
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:10,230
all right on the FPC also right so there

2026
01:47:07,929 --> 01:47:10,230
are no

2027
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:18,530
so do the song okay so that's nothing

2028
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:20,300
else this is it there's a closure of the

2029
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:23,840
meeting thank you everyone Thanks

2030
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:27,920
if you did everybody sign the blue

2031
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:30,530
sheets if not please coming here sign

2032
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:33,010
the sheets thank you so much meeting is

2033
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:33,009
now closed

2034
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:48,180
