9
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:24,049

always appreciated by minute takers all

23
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:21,560
right so milestones so administrative oh

24
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,159
we just did that okay milestones would

25
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,620
you like to run through that sure all

26
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,798
right so we have we're beating our work

27
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,879
on the on use case document that's not

28
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,900
going to be we made a decision or a

29
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,810
virtual interim that we would not

30
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,799
publish the as an RFC but it should be

31
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,769
available for for publicly for for

32
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,169
review we did call for an adoption on

33
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:51,049
the e draft and that adoption was

34
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:53,569
accepted we have a call for adoption for

35
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,329
the token vine draft the interaction

36
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,689
model draft yang module draft and the to

37
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,689
to draft

38
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:07,250
okay so we're working on we're working

39
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:13,359
on making a call for those adoption call

40
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:15,500
for those drafts in july 2019 we did the

41
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:18,590
comfort option for the architecture

42
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,340
draft that actually was delayed so we

43
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:26,810
anticipate making a call for that the

44
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:31,099
draft in this meeting right or the next

45
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,820
meeting tomorrow so we're gonna be

46
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,620
making a day

47
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,960
change for these ones that were supposed

48
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,200
to happen in March and then the ad will

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,900
accept one that date so we'll be

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,860
updating will be updating the milestones

51
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,419
accordingly so if we can stay on track

52
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,490
we're gonna ask the question tomorrow

53
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,430
after the updates for both the

54
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,150
architecture and the yang module whether

55
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,190
there's been you know viewers to allow

56
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,979
us to put the question of whether it's

57
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:09,950
ready to put the call for adoption so

58
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:15,620
we'll be updating milestones sorry okay

59
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:17,690
so do we need to talk about the parts

60
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,870
2020 stuff no yeah I think we're done

61
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,930
there yeah we're still on track yeah

62
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:31,720
okay okay

63
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:31,720
sorry you're on track okay so next

64
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:52,010
slightly the same thing okay so that's

65
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:54,950
today I think okay so this is our agenda

66
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:59,360
yeah all right so that was our no so the

67
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,700
next up is ten minutes for I'm sorry

68
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:12,380
about 20 minutes for use cases so

69
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:19,820
Michael Richardson too many of us up

70
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:23,020
here chair task allocation well this is

71
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,700
the magic you have to click three times

72
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,609
to make sure it's in full screen ability

73
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:38,510
to say no please like know exactly oh I

74
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:41,060
forgot my Ruby me too there we go

75
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,409
no it works you should turn it off the

76
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,000
end of the session so that people at

77
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,800
home don't hear what you say to the

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,840
chairs quietly hi I'm Michael Richardson

79
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,690
we'll be talking about the use case

80
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,310
documents a day or rather you will be

81
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,760
talking about the use case document

82
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:02,090
today I really hope says oh three that's

83
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,280
excuse me and that's correct I

84
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,799
anticipated posting in you and yesterday

85
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,280
but my little more aspirational than

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,040
active what are we doing today

87
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,900
how we got here where are we going can I

88
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:21,590
raise it show hands of those who were at

89
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:23,810
the intro interim so I would say 20% of

90
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,280
the rooms that look about right so for a

91
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,460
lot of you this will be new and I think

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,950
that's okay and we got where are we

93
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,380
going where are we where is it going I

94
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,060
would like to spend the most the bulk of

95
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,169
the time the discussion we have only one

96
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,520
microphone that's okay I guess and then

97
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,109
after the sort of after discussion I'd

98
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,030
like to share what I actually in my

99
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,840
vision is how it's going to mutate into

100
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,960
what it will look like okay if we get

101
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,539
there so there's an initial zero zero

102
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,390
zero one zero three posts district of

103
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,580
the ritual interim I imagine posting in

104
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,469
Oh for yesterday actually there wasn't

105
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,310
enough material that i fairly felt it

106
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,979
was worth the integer and it's as tired

107
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,990
okay so as we'd agree the intention is

108
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,150
this is not published as an RFC partly

109
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,250
because the iesg doesn't really feel

110
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,789
that we should publish requirements and

111
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,320
use case documents on their own if this

112
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,810
working group really really thinks that

113
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,550
the content is valuable then I would

114
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,990
urge you to put it in as an appendix to

115
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,330
some other document that's going to be

116
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,540
it published anyway I'm not looking from

117
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:33,110
our author credits so I don't care

118
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:37,669
the goal is to focus us on what's

119
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:40,070
important and what's not I'm well in

120
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,468
continuing so the document so far there

121
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,060
are 13 use cases listed I hope they're

122
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,010
in better order than they were at the

123
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,060
last meeting there's approximately four

124
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,030
categories

125
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,790
device capabilities our firmware state

126
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,390
claims cryptographic key claims so the

127
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,050
distinguished

128
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,310
is ima devices a foo I'm running

129
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,250
firmware blah blah blah and the

130
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,199
cryptographic keys things are more like

131
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,480
this key has been stored in a particular

132
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,930
type of container or TPM or something

133
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,120
and that's why you can trust it or not

134
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,000
Geographic is in location where are

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,400
things where it things connectivity

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,470
which is a little bit like geographic in

137
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,740
a more abstract sense I'm you know

138
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,200
connected to something or whatever

139
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,720
includes a survey have identified

140
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,730
technology users so this list could

141
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,470
increase trust the computer group

142
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,540
computing group has said they wanted to

143
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,720
use this phyto says they wanted use this

144
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,069
and Android key start has been expressed

145
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,990
as being a thing and I know we have

146
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,500
people from there though I can't quite

147
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,930
figure out yet how that's going to work

148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,350
Carl Wallace contributed three big

149
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,079
examples of existing attestation claims

150
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,680
down to the asn.1 decode in this kind of

151
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,570
stuff I found it fascinating I have as

152
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,439
many questions as answers about what I

153
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:03,110
saw in there and I don't know whether or

154
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,270
not it's useful in this for us to do

155
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,400
this kind of thing at this level it may

156
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,890
be that at a smaller level of

157
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,439
abstraction it's useful to see what

158
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,770
people have done or maybe we just need

159
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,750
more text to less hex dump to really say

160
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,750
something interesting yes roman

161
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,910
expressed interest to use this did you

162
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,430
mean the protocol that ultimately

163
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,050
developed or did you need that they

164
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,969
actually want that use case document

165
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,140
because i know we kind of talked oh no I

166
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,760
don't think they care I don't know if

167
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,680
they care about you stick case document

168
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,630
although I think I've heard from people

169
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,109
from all of those places about use cases

170
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,180
so that that's a good point

171
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,400
the that while our Charter says I was

172
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,650
actually rather surprised to say that

173
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,569
realized the Charter does include a

174
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,060
protocol in the end because I thought we

175
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,300
were trying to not have a protocol but

176
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,250
just have a claims format because most

177
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,900
of these people do have protocols maybe

178
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,320
not Android keystore but the other two

179
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,970
certainly have protocol

180
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,140
that pre-existing and they just want to

181
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:16,110
have standardized ways of expressing

182
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:18,390
claims not publish if one of those

183
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,980
entities were to express that this would

184
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,860
be important in laws that would probably

185
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,330
change yeah so no objection to doing it

186
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,710
what I'm trying to say is that that

187
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,000
don't think of this oh my goodness how

188
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,980
are we going to publish this think of it

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,370
as what is this dot how does this

190
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,780
document help us focus our thinking not

191
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,100
how does it work

192
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:40,439
yes so like sorry if I can interject so

193
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,420
Roman we discussed this just some links

194
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,490
at the virtual interim and we decided to

195
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,430
table the publication that it was more

196
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,240
important to get the use cases to help

197
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,920
drive the motivation for the solution I

198
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,760
think in terms of the tempo that is

199
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,760
that's phenomenal

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,000
just a thank you for these you've got

201
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,390
your skates drafted it's already covered

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,400
a lot awful night nation's technology

203
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,890
and the industry I just the one who at

204
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:16,560
one point that are maybe one years ago

205
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:20,449
we have education use case draft about

206
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,949
the technology network network

207
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,730
organization technology oh yes all right

208
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:29,670
so I'm wondering with our consider it

209
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:36,420
can also be a part of this document so

210
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:38,459
if we can consider it so it's a network

211
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,290
virtualization obviously if we I haven't

212
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,900
read the document right the instant I

213
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,550
think the answer is that we need to post

214
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,250
the relevant pieces to the mailing list

215
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:51,329
and abstract what is the use case that's

216
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,700
occurring and a lot of a lot of people

217
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,970
thing and I want to attest over the

218
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,620
network as to a particular aspect of the

219
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:02,910
device and say so that's a device

220
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,620
attestation use case and so the question

221
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,050
is is there something unique about the

222
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,340
particular environment there so in some

223
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,400
cases people said oh yes there's no

224
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,870
every party is a relying party because

225
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,880
it's peer to peer and then there's some

226
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,950
other other variations that people said

227
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,000
so I think certainly welcome Frank it it

228
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,010
would be

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,410
I am interested in feedback as to the

230
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,819
utility the examples I think that maybe

231
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:30,209
less detail about the examples would be

232
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,850
it was probably warranted I kind of just

233
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,770
Karl and he's not here this week send me

234
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:39,010
a pull request so it was really easy to

235
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,329
just suck it all in without thinking and

236
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,220
I went wow there's a lot of really

237
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,290
interesting stuff here I don't really

238
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,730
think that that it we all of it belongs

239
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,770
but I actually think that it's kind of

240
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,750
useful for people to see prior art and

241
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,430
what happened and what kind of things

242
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,290
were there but I think we need more

243
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,209
explanation of some things or maybe just

244
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,380
references to where these things are

245
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,630
defined so I think that would be very

246
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:05,700
welcome yeah if you have something else

247
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:08,560
okay many from etsi they have some

248
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:12,940
possibility documentation about it they

249
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,329
need this kind of was a what a nice girl

250
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,330
network and indeed there are some

251
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:22,000
specific or technology or technology be

252
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,610
common for that for those skills case so

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,100
I think from wither from the common and

254
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,350
the founders technology aspect you so

255
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,170
maybe back to of cases we should either

256
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,840
so okay yeah so so please we can discuss

257
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,250
more so so my intention is to do a

258
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:41,410
little bit and then have I was whole

259
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:44,020
slide for open mic so yes in general I

260
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,390
would like people to express the use

261
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,579
case and say I think I have a use case

262
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,470
as you've just said and then you know

263
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,030
said okay that's great please let's

264
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,480
figure out how it fits into the rest of

265
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:57,339
the thing where is it going so first

266
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,140
point is we want to add new use cases

267
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,670
there's been one pointed post to the

268
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,949
mailing list I think it was Monday or

269
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,729
Sunday by dr. Ian Oliver maybe you're

270
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,530
here I don't know about three new terms

271
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,820
at least with supply chain dynamic

272
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,439
systems and data there was some

273
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,050
discussion of it so whether some of this

274
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,050
belonged or not and I think that's all

275
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:21,910
appropriate my goal is to accept the

276
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:24,040
text okay make sure to take clarifying

277
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,140
questions about the text do you mean it

278
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,420
refers to when the oranges are in the

279
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,590
container or when the oranges are in the

280
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,469
store okay whatever if it's a photo

281
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:36,620
just and clarify that so that we have

282
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,620
some agreement as to what is the case

283
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,070
that's being described and then I want

284
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,360
to argue about is this different from

285
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,970
something else so do you see the

286
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,890
two-step process here remember we have

287
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,870
that meeting where people ask for

288
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,920
clarification questions only and clearly

289
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,910
people weren't clear on what

290
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,800
clarifications were all right so so I

291
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,189
really do want that step on the mailing

292
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,829
list

293
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:03,410
to do that because before you start

294
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,440
disagreeing with it you probably have

295
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:09,110
made some assumptions about what's going

296
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,410
on that may be or may not be true and so

297
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,700
the idea is we really like to get a

298
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,370
unified view of it so that's the blue

299
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,630
things

300
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,970
Jessica Fitzgerald McKay who I saw in

301
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,640
the back somewhere there has suggested a

302
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,160
different set of dimensions and I tried

303
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,530
hard to understand at 10 o'clock on

304
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,600
Monday night what that really meant and

305
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,089
I actually I failed to understand the

306
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,660
the list so I did not could challenge

307
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,310
you yet but but on it but I hope maybe I

308
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,850
got three dimensions out of what you

309
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,880
wrote and I think that's a useful

310
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,280
comment and I think that we should

311
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,730
categorize the uses cases on a number of

312
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,620
different ways but ultimately this is

313
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,470
not about making an ontology of use

314
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,540
cases okay and if you know about the

315
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,750
Platypus who I believe is a mammal that

316
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,719
has a beacon lays eggs and therefore is

317
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,790
warm-blooded but you know lays eggs the

318
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,620
question is what category confused

319
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,349
biologists first centuries right is to

320
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:11,000
wit what kind and that's not our goal my

321
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:13,189
goal is not to figure out whether this

322
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,650
use case belongs in category a or

323
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,240
category B but to understand that use

324
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,950
case and whether we have to solve it

325
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:24,470
okay so a platypus exists if it needs an

326
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,700
ecosystem to live in we need to provide

327
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,740
it and we don't need to worry about

328
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:31,390
which part of the zoo we put it in okay

329
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:34,370
if it gets its own place great okay and

330
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,530
open-mike come tell me the things that

331
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,719
you fail to find how many people have

332
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,750
read the documents since the I know dave

333
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,860
has of course yeah

334
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:49,040
it's done and just leave your hand up

335
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:50,419
okay so not that many so that that's not

336
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,250
so good because I'm hoping you'll come

337
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,450
and argue and discuss with with whether

338
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,950
the 13 items we have are useful or not

339
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,660
and we can see what was going on and do

340
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,070
you have new ones so Frank has given us

341
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,920
one new one does someone else have

342
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:07,970
things that they don't feel that have

343
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,630
been represented by them yes sir how

344
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:22,130
much time do I have

345
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:23,540
oh okay which is tomorrow it's all a lot

346
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,140
of things which were proposed to be

347
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,540
networked at the station yeah remember

348
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,000
the network based of attestations are

349
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,590
not in the use case document so the

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,480
question of are you gonna collapse

351
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,379
things from other people's documents

352
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,080
that are not necessarily exist yes and I

353
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,760
can only do that if I mean I can look

354
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,100
through the list of extra documents but

355
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,730
of course they showed up on Friday right

356
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,949
so I can't have that happen so we are

357
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:58,460
having a side meeting tomorrow morning

358
00:18:51,950 --> 00:19:00,560
at 8:30 in the corral room and the goal

359
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,160
is to put the use case document on the

360
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,350
screen

361
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:08,600
anyone have a VGA cable because I need

362
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:10,790
one and to actually stuff them in at

363
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,409
that point so that we can actually argue

364
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,680
over the text right there that's the

365
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:18,410
goal of the side meeting is to actually

366
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,640
bring that forward so if all we do is go

367
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,340
through the documents as you just

368
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,170
mentioned and and in pull the right

369
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,760
pieces out or if you're the expert on

370
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,280
that document you can say you want

371
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,870
paragraph six through nine of this thing

372
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,149
will condense it down to one paragraph

373
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,310
that would be a really useful thing to

374
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,500
get together to do okay so that's what

375
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:41,440
the goal is to make that and Rev the

376
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,440
document and you know go on okay all

377
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:49,640
right well so what I have envisioned for

378
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,169
the use case document is a series of

379
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,420
pieces like this that doesn't look like

380
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,830
this right now so there'll be a series

381
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,140
of thing

382
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:59,049
it's the name of the used case who is

383
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,440
going to use it okay what is the goal of

384
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:03,639
this if there's a list of 12:12

385
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,409
protocols or standards or something that

386
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,179
can you that will use this or make use

387
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:13,059
of this thing great who is attesting

388
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:15,370
okay what is the device or the the TPM

389
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,139
or the root of trust or something like

390
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,158
this that is making a statement

391
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,080
who is the relying party who's going to

392
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,590
verify the statement or cares about what

393
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:30,610
it says and the use case what is the

394
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,230
description okay and then if you look at

395
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,658
the eat document for instance there's a

396
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,730
whole long list of claims that it offers

397
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:38,889
right a palette of things that you may

398
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,260
say about it and so the intention is in

399
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:44,168
the use case what are the claims that

400
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,700
you're going to be making use of and so

401
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,470
in order for this to be useful this is

402
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,649
two things first of all it motivates why

403
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,179
that claim exists in the eat document

404
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:54,399
okay and that's the whole points the use

405
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:58,149
cases and secondly it could say

406
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,010
something I need to attest to the shape

407
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:03,580
of the microphone and we do not have a

408
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:06,639
claim that attests to that so that would

409
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,379
mean that there's a gap right and so we

410
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:10,269
only have 13 use cases so imagine we

411
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,529
have 20 at the end of the day and then

412
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,350
we argue about them and we end it with

413
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:16,000
17 okay that's not that many to go

414
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,490
through and say things and then we the

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,260
question is well do we have things in

416
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,260
the eat document that don't need aren't

417
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,580
needed or or are missing and I think

418
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,799
that's the whole purpose of a use case

419
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,960
document is to explain to us why where

420
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:37,870
are you doing certain things that makes

421
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:40,419
sense makes sense is a framework I just

422
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:43,178
wanted to check whether you're open to

423
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:46,320
the idea that a testing party and

424
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:50,320
relying party for a single use case

425
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,668
might be multiples there are multiple

426
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,939
testing parties and there are multiple

427
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:56,889
relying parties absolutely so you would

428
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,950
like it to have pluralization for that

429
00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:01,090
that thing yeah I don't know why I was

430
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,700
thinking about twelve Monkeys it's

431
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:07,350
interesting movie but there you go if

432
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,350
you know it you know it if not it's okay

433
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,139
there you go so says that's the the Vasa

434
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,420
T so certainly that's the case there's a

435
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:22,010
use case for computational systems

436
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:24,260
that's motivated by well blockchain

437
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,990
systems where apparently they would like

438
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,250
to have some kind of attestation that

439
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,780
the hardware they're running is real

440
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,340
hardware and is no powerful than a

441
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,530
certain thing and has not virtualized

442
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,600
and other stuff like that but one of the

443
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,310
key points is that all of the members

444
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,100
are testing and all the members are

445
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,780
relying because it's a peer-to-peer so

446
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,850
that's a lot different than other things

447
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,190
even though it's really about the the

448
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,629
the device the thing and actually I

449
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,640
don't know maybe the attesting party is

450
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:55,010
actually a third a third party that may

451
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:57,820
actually really be the case okay all

452
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,820
right well that's all I got

453
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:07,280
yes meeting is tomorrow morning Thursday

454
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:10,639
morning 8:30 caller room upstairs that

455
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:17,270
way go past the the ping room which the

456
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:30,530
iesg is in appropriately so up next is

457
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:34,270
Lawrence for the eat draught all right

458
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:40,990
hello this is my first time as a

459
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:46,460
document editor here in IETF clicker so

460
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:49,940
hopefully I understand the procedures so

461
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:52,700
here's a general comments and general

462
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,840
comments on the oh one draft that was

463
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,450
published about a month ago some this

464
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,820
was the first major revision to it since

465
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:09,200
it was draft about a year ago one of the

466
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:12,320
major shifts in this version was that an

467
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,200
8 is considered to be either a CW T or a

468
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,950
JWT it can be either and the whole

469
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,810
document Orient's around that so that

470
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,130
was a

471
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,659
there my understanding was we had

472
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,970
consensus about it and I know I know we

473
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:36,530
had consensus about it for CWT and I've

474
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:39,590
extended that to JWT so doing that now

475
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:42,920
the document inherits a lot from those

476
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,760
documents and I think this is a good

477
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,180
thing

478
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,950
simplifies things less text to write

479
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:53,120
there may be some leftover stuff in the

480
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,940
the draft from before what it wasn't but

481
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,659
we can clean clean that up anyway so

482
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:03,230
inheriting it inherits things like claim

483
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,570
optionality it inherits the verification

484
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,610
process and it inherits the Ayana

485
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,700
process and I think these are things

486
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,889
we've had some discussions about but if

487
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,750
you really look at what weirdest is I

488
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:19,910
think where it's landing and and I'm

489
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:22,750
happy about this another thing that this

490
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:27,410
document does as this version does is

491
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:31,970
defines the claims in some text plus CD

492
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:33,950
DL and then the CD DL is used to

493
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,460
basically mechanically or procedurally

494
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,040
derive that JSON or the C War for the

495
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,600
actual serialization so tomorrow we have

496
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,950
some discussion about data model versus

497
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,300
information model and how all that fits

498
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:48,380
together so I'm not going to go into

499
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:52,010
that today I'm just saying that this is

500
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,040
how the o1 draft is set up I think it's

501
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:59,360
nice to be able to have that based on

502
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:02,750
the CD DL and sort of describe the each

503
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,179
claim without going into any details of

504
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:09,080
the Jason or C port representation or

505
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,550
some other representation and that's

506
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,550
kind of becomes the core of the

507
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:19,010
definition of the claim is that that

508
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:21,409
text plus CD DL so the CD CD DL is being

509
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,810
used normatively here I'm not sure that

510
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,820
that's been done before I mean in every

511
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:28,270
everything I've seen doesn't use it

512
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,270
normatively

513
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:38,930
so yeah okay so this I think we're still

514
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:43,669
this document is still in somewhat early

515
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:47,300
stages right now there's about a dozen

516
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:50,030
issues in github I have slides for about

517
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,240
half a dozen of those too for some

518
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:57,790
discussion today I'm expecting more

519
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:01,010
issues and get up more discussion there

520
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,780
my vision of this document in terms of

521
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,730
you know how many claims do we have in

522
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,230
this document there's a set here but I'm

523
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,870
actually expecting there to be more

524
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:12,380
claims and in Prague I had some lists of

525
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,850
them and you know all that so and it was

526
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,520
nice to see how that lines up with the

527
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:19,419
use cases and that that's really being

528
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,730
considered in the use cases so I'm

529
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:27,050
interested in seeing more claims being

530
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:29,990
proposed and added to this document also

531
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,909
you know interested in it not being like

532
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,200
every claim ever in the document taking

533
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:38,120
five years because we're gonna try to do

534
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,610
every claim ever so looking for a sort

535
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,559
of a highly coherent generally useful

536
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,439
generally applicable set of claims as

537
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:51,410
that was that was my vision for what

538
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:54,200
this document would contain go ahead

539
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:57,320
Mike Mike Jones I think we're already

540
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,630
aligned on this but I'm at Microsoft

541
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:03,260
I'll state for the record that when we

542
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:07,340
developed the claims in the job and the

543
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:10,970
COTS backs yep we made it explicitly use

544
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:13,639
case driven we wanted to look for clays

545
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,590
that we believed there were existing use

546
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,950
cases that would use them immediately

547
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:22,220
and if so we put them in and otherwise

548
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:24,340
we provided registries where people

549
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:30,130
could add them later and I think that's

550
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:30,129
that's worked out well okay

551
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,790
this is saying a clarifying question so

552
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:47,159
what you're saying is we're doing it

553
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:51,270
right okay did kill it for Mike okay so

554
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm in encouraging filing issues in

555
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:58,050
github and creating pull requests that's

556
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,330
kind of standard procedure here okay so

557
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:03,570
the remainder of my slides are about

558
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:05,280
specific issues some of them I think are

559
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,700
close to resolution some might need some

560
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:12,870
discussion so I'm going to just jump

561
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:17,840
into those so the the the first issue

562
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:22,469
here was about claims optionality so

563
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,240
this is got a laser here I think not a

564
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,420
very good one but so this was the

565
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,200
current text then I went and read the

566
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:34,830
text in CWT and JWT I'm just throwing

567
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,420
button there and said oh that text looks

568
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:42,770
real that text looks really good so

569
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:47,460
let's just use that so it says that

570
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:50,940
certain profiles in certain situations

571
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,470
there may be requirements that some

572
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,410
claims are optional and some claims are

573
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,410
mandatory and all that but in absence of

574
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:02,420
any of those kinds of things claims that

575
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,420
are not understood must be ignored so

576
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,129
everybody's good with that then all I

577
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:13,050
got to do is really delete some of the

578
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:17,700
existing text and and we're happy any

579
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:27,260
discussion on that like tell me we're

580
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:30,000
doing it right no I'm looking at the

581
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:32,250
profiles allowed to override this

582
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,810
question I'll be raising this question

583
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:38,130
the room here right now is the next

584
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:39,800
thing I believe yeah I believe this text

585
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,030
here says that profiles can override

586
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,320
thanks yes in absence of such

587
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:48,210
requirements you

588
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:57,629
so according Hanks language here you're

589
00:30:48,210 --> 00:31:02,060
doing it right Mike actually I believe

590
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:05,190
that the text should say profiles must

591
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,740
override this because I think the whole

592
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:11,040
point of the profile is to say which

593
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,570
ones they actually want to use right so

594
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,930
if they don't do that then they're not a

595
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,730
profile or not useful as a profile right

596
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,310
so I think that's actually thing so your

597
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:23,160
document it should say tomorrow they are

598
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:25,020
all optional of course right but someone

599
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,450
who writes it whatever is gonna a

600
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:30,120
profile is it needs to say what they're

601
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,790
using and if they don't say it then they

602
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,399
wasted their time so I understand that's

603
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,830
the first bullet probably if you like

604
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,310
could be much stronger yeah so I'm just

605
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:44,639
loud must so what I'm just saying is

606
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:50,370
delete all this text and let the

607
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:52,040
inheritance of this text governor okay

608
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:57,409
good

609
00:31:52,040 --> 00:32:03,870
okay now or something kind of different

610
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:06,480
so UE IDs are an identifier kind of like

611
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:09,239
a serial number but not really a serial

612
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,560
number they they identify individual

613
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,030
instances of something if you have a

614
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,500
million phones and there's a million

615
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:18,750
different UE IDs so you ideas may have

616
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,530
something made up a new concept a new

617
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:25,740
idea new a new name for something you

618
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:29,820
yeji's did not exist prior to the a

619
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:34,290
draft there are two types of uue IDs one

620
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:38,960
is based on kind of a something very

621
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:42,379
well can't be based on the I Triple E

622
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,820
identifier which is often a mac address

623
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,460
so it can be based on that so that seems

624
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,110
all pretty straightforward but there

625
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,190
were a number of comments and questions

626
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:57,270
about UE IDs as random numbers so the

627
00:32:53,190 --> 00:33:00,570
idea is you can have you Eid that it

628
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:03,870
a random number at least 120 128 bits

629
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:07,110
should be cryptographic quality and if

630
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:11,179
you generate your Yui IDs that way there

631
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:15,810
will be enough collision resistance that

632
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:19,470
it will work just fine so there were the

633
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:22,590
two issues were raised one was is 128

634
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:25,080
bits enough and then the other is is a

635
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,760
statement about cryptographic quality

636
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,110
enough I guess the third issue here also

637
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,000
from Tom F was are you know are they

638
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,879
good in other so another version of are

639
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,200
they good enough so I've done some math

640
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:43,760
here on the 128 bits hopefully my math

641
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:49,470
is right but it seemed like enough bits

642
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,450
and then cryptographic quality saying it

643
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:56,580
must be a cryptographic quality number

644
00:33:51,450 --> 00:34:00,720
that's the text for it right there all

645
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:03,149
right Stuart Cherisher from Apple I'm

646
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,640
not sure whether 128 bits is or it's not

647
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:08,460
enough but your reasoning there I think

648
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,450
is flawed using the assumptions you've

649
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,710
got there the probability of my phone

650
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,839
conflicting is one in freedom per

651
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,418
trillion you do that a trillion trillion

652
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:21,330
times the probability of two devices

653
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,549
conflicting is guaranteed and if you've

654
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,500
not heard of the birthday problem look

655
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:29,419
it up on Wikipedia it will explain the

656
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,418
correct way to do this analysis okay

657
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:38,580
Thomas Thomas was easy consulting I can

658
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,580
give you the formula a spreadsheet which

659
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,069
given your maximum population size and

660
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,960
you expect a population size what is the

661
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,909
probability of collision this is a known

662
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,159
thing and I put in a nut it's in a

663
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,570
number of my graphs especially looking

664
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,780
at number my graphs and I have it at

665
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:57,030
very easy to spreadsheet and I'll get it

666
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,160
to you see I couldn't run it through but

667
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,060
very easily come out with what is the

668
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,270
actual pub

669
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,740
given the match and population size to

670
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:08,940
to the whatever did 128 and this many

671
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,459
devices what's my

672
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:16,290
gently all right so I'm clearly not

673
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:18,990
doing it right nice to get very so

674
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:22,560
worried but this is this you Eid thing

675
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,930
any different from just a UUID I mean

676
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,619
it's like I a delicious kanji yeah I

677
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,770
found it

678
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,569
I looked at the UUID and I explicitly

679
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,790
did not like the UI deeds it seemed like

680
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:36,890
the constructs were really complicated

681
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:40,020
were overly complicated and they

682
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:42,740
predated the idea of doing it with just

683
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:47,069
a cryptographic quality random number

684
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,348
sometimes you ideas are ephemeral

685
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:51,660
sometimes they're not so I found it

686
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:55,589
easier to just to go this direct this

687
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:58,049
way so I think you'll find the

688
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:01,109
established math and ecosystems around

689
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:03,569
you you IDs will give you exactly what

690
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,250
you're looking for with less work with

691
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:07,020
less definition in your document and

692
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,000
will do everything you need to do your

693
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,190
you IDs are well studied and widely

694
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,500
deployed pretty much everywhere so it's

695
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,720
something we're thinking about

696
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,440
mm-hmm I don't know I didn't find it so

697
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,509
but now well so okay so this is also

698
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,099
working group document now so we can

699
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,099
decide as a working group what the

700
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,140
correct decision is they both right I

701
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:32,849
think specifically focusing referencing

702
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:35,279
type for a - IDs which are use use some

703
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:37,890
system information and time stamps as

704
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,920
the source of as a seat for for

705
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,660
generating the random numbers okay I'm

706
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,130
gonna cut the mic at Bob because we

707
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,020
should probably move on right there

708
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:51,720
there is I just want to mention since

709
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:52,770
Stephen was discussing it so RFC RFC

710
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,368
4122

711
00:36:52,770 --> 00:37:00,000
talks about in the IETF how to generate

712
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:02,819
them so okay I'm awesome

713
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:12,599
obviously file comments on and github on

714
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:15,359
this too if you look in my higher hip

715
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,800
draft Appendix A you'll see the formula

716
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,799
right there okay

717
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:26,290
let's when I said yeah so part of the

718
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,590
nature also on non-common 12 is to not

719
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,990
just allow for proper generation if for

720
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:34,030
instance a hugh ID you I need you in the

721
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,459
context random number generator but to

722
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,680
also allow for random number generators

723
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:42,220
plus needs to be used in a deterministic

724
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,690
manner we have these cases where for

725
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,759
instance we would like to see an

726
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,920
attestation generated in a certain way

727
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,040
with a certain identifier akhantar off

728
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,170
of the device just make sure that it's

729
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,830
unconvicted the relying party relies on

730
00:37:53,170 --> 00:38:00,220
that on that same number being generated

731
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,960
the same way every single time so yes

732
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,770
when we talk about how to minimize

733
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:08,050
clashes between this different

734
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,810
generations of you IDs but but we also

735
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:13,630
get a way to allow manufacturers to

736
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:16,480
generate a UUID using the same

737
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,550
mechanisms you know in a deterministic

738
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,370
manner like over and over again from

739
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:30,940
from a known event and i'm you have any

740
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:36,730
document that you put it in github news

741
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:39,490
case yeah all right so some

742
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,950
characteristics of signing keys there's

743
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,569
some text in the document that says the

744
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,299
eat is always signed by the attestation

745
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:49,480
key material provisioned by the

746
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:51,790
manufacturer so some suggests removing

747
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,550
this to allow for ephemeral keys some

748
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,920
suggest strengthening key protection

749
00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:01,330
requirements requirements around the

750
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,940
signing keys as far as I can see CWT EJ

751
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:07,000
and and GWT do not make any comments

752
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:09,100
about signing keys I mean I guess kaze

753
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,930
does say generally you should protect

754
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:17,170
your signing keys my sense of this is

755
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:19,750
that most of the characteristics of

756
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,030
signing keys belong in profile documents

757
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:25,300
and that we want to be pretty similar to

758
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:29,200
the way JWT and see GWT work in the

759
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:33,280
eight draft so that probably means

760
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,589
removing this text and generally going

761
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,180
to the

762
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:39,280
making sure that we're lined up around

763
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:42,350
that comments please hi this is Hank

764
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,150
might not be a big surprise but some

765
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,029
suggest strengthening heat protection

766
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,980
requirements since interest to me

767
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,180
because we are legislation trust Britain

768
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,640
there's a little bit yeah

769
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,470
so if it's just my rich system committee

770
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,089
rated from a home directory that's

771
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,160
something that's entirely if it's a

772
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:00,320
shielded secret that has some

773
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,299
restriction on it to access it that you

774
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,340
have to for example Shah Integra nice or

775
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,020
something so I'm just saying in the eat

776
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,370
in the eat raft where you're not going

777
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:11,110
to talk about it I'm not saying you

778
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:14,569
other graphs guns and say life is good

779
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:18,020
because an attestation Troughton it's

780
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:21,140
highly important to convey the this

781
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:23,030
information or at least a way to get

782
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,910
this information because if the eat

783
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:29,450
itself tells you I was signed by a super

784
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,250
QoS well a secure a key that doesn't

785
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,890
enrich the information at all

786
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:36,430
it can't just be like so maybe maybe

787
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,230
there has to be a game that shows

788
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:44,660
there's a reference to some song I don't

789
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:47,540
know ta that confirms this in my mind

790
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,920
what I don't know is what it doesn't

791
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,350
seem like anything needs to go in the

792
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,790
eight draft for this other documents yes

793
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:58,160
but not to eat draft that's that's the

794
00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:00,110
eat would say we need this playing

795
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,899
edition in a to express that and then

796
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:05,200
music well I mean putting a claim about

797
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,160
the strength of the key material in

798
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,580
something that's signed by that key

799
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:13,310
material is self signed and therefore

800
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,930
not that meaningful so I don't see why

801
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,390
it would go in the eight draft

802
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:20,450
[Music]

803
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:23,500
so that's say that because the

804
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:27,410
trustworthiness seems to be the property

805
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:30,200
maybe not in this flame itself but maybe

806
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,790
profiles would have to do with that yeah

807
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,379
okay that's that's right that sounds

808
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:36,170
good

809
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:39,740
Gary mine didn't Qualcomm sorry I get it

810
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:41,840
by myself but I'm actually the opinion

811
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,990
that the Senate said that the Senate is

812
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,650
okay and I actually file a sheet on the

813
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,229
ephemeral he's based on the

814
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,529
based entropy from arm but that wasn't

815
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:54,150
my personal feeling is it a femoral keys

816
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:57,180
it should not be used for signing that

817
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:02,249
Westbay themselves are attested and now

818
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:03,779
you get into a loop okay yeah how you

819
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:05,879
tries to keep into your now you have to

820
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:08,910
have tested that you know I'm smelling

821
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,670
so for each I think if you at the top of

822
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:14,598
the top of the token should have it

823
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,799
should have some level of assurances

824
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,230
associated with its key material that's

825
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:22,799
done by having a key material vision

826
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:24,569
record but I mean the question to me

827
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:27,538
still is what goes in the draft versus

828
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:29,339
what goes elsewhere and I'm still kind

829
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:33,089
of looking for the consensus there and

830
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:35,038
it seems seems to me still that the key

831
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:36,480
material the strength of key material

832
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,619
should not be in the draft just like

833
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,589
it's not in the CWT drafter the JWT

834
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:45,990
RFC's so I disagree with the previous

835
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:47,490
speaker I'm sorry mr. Dave and I agree

836
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,669
with the proposal to move the tip

837
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,738
profile documents I submitted a number

838
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,630
of different use cases or references to

839
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,460
use cases that Michael put into the use

840
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,700
cases document and a number of those

841
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,309
would require your proposal because they

842
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,200
do not rely on some menu provision by

843
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:06,509
the manufacturer what you have to have

844
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,200
is you have to have a he material that

845
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:12,569
is trusted by the receiver of the eat

846
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,098
and there's different roles that could

847
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:16,259
be the receiver of the eat depending on

848
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:17,670
your use case and and some of those that

849
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:19,259
received the eat can trust something

850
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:22,319
other than the manufacturer for doing

851
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:24,059
its verification against reference

852
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,819
values or whatever the policy is of

853
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:28,470
course you can eat and so yes I agree

854
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,970
with your perhaps as plums in profile

855
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,019
documents please do that I think that

856
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,519
makes eats much more generally

857
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:36,808
applicable to the various use cases that

858
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:39,180
are in the use cases document think adam

859
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:41,009
whatever critical technologies um I'm

860
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,109
agreeing with what you're saying here it

861
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:44,940
should be not in the eat draft to make

862
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:48,538
it more general and as you had just

863
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,609
previously said however I feel almost

864
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:52,739
like this happens all the time we're

865
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:55,319
pointing the issue into another draft

866
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:56,220
and this is turning into a turtles all

867
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:59,369
the way down situation

868
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:01,770
but it always will so I don't know if

869
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,940
that really want to bring up but we're

870
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:09,720
always gonna run into it again and again

871
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:11,819
on the jiff to get beyond this hey would

872
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,839
it be okay if we actually mentioned this

873
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:18,329
in security considerations what sets us

874
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,670
here and move this into profile so we

875
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:29,430
can say that clustered it so we can make

876
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:31,380
comments about trust you're looking at

877
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:38,069
me like you're asking me to answer the

878
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:41,130
question so I to me that issue is trying

879
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:43,980
to constrain the each document to

880
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:46,710
signature by the manufacturer

881
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:50,000
hey there are many different use cases

882
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:52,260
of eats like whether the eat goes to the

883
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,150
verifier or whether the each is part of

884
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,230
the SS station so or whatever another

885
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,359
different use gives you different ways

886
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:00,690
to compose it right if you say it's key

887
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,848
material that is trusted by the receiver

888
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,020
that's a perfect thing just talk about

889
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:06,540
the security considerations and

890
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,310
manufacture is one common example that's

891
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,810
a great example right but there are

892
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,339
cases were there other examples that

893
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,009
still use key material trusted by the

894
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:15,720
receiver where the it doesn't change the

895
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,920
manufacturer per se it changed some

896
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:22,589
other entity that's trusted by the

897
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:26,970
receiver all right I'll take a shot at

898
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:30,509
that in the security considerations okay

899
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:33,000
a verification process I think there's

900
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:39,089
two uses of the term verification and

901
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:45,000
verifying that are in rats there's in

902
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:47,460
the CWT JWT case and that's mostly and

903
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,589
there's very explicit text in both CWT

904
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,720
and GWT that's primarily around

905
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:55,290
verifying the signatures on the cosy and

906
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,490
Jose then there's the end and rats

907
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:01,920
verification mostly Illumina so so I

908
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:04,950
think eat just inherits from

909
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,910
JWT and CWT so I don't think there's any

910
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:12,770
need for any that text in

911
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:15,799
the eat document I thought about it that

912
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:17,930
text looks pretty good so I actually

913
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,630
think we're covered on the verification

914
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:24,259
process in terms of that but for the

915
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:25,460
larger and the end that you know it's

916
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,600
another that's that's where now we're

917
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:32,960
talking about the turtles again but so

918
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,370
with the rats end-to-end verification

919
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,140
I'm not really sure what you mean by

920
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:38,720
that do you mean the attestation

921
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:46,520
provenance you know you have the

922
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:48,799
verifier and all the things you just do

923
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,110
just verification was so overloaded that

924
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,210
it that evidence is appraised and yeah

925
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,820
but you have a verifier as a role so

926
00:46:53,210 --> 00:47:00,650
that's potential well that's why it's

927
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:02,510
verify star star yeah okay so I probably

928
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,970
I probably sheet it's not I don't

929
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:07,010
believe the slide it's it's not a

930
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,480
perfect reflection of why I did that I

931
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,820
think it's more along the lines of

932
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,080
reflecting off of reflecting on both

933
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,610
verification guidance that would be that

934
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,560
that would improve the readability of

935
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:20,480
document would be kind of necessary for

936
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,190
an independent readers putting that in

937
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,950
all in one section so they can get

938
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:28,420
straight to it I agree that we inherent

939
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,040
pretty much all our verification

940
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,530
procedures and Coco is a and Cosette I

941
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,330
think you know I think it's not any harm

942
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:38,450
to state that even though there's some

943
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:39,799
people that feel it's obvious I do feel

944
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,379
that there are some things that are a

945
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,420
little subtle and how claims are claims

946
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,670
are interpreted by verifies that the

947
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,260
week will be questioned if we're audit

948
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,060
review as we try to take this into a

949
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,090
standard and it was I would like to get

950
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:54,740
ahead of it I don't think it's it we

951
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,570
could put that underneath under the

952
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:03,859
individual discussions under - did you

953
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:05,710
acclaims but so that was my motivation i

954
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:09,730
like a chance to just create the PR

955
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:13,310
people review it before closing out this

956
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:17,240
OC this so CWT and JWT a don't say

957
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:19,310
anything about appraising checking or

958
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,080
validating the value of the claims

959
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:23,960
themselves they just disguise

960
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,569
the signature check and the overall and

961
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,510
that was that's and and to me that

962
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:32,480
that's where each land and the the

963
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:35,420
validation of the claims is the larger

964
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:40,220
and and you know another turtle yeah I

965
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:43,310
think we we did highlighted that there

966
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:45,529
are some things related to you claim

967
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:54,830
interpretation based on the fact that

968
00:48:45,530 --> 00:49:06,310
each inherits from CWT okay okay yeah I

969
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:09,380
so I I think that doesn't belong okay

970
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:13,420
Tony yeah Tony Hadley

971
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:17,270
I noticed he didn't have a notion of a

972
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:19,550
presentation or a presenter right of the

973
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,680
claim itself so there is the issuer of

974
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,410
the claim and then there may be a

975
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:29,629
presenter of the claim which may not be

976
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:32,990
the same thing so you know the device or

977
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:36,130
whatever may actually have a claim right

978
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:38,479
and a signature on it but they may also

979
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,540
something else may actually wrap those

980
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,260
up into another you know since you have

981
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:47,259
nested JW T's in there or proposed

982
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:50,300
nested in there then you can have a

983
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,420
presenter of this claim which is not the

984
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:57,380
same thing as the issuer in the claim

985
00:49:52,420 --> 00:50:05,960
okay so if you thought about that

986
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:10,310
situation like John's Microsoft I was

987
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:13,730
going to give an example I inhabit your

988
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:16,100
office I was going to give an example of

989
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:19,670
that very distinction in a recent job

990
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:23,900
I've seen which is the security event

991
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:28,040
token specification makes a distinction

992
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:30,920
between issuer and presenter for exactly

993
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,089
the reasons that Tony talks about and at

994
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,719
least us we're describing

995
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:39,619
that linguistic distinction which is a

996
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:43,109
semantic distinction is worth

997
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:47,339
maintaining and can somebody for the

998
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:49,558
notes look yes and look at money for the

999
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:52,799
notes look up security of F tokenism

1000
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:56,099
but the RFC number in the notes and was

1001
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:59,038
that relevant Texaco in the eight draft

1002
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:01,619
already go in some other document well

1003
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,959
since I don't tell me since I don't

1004
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:06,659
think we're picking up the event threat

1005
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:08,009
heater I will yeah say that the same

1006
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:10,619
concept needs to be incorporated

1007
00:51:08,009 --> 00:51:12,439
somewhere into this particular document

1008
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:15,479
since we're not picking up all the ID

1009
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:17,489
okay it's done as it goes on and that's

1010
00:51:15,479 --> 00:51:23,549
right I'll look at it

1011
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:28,019
I think that's oh okay the definition of

1012
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:34,409
we do it on time okay okay okay

1013
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:45,448
definition of entity that's FC eighty

1014
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:47,069
four seventeen okay alright so I was so

1015
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:51,599
the definition of manatees arson issued

1016
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:54,390
some comments about that I chose to make

1017
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,329
the definition sort of its intended to

1018
00:51:54,390 --> 00:52:02,279
be open and somewhat ambiguous tuned are

1019
00:51:57,329 --> 00:52:04,049
not artificially limit eat use so some

1020
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:06,890
examples it could be a completely device

1021
00:52:04,049 --> 00:52:10,409
like a phone an appliance or even a car

1022
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:12,868
a subcomponent could be an entity as

1023
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:14,400
well a secure element or ite or the

1024
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:16,709
engine controller or the antenna

1025
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,529
entertainment subsystem or even an

1026
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:22,158
Android app or a Windows app that those

1027
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:26,009
could be an ADIZ that could generate

1028
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:28,349
eight tokens so trying to be pretty

1029
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:30,029
broad and open not trying to lock

1030
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:32,640
anything down in particularly in the

1031
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:35,819
eight draft now profiles you can go

1032
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,848
really tight and detailed and you know

1033
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:42,479
only if it was done you know al six

1034
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:45,119
Common Criteria AVL whatever you could

1035
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:48,288
do that but in the a draft no minimum

1036
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,289
security requirement so

1037
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:54,530
you know I've kind of described the

1038
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:57,590
entity in some words I'm not that happy

1039
00:52:54,530 --> 00:53:00,680
with the current text basically I'm

1040
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:02,060
seeking suggestions and advice find my

1041
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,810
way to do a little better job of

1042
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:07,700
describing now one other comment I do

1043
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:10,190
have about that is I did look around a

1044
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:15,049
little bit to see who else uses the term

1045
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:19,580
entity x1 2 5 2 defines it as something

1046
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:21,590
very broad the e draft is using it a

1047
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:25,549
little bit more narrow but it is it is

1048
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:29,510
sort of within the scope of what x1 2 v

1049
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:33,380
2 defines its own comments please yeah

1050
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:37,150
Robin Wilton just to mention there's a

1051
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:43,910
guy in Australia called Raja claw CLA

1052
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:48,920
okay who defines entity as part of a

1053
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:51,799
taxonomy of identity anima T and so on

1054
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,090
it not say that should change the

1055
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,220
definitions you have here which i think

1056
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:58,460
is compatible but it's interesting to

1057
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:00,319
look at how in his taxonomy if it's in a

1058
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,480
whole lot of other things that you might

1059
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:06,860
will find okay here yeah I didn't get

1060
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,470
the reference but it'll probably take

1061
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,850
Euler you're doing it right if you're

1062
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:15,140
looking for the references within the

1063
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:17,660
IETF RFC for 133 not to be confused with

1064
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:19,910
4 1 to 2 that we talked about before 3 3

1065
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:21,680
is the entity nib which is how do you

1066
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:23,540
manage an entity as a generic concept

1067
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,859
that I can't it kind of matches this I

1068
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,360
don't know if there's any language in

1069
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,740
that you can steal but I think that the

1070
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,690
definition there it's compatible with

1071
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,100
yours and so it's a potential reference

1072
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,850
you might want to look at seating so

1073
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:37,640
anything okay Tony Netherlands since you

1074
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:40,940
mentioned the X used us to look at 29 1

1075
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:43,370
1 5 ice between them 1 1 5 which is

1076
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:45,320
slightly different definition of entity

1077
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:46,819
even though they're mirror documents

1078
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:51,880
there's a little bit of twist on this

1079
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:54,920
too okay all right that's all I got I

1080
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,640
guess question could I see a show of

1081
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,640
hands one work

1082
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:04,368
because it's an outstanding issues on

1083
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:07,019
this related to a claim registration I

1084
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:08,160
don't think we need to put innovation of

1085
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:09,720
discussion on the mailing list I don't

1086
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,799
think we need to put any additional

1087
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:16,558
guidance in this document on the use of

1088
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:19,619
Cawdor jawed registries but registering

1089
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,200
these claims registering these claims or

1090
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:23,490
any cancer profiles I just wanted to

1091
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,799
make sure that's the case that we can

1092
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:29,609
close any related issues in the day if

1093
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:31,799
you can find the github okay I've got

1094
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:34,769
that I've got a copy that making the

1095
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:37,140
cutoff of a grating on this if not

1096
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:39,359
you'll hear sort of you health okay I'm

1097
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:43,558
gonna I'm gonna kind of assume that yep

1098
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:45,538
going forward but you know where to you

1099
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,010
know where to complain all right thank

1100
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:48,900
you

1101
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:57,859
show of hands up who's that read the eat

1102
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:57,859
draft would like to see more hands yeah

1103
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,010
well more importantly when you see

1104
00:56:00,299 --> 00:56:03,690
issues please we're tracking them

1105
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:06,319
through the issues and a github so

1106
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,319
thanks

1107
00:56:13,399 --> 00:56:21,899
I'll get there okay so we wanted to

1108
00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:24,779
cover the milestone since we're gonna be

1109
00:56:21,899 --> 00:56:26,969
updating them so on tomorrow we're gonna

1110
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:30,179
be talking about or we have

1111
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:31,949
presentations for updates on a couple of

1112
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:35,089
the drafts but there are still a few

1113
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:38,429
that aren't on the docket so I wanted to

1114
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:41,969
pulse because there was some discussion

1115
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:44,819
that perhaps on the token bind that that

1116
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:49,439
we wouldn't move forward but I wanted to

1117
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:54,779
confirm that with the group does anybody

1118
00:56:49,439 --> 00:57:04,949
object if we just drop it from our work

1119
00:56:54,779 --> 00:57:07,319
items we're just not doing it okay so if

1120
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:08,759
you have objections let me know but I

1121
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:10,259
don't think it's something since we

1122
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,569
haven't adopted it it's not anything

1123
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:18,479
that we need to take to the list the

1124
00:57:12,569 --> 00:57:20,519
second one is to does so I'm okay

1125
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:22,589
so you're not presenting on to dad but

1126
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:27,169
I'm presuming that you still want to

1127
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:34,799
move that forward yes we have

1128
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:38,368
development processes that yes thank you

1129
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:41,309
you're learning yes or no you're

1130
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:43,889
learning okay so with that um tomorrow

1131
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:46,439
we have a full agenda so I encourage

1132
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:49,229
everybody to review the the new updated

1133
00:57:46,439 --> 00:57:52,469
drafts that we're going to be discussing

1134
00:57:49,229 --> 00:57:57,058
tomorrow tomorrow we are going to allow

1135
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:58,999
some time to discuss where and how we

1136
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:02,189
want to move forward visa Vee

1137
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:02,698
information model okay with that thank

1138
00:58:02,189 --> 00:58:06,509

1139
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:09,019
