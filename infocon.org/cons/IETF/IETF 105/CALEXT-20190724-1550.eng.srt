1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,430
the state monologue when George

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,320
Washington designed back was designed by

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,540
each stage of the space usually have

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,419
these contests compositions or whatever

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:21,519
for designing play by immersing in the

6
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:25,660
head as the tactical line is national in

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:29,198
numismatic culture like the face is

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:40,660
called the rockers and the other is

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:01:13,500
called the reverse our chair is thirty

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:01:13,500
seconds late good afternoon everyone

11
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:24,959

00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:40,300
meeting your intended then you're

15
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:43,119
probably in the wrong room I see four

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,920
percents on the on the line some of them

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,959
are in the room also and do we have any

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,509
JavaScript

19
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,509
okay thank here any minute takers

20
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:02,780
everyone looks so busy on the laptop

21
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:07,400
[Laughter]

22
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,400
we're on you have very stylish headgear

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:18,540
okay so please take some time to read

24
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,209
the not well and though I don't expect

25
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,489
people people to be very aggressive not

26
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:39,390
that we we won't tolerate aggressive

27
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:48,570
behaviors I'm trying to how do we escape

28
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:56,940
from that no from the screen

29
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:58,829
at length I'm pressing escape push

30
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:11,989
strains slide pushy here

31
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:11,989
oh okay okay no I have to look for you

32
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,390
so here we are so first first

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:30,298
presentation and mic is that easier for

34
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:33,470
you do you want to take okay so maybe we

35
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,470
can have a GS calendar

36
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:54,220
how can you come to this okay sure so

37
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:54,220
let's move on so that should be the okay

38
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:32,900
this one okay oh you can take mine okay

39
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:34,880
that one does work yeah okay so yes so

40
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,200
this is in last call I did publish a new

41
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,090
draft yesterday which is mainly

42
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,550
formatting and editorial revision to

43
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,760
just try and make it as readable and

44
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,919
understandable as possible there were

45
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,340
two small additions which I've noted

46
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,070
here on the slide one was a extra

47
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,440
property on the participant where you

48
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,710
could record a comment that they made

49
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,190
whilst applying this is a common feature

50
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,710
that is already being represented in

51
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,500
iCalendar with custom vendor specific

52
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,859
properties and so i thought with a

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,830
standard property for like if you said

54
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,650
maybe you can write because i just my

55
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,340
kids birthday or something and

56
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,560
recurrence ID which is also needed

57
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:28,940
mapping from iCalendar which is exactly

58
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:34,070
the same as it is in iCalendar so i'm

59
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:37,490
going to actual changes I think the we

60
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,800
have the calyx V alarm extensions draft

61
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,330
when we discuss slightly later which is

62
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,460
adding some extra properties there the

63
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,300
we need to make sure we match I think we

64
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,299
actually already do

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,539
the acknowledged property already exists

66
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,729
on alerts which is exactly the same as

67
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:58,340
in that extension so you can synchronize

68
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:03,110
dismissing and alert between different

69
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:05,030
calendar clients snooze snoozing alert

70
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,380
is defined in that extension is actually

71
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,669
a protocol thing rather than a data

72
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,409
representation thing there's no data

73
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,508
representation for that so it's not

74
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,870
needed in J's calendar the only thing

75
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:17,090
left there for in there is proximity

76
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,560
alerts I don't know if we want to add

77
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,948
that to the data model here or we can

78
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,750
always go in an extension so if anyone

79
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,870
has a particular view on whether we

80
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,720
should try and add that in you can step

81
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,340
up so this is the being able to store in

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,870
the data model that an alert should fire

83
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,619
when you enter or leave a certain

84
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,599
physical location which is been defined

85
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,520
in this extension the alarm extensions

86
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,680
by calendar should that be in J's

87
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:54,219
calendar does this microphone this

88
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:55,849
microphone works you're connected

89
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,690
excellent

90
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:01,460
so it's just going to ask what's the

91
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,650
extension model for the J's calendar

92
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,989
format how would you how would you mark

93
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:10,909
something as an extension well I mean

94
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,820
it's extendable in the same way as I

95
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:19,159
condiment you can define new properties

96
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:20,270
with future rfcs that is the main sensor

97
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,610
model and also you can have vendor

98
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,840
specific properties but like in my

99
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,039
comment about we won't discourage those

100
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,039
because they're not paying profitable

101
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,330
yeah it's more how do you stop two

102
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:35,120
vendors overriding each other do you

103
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,219
have to prefix there anything because

104
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,469
the data formatting because the data

105
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,300
format not a protocol there's no

106
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:44,690
possibility for negotiation for that

107
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,360
kind of thing so it the spec already

108
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,699
requires vendor specific prefix prefix

109
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,380
for each custom property which is domain

110
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,740
name controlled by that vendor so you

111
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,960
can't get collision all right and if we

112
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,960
standardize something how do we indicate

113
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,539
which version so I we

114
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,479
what if we standardize an extension to

115
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:09,449
Jay's calendar had a reader of Jays

116
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,550
calendar know which version it's reading

117
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,669
well it's the property name that's

118
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,229
standardized and so that property name

119
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,229
shouldn't be used because it's a

120
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,389
beforehand because it's either until

121
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:22,859
it's it's not a cleaning on one you can

122
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:27,300
use with a vendor specific property and

123
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,220
so until it's in a icy-pop or defined in

124
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,020
a future standard this just doesn't

125
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,300
exist this is just the same as in my

126
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,610
calendar other formats as I said because

127
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,218
it's a format not the protocol you can't

128
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,320
negotiate a version or something else

129
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,940
that's up to whatever's using Jess

130
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,260
calendar or using a calendar they can

131
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,480
negotiate versions if need be

132
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,189
yeah for the first time we've redefined

133
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,730
the behavior of property we're going to

134
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:55,080
have issues if you've no fines that I

135
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:57,140
don't receive yeah yes don't do that as

136
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,459
you add new properties and stared at her

137
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:05,430
you can use this will be a bit better

138
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:10,949
model so Daniel do you know when the

139
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:12,870
last call expires for this I so when the

140
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,500
last products pies I think it has

141
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:20,190
expired for a long time I mean there is

142
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,920
no fixed limit for free so we can run it

143
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,170
as long as we want sure I I think it is

144
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,969
basically ready for publication at this

145
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,490
point so yeah I think we could set a

146
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,649
deadline of another week or two to give

147
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,790
people chance to eat the final draft but

148
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:37,440
then I would be looking to move this on

149
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,420
camera Tristan regarding proximity

150
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,550
alarms since it's already deployed in

151
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,839
the field and I can't or anything could

152
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,370
be worthwhile putting in this effect as

153
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,140
well so knows we've gone in proximity

154
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:52,260
yes was it yes okay thanks

155
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,689
so it does it imply some changes to to

156
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,910
the current document yes so one change

157
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,320
of adding one extra property one extra

158
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,899
section into the alerts bit of a

159
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,930
different trigger obviously which yeah

160
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:06,660
which is oh yeah I can can try it it's

161
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,399
it's been deployed in a vendor Pacific

162
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,569
way that's being standardized in this I

163
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,980
can't do extension which we'll get to

164
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,180
later so we should probably just have it

165
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,930
in the Jess calendar from the start as

166
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:22,370
well so the other thing we can

167
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:25,160
do also is have wait that the VL arm is

168
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,170
being sent and sent them together so

169
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,719
that's also one option I don't think

170
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,219
they need to be tied together actually I

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,410
think you just define it separately in

172
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,339
both okay I'm fine

173
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,980
so I think this draft gets a significant

174
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:45,830
number of review especially compared to

175
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:48,770
the usual average reviews we have my

176
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,920
opinion is that it's almost ready we

177
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,149
choose to have this long term last goal

178
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,120
just to get more and more feedbacks so

179
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:03,200
to comment through we received were

180
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:06,339
discussed on the mailing list I think it

181
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,740
has been quite openly discussed and

182
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:12,380
consensus have been reached

183
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:16,399
yeah I would consider this draft done so

184
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,529
I'm waiting a few weeks and sending to

185
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,220
the ASG

186
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:25,160
okay thank you oh there's one one next

187
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,900
slide so there's another related so this

188
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,029
is an informational RFC which we're also

189
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,970
going to publish they don't need to be

190
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:34,939
published concurrently I think this one

191
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,050
will go out afterwards advising on J's

192
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:42,560
calendar to iCalendar translation it's

193
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,229
informational because deliberately it's

194
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,119
it's not a straight it's not just a

195
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,700
syntactical version of iconic like Jake

196
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,250
Ali's so some translation bits for

197
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,570
obscure edge cases you can't do exact

198
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,220
translation so you might want to do

199
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,459
different things in different situations

200
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,170
I think almost all commonly used

201
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:01,660
features and I calendars quite straight

202
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,029
forward and so it's worth documenting

203
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,469
just so people have that reference I

204
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,390
think Robert

205
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,980
stepanak who is the co-author on Jess

206
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,079
calendar will finish this document off

207
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,480
he's away on leave for the next month or

208
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,469
so but I don't think there's a rush to

209
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,850
get that out so just noting that that's

210
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,260
there's a draft up it's actually

211
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,910
reasonably complete and we'll finish

212
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,600
that off after Jess calendars published

213
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,430
okay right so this one my stained

214
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,350
working group last call

215
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,459
the other one goes to the yeah if I

216
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,450
don't even know if that one is in

217
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,839
working group law school whatever

218
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,760
separate I haven't didn't actually check

219
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,100
we started a working group last for for

220
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,510
one document that split never split it

221
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:47,720
that's right yeah yeah so yeah yeah okay

222
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:55,670
okay

223
00:12:47,720 --> 00:13:05,690
any comment no so let's move Michael did

224
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:10,120
you solve the i/o issues okay so maybe

225
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,120
we go to vlr sure

226
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,500
okay so this this draft is one I

227
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,150
inherited from the original author at

228
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,980
Apple it I think it's fairly

229
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,600
straightforward it documents existing

230
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,910
practice it's already been deployed I

231
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,710
were to try to standardize it so that

232
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,020
other implementations can follow suit so

233
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:47,340
first thing it does this I think is

234
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:49,770
fairly uncontroversial it standardizes

235
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,390
that pretty much every component now

236
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,630
should have a UID so they can be

237
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,310
uniquely identified and that's all this

238
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,620
does so if you got multiple arms they

239
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,979
each have their own UID so if any reason

240
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,120
to address them and some shape or form

241
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,680
it's easily to do so next slide as Neil

242
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,860
had mentioned earlier and not a lot of

243
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,030
acknowledgment is a big thing so if you

244
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,860
have multiple clients that are all

245
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,920
firing different alarms is it'd be nice

246
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,200
to at least on the first one fires you

247
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,240
write back some type of property saying

248
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,000
I have analogous so that your other your

249
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,760
other clients don't continue to fire and

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,410
that is done the next slide

251
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,819
with this new acknowledged property

252
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,420
which Neil's our to discussed is

253
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,670
basically just the UTC time that you

254
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,500
acknowledge the alarm when the event

255
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:42,030
gets updated other clients should see it

256
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,130
and not continue to fire smoothing up

257
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,500
snoozing alarms this is a pretty

258
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,950
standard thing that people won't like to

259
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:53,040
do what this does is just formalize a

260
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,560
procedure for doing so so when you hit

261
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,709
snooze on your device what happens is a

262
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,599
new alarm that's a sibling of the one

263
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,870
that fired meaning it's under the same

264
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:09,690
parent component will get created with a

265
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:11,880
UTC time to fire and you in theory you

266
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:16,530
could add multiples of these if you

267
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,970
wanted to and when each one reaches its

268
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,850
conclusion you can do the same thing

269
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:25,770
with the acknowledge property to stop

270
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,670
that last item location-based alarms or

271
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,770
proximity alarms is as Neil described

272
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,229
anybody it's has a iPhone is probably

273
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,630
see this in action basically what it

274
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,150
what it means is

275
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,939
you fire the alarm as you get as you

276
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,770
enter or leave a particular location in

277
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,720
this case there's a new structured

278
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,199
location property which is defined in

279
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,360
Mike's event publication Draft in this

280
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,220
particular situation the URI you would

281
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,180
use would be a Geo URI specifying the

282
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,460
location that you want to fire upon

283
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,719
there's also two other values that can

284
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,120
be used for the proximity alarm that

285
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,030
Apple is currently using we felt would

286
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,010
be fine to standardize them here as well

287
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,860
this is the connect and disconnect these

288
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,920
actually occur I believe with apple

289
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,230
carplay so when you enter your car and a

290
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,589
Bluetooth signal or Bluetooth connection

291
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,380
gets made

292
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:21,830
you can fire alarms based on those I

293
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,450
don't know what the use cases but apples

294
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,370
seem to think it was important enough to

295
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,050
put them in their draft I don't I don't

296
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,090
think there's any reason to not put them

297
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,729
in this particular draft unless somebody

298
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,340
feels differently to basically his

299
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,900
values in a registry and here's a simple

300
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,670
example of what one of these things

301
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:45,949
might look like with the two your geo

302
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:49,969
URI is based on the geographic area or

303
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:52,490
can I say 8 o'clock anytime anywhere in

304
00:16:49,970 --> 00:17:01,610
the world this this one is only based on

305
00:16:52,490 --> 00:17:05,770
physical location ok no yes yes Neil

306
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:09,980
Jenkins oh yeah they connect disconnect

307
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,089
just wonder if we want to have some

308
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,579
other property of saying connect

309
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,889
disconnect what like it could if you

310
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:18,050
omit it it could be device specific

311
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,110
which then is whatever Apple wants it to

312
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,389
be we're now using it but it is perhaps

313
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,979
slightly overly specific at the moment I

314
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,260
think in the spec it's like a car

315
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,850
Bluetooth which you wouldn't infer

316
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,300
necessarily directly from the fact that

317
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:34,550
just says school connect exactly right

318
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,760
right from the spec it is a to make our

319
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:40,340
places I think the text stipulates that

320
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,400
in one use case is the Bluetooth

321
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,929
scenario oh is that it yeah I don't I

322
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,940
don't think it's I'd only it's not

323
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,600
directly tied to that it could be any

324
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,460
type of connector disconnect up of that

325
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,540
yeah I'm not I'm not wedded to this I'm

326
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,190
not gonna die on this hill if we

327
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:02,389
determine that it's too vague or too

328
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:07,670
specific to put in the spec seems

329
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:10,250
potentially useful but like you said it

330
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,970
doesn't specifically say connect or

331
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:18,830
disconnect from what so it may be under

332
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:23,240
specified so do the people from Apple

333
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,830
can we ask them or if we think if we can

334
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:34,520
find anybody who's still on the calendar

335
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:37,070
team they're willing to answer just sort

336
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,230
of having stepped into this so we're

337
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:43,159
kind of overloading calendars to do

338
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:46,400
other because calendars dual arms where

339
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,250
setting up alarms that are not temporal

340
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,470
bases which is what a calendar is but in

341
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:56,320
this case the the proximity alarm would

342
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:58,820
be most likely in a task not in an event

343
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,189
so you see so you set yourself up a task

344
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,560
to pick up milk and they'll arm fires

345
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,890
when you leave the office or get close

346
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,649
to the market or what have you

347
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:19,160
I'll buy that thanks for filling me in

348
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:21,590
welcome I haven't haven't read the draft

349
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:26,300
but what's ever thought of of privacy

350
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:29,780
considerations for this that is nothing

351
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:33,700
fleshed out no all this will a lot of

352
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:36,260
geolocation information is quite

353
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:40,130
personal so at least need some texture

354
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,510
on that but Neil Jenkins can yeah I mean

355
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,000
I think the main thing there is just

356
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,500
don't let other people add alarms with

357
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,940
proximity on it to your calendar because

358
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,470
that might then be way of them fine

359
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,019
you have to have had some experience

360
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,139
with the GOP working group to understand

361
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:59,559
the issues here is huge privacy issues

362
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:03,168
around geolocation

363
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:08,149
do the ATS have any reference to

364
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:10,100
suggested text that might cover this you

365
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:12,258
should talk with Richard Barnes or

366
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,509
Alyssa Cooper who were chairs of the geo

367
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:17,740
probe working group and they can tell

368
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,740
you all you would like to know about

369
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,710
I know Jenkins you know I did just check

370
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,960
this back it connect is connected to a

371
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:39,019
Bluetooth enabled automobile which to

372
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:40,759
sound slightly specific to me in general

373
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:44,330
it would be a good idea to have a chat

374
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:47,629
with Alyssa about this before she has to

375
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,519
review it as an ad because she's almost

376
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:51,799
certain to put it discuss on it about

377
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:56,139
privacy issues if you haven't already

378
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,139
sorted that out right okay fair enough

379
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:04,789
any other discussion points before we

380
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,019
see if Mike is back online okay well let

381
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:12,500
me get out of here before he loses

382
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:14,029
connectivity yeah thank you I'm

383
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:20,500
wondering Braun do you want to say

384
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:23,769
something not particularly

385
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,769
[Music]

386
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:37,100
I'm gonna let the floor to mine either

387
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:40,010
have a hint of advice that I would

388
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:55,809
suggest the open only slots in separate

389
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:55,809
tabs I didn't hear you bro okay yeah

390
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Micha

391
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:35,720
[Music]

392
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:35,720
Michael can you hear us okay

393
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:21,590
so well maybe I can start the time zone

394
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:26,450
discussion we had and any time Michael

395
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,699
is ready you take the slot does it work

396
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:35,450
for the people in the room as well yes

397
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:38,630
okay so time zone distribution system is

398
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:42,500
basically a discussion we initiated a

399
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:49,430
few weeks ago I think and or maybe one

400
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:51,680
week ago and the reason for that for

401
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,560
that for starting that discussion was

402
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,750
mostly that IANA had this budget

403
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,179
discussion for a four years plan so we

404
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,400
just wanted to see if there are

405
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:07,160
something ready we could ask them to do

406
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:09,680
or so so that it became plan so so far

407
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,230
I'm just gonna try to summarize all the

408
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,990
different things we that have been

409
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:20,570
discussed on the mailing list and but

410
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:22,940
the big conclusion is well they're the

411
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,899
awesome people people are quite

412
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,740
enthusiastic about doing something so

413
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:34,340
that the teas that data be appropriately

414
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:39,640
distributed with a given protocol time

415
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:44,449
zone distribution but on the other hand

416
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:47,840
we are not very much ready to to propose

417
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:52,550
either a system or a protocol for the

418
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,610
IANA so we're basically asking the iron

419
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:58,700
there to to remain in touch in the with

420
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:01,939
those discussions so that they can jump

421
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:07,580
anything we're saying sayings or

422
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:11,140
thinking something wrong so among the

423
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:16,550
different feedbacks we received we

424
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:20,150
perceive them well I would say some

425
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:22,610
insight that we're clearly not ready we

426
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,900
need to better understand the global

427
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:27,949
ecosystem

428
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:30,380
better reach out the people people that

429
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:33,410
are expected to deploy this time zone

430
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,760
distribution before the defining the

431
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:40,309
system to understand what their needs

432
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,980
are and then to elaborate the system to

433
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:47,809
understand the resources involved for

434
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,660
that system to better quantify qualify

435
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:54,110
all the requirements in terms of

436
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:58,220
resource as well as a usage and probably

437
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:01,280
then if evaluate how the product will be

438
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,730
a we have been designing so far which is

439
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,790
mostly time zone distribution but maybe

440
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:10,550
also the data the time zone data we've

441
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:19,030
been defined we have defined how much

442
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:23,240
they fit all this system so on the list

443
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:26,200
there were at least two two different

444
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:30,620
things that have been suggested as the

445
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,710
time zone distribution service one which

446
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,689
was a sort of global service and another

447
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:42,110
one which was a sort of distribution

448
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:46,250
master so we need to to really focus on

449
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:48,110
well apparently the distributed master

450
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,800
is probably the one we want to target

451
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:53,800
but we need to have this kind of

452
00:26:50,800 --> 00:27:01,070
discussion to understand exactly where

453
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:04,309
whether what our target should be and

454
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:07,550
the reason and a global service may not

455
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:09,250
make sense is that the people

456
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:13,159
distributing the time zone data

457
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,860
sometimes do do not actually necessarily

458
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,690
distribute the time zone data as

459
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,580
provided by the INR but sometimes they

460
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:24,980
add some tweaks and some adjustments so

461
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,290
that's a how close data is being used

462
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:33,410
that we I mean our protocol needs to

463
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:36,710
feel what about the resource

464
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:44,390
so the amount of data though though it

465
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:52,130
needs much more studies well it's a half

466
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:56,090
a megabyte or two hundred kilobytes 100

467
00:27:52,130 --> 00:28:01,250
kilobytes so it's not huge data that's

468
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:18,199
it that's a one thing so the larger

469
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:22,600
sister V time zones the iCalendar yeah

470
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:43,280
it's it's not supposed to string that is

471
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:46,520
okay so then how do yes yeah it is it's

472
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:50,030
not it depends how many time this moment

473
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:59,090
data is being distributed but it's not

474
00:28:50,030 --> 00:29:01,310
terabyte so the frequencies so that's

475
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,429
the frequencies of the release which

476
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:07,429
it's not exactly the same as how many

477
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:13,280
changes appears because usually you have

478
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:15,440
a set of changes that is being that

479
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,320
generates one release and so data

480
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,720
I don't really know so some people were

481
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,340
complaining that the sad thing is that

482
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,790
they have to wait for the next release

483
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:28,070
so that the thing that I've been fixed

484
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:32,450
that are not directly pushed or they

485
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:34,730
can't deliver those changes so it might

486
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:37,970
be something by improving the

487
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:40,850
synchronization we may have a finer

488
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:45,140
granularity than the release that are

489
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:47,270
currently being used though I don't know

490
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:51,140
how how much impact

491
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:55,700
are the changes on the time zone in 1945

492
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:58,910
or so yeah I don't know exactly what

493
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:02,960
makes a new release and what makes an

494
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:06,530
update or will the update concern only

495
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:11,440
the latest data at the current date that

496
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:17,629
I have right now at the current date or

497
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:22,370
older history so estimation of the

498
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:25,970
growth per year is 5% but that's a

499
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:30,110
number that just that was taken from the

500
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:32,690
mind of pull a Gert so not know studies

501
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:37,729
have been on itself just raw data

502
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:40,370
worst case was a eighty where we have 18

503
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,710
release so it's still in our alphabet so

504
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:45,819
we can still have a letter

505
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,819
[Music]

506
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:53,810
synchronization so cap cashing the data

507
00:30:50,270 --> 00:31:00,020
per minute to me it looks quite

508
00:30:53,810 --> 00:31:03,740
aggressive but that's that's on my view

509
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,540
so it's a it doesn't wait much but

510
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,850
that's just something we have to

511
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:16,520
understand how much Valley would be the

512
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:19,370
cache and what our I mean the impact of

513
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:25,190
one time zone server being offline or

514
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:27,530
sometimes they post suggested that being

515
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:32,150
in ninety nine plus nine ninety percent

516
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:36,500
would be something feasible and valuable

517
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:39,010
so not a huge constraint except for the

518
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:44,050
minutes that maybe a messenger

519
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:51,470
misunderstood minutes protocol changes

520
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:54,850
the time zone distribution does not it's

521
00:31:51,470 --> 00:32:00,350
not that you cannot retrieve the full

522
00:31:54,850 --> 00:32:00,689
data but there is no currently no no

523
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,480
wait

524
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:09,270
to retrieve the database because it's

525
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:11,250
only Jason and I don't know how if there

526
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:15,480
is a game to provide a full database

527
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:19,770
that versus said it passed in to Jason

528
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,630
so that's I think that's was some of the

529
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,740
protocol changes that have been

530
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:28,770
suggested and in any case the idea is to

531
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:32,730
be able to optimize the synchronization

532
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:36,150
process to the data we need I think

533
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:39,480
overall checking the leap second

534
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:45,600
consistency with NTP client I think

535
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:59,240
someone is jumping oh that's Mike so I'm

536
00:32:45,600 --> 00:33:01,740
finished okay can you hear me it's

537
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,540
there's no specific it doesn't

538
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:08,820
specifically have to be Jace Tommy TZ

539
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:12,470
just already delivers iCalendar and and

540
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,300
the new format that can cope with so

541
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,760
extending it to provide other data is

542
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:20,970
not not a big problem

543
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,379
oh yeah yeah yeah

544
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:28,020
so in any of these things we mentioned I

545
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:31,170
don't see any major issue is the main

546
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:35,520
issues that is not here today so that's

547
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:36,000
why it's my perception but Neil Neil

548
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,110
Jenkins

549
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,570
so who's the intended use of this not

550
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:46,649
directly to like end laptops or

551
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:49,379
something yeah so that's part of the

552
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:52,500
what I call the ecosystem that we need

553
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,330
to understand better before deploying

554
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,330
anything or asking someone else to

555
00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:01,949
deploy but there are two things either

556
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:04,620
it's your laptop or its time server your

557
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:07,260
laptop or let's say phone is being

558
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,179
connected to I mean a ninety percent

559
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,420
uptime is never gonna work

560
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:14,549
like the own initial startup it means

561
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,700
you won't have any cache data I need to

562
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,329
be

563
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:22,168
fetch it so that's at that point that

564
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:23,820
doesn't work so what doesn't work well

565
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:25,230
you mentioned that they thought 90%

566
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,480
availability will be fine because people

567
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:31,290
cache stuff oh that doesn't work if it's

568
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,050
their primary source as it would have to

569
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:36,929
be pre-loaded and then how out-of-date

570
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:39,359
is it I the other thing is that either

571
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:42,210
they I mean a single source that gets

572
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,859
pushed out everywhere immediately that

573
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:48,119
sounds like a movie plot scenario

574
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:52,159
waiting to go wrong just thought well

575
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,159
it's sort of that now except very slow

576
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,439
cameras and so the the thought behind

577
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:03,509
this was when there are those

578
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,760
last-minute changes to a time zone

579
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:08,430
because there's basically no lead time

580
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,700
given by the governing bodies that make

581
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:14,040
those decisions that rather than having

582
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,549
to wait from your OS vendor to roll up a

583
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,300
patch with the new time zone if the if I

584
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,160
Ana had a server which is unseating the

585
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,230
OS vendors whoever they might be then

586
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,839
your client just goes out and fetches

587
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,579
that from your from your vendor and it

588
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,049
could do that daily or you know once

589
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:34,349
every couple hours to see if there's any

590
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:37,980
new changes you know Jenkins again sure

591
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:40,470
but B you don't need the I on a server

592
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,640
bit for that like in changes so

593
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,290
infrequently as we said it would be

594
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,549
trivial for the OS vendor to have a

595
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,349
separate server they can just update

596
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,579
that it seems from there's not part of

597
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,319
their patch process which is the main

598
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:56,430
thing in that system not the fact that

599
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:58,109
there's not an ax so I hop in here with

600
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,390
the going back to that previous slide

601
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:02,759
where we said that they've been at most

602
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,000
eighteen updates for you part of the

603
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,260
reason for that yes that places can't

604
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,420
update immediately and guarantee that

605
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,099
every device will get it if you could

606
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,480
update your timezone and guarantee that

607
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,480
every device in the world would be

608
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,550
correct I suspect it might happen more

609
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,050
frequently so we don't want to encourage

610
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,050
governments to do silly things

611
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:36,099
so yeah anyway just in relation to

612
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:41,289
previous discussion having some protocol

613
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:43,089
or you know procedure on top of HTTP

614
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:45,969
with different media types to be

615
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:49,929
returned would be a service you know

616
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:52,989
good thing for ITF to do irrespective of

617
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:58,869
whether I am is involved in this sort of

618
00:36:52,989 --> 00:37:02,409
to follow up on your trans annex yeah I

619
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:05,589
do believe there's some effort to match

620
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:08,979
up these updates exactly because you

621
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:10,119
know there's you know some it's a fairly

622
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:12,459
heavyweight process for all the

623
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,979
consumers of it to push a new version to

624
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:17,049
their customers and whatnot and you know

625
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:19,058
there's certainly you know what they

626
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:21,369
refer to is the silly season of the

627
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:22,329
spring and fall and various people or

628
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,859
see their daylight savings time

629
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:24,909
transition coming up and aside now we're

630
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:28,058
going to move it by a week starting

631
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:30,069
tomorrow or whatever which would be you

632
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,569
know if if it were a lightweight lighter

633
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:32,889
weight processor updates to get push

634
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:37,359
they probably would be updates more

635
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:41,109
frequently I also wanted to say I feel

636
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:47,409
like given that that TZ dist is an HTTP

637
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:51,009
based protocol if this is not something

638
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:51,509
which you know a CDN could handle you

639
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:54,099
know

640
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:55,269
yes scaling out the ability of you know

641
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:56,889
eventually billions of people receiving

642
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:58,299
it we've done something wrong because

643
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:59,380
that's what they're good at especially

644
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:03,449
when we're talking about things that are

645
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,449
in the you know tens of kilobytes

646
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,390
and so a last point was about how to

647
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:21,310
authenticate the data provided by the

648
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:25,810
IANA because well so that that would

649
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:27,610
provide a means to do not authenticate

650
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:32,520
as a source you're retrieving the data

651
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:38,020
and so that might help to be able to

652
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:41,170
publish intermediary results so the

653
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:46,810
teaser database is on github so you have

654
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:49,930
to the commit also and then the other

655
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:54,250
thing is to be able to to authenticate

656
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:58,029
the data as well as what your publisher

657
00:38:54,250 --> 00:39:04,120
has been published I mean no tweaking to

658
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:08,620
that so I'm too much biased with DNS SEC

659
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:13,810
so I but that's the kind of things we

660
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:17,049
have to think about so some of the next

661
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:20,820
steps I think an important one would be

662
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,610
to to to bridge to reach the publishers

663
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:28,960
[Music]

664
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:31,120
maybe I did I didn't remember the second

665
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,600
bullet were there but let's go to the

666
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,120
third one to define a discuss a little

667
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,029
bit better what is with them the time

668
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,900
zone distribution system requirement the

669
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:47,200
users and so on and go to the protocol

670
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:51,220
the data because some of the metadata

671
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,040
have not yet being standardized and so

672
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:57,339
if there is significant interest we go

673
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:02,440
to the ID and proud we have a dedicated

674
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:05,470
working group can I ask ignorant

675
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,280
question and what I mean by publisher or

676
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:11,140
publishers

677
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:14,020
otherwise the the the time zone

678
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:17,140
distribution system your laptop or

679
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,870
mobile is connected to so it could be

680
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:23,109
Apple like right

681
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:25,269
okay so right so like

682
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:28,808
West vendors who are interested in

683
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:31,209
distributing this all right fine not

684
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:42,969
people trying to say you know change my

685
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:46,209
time zone in my country this is Barry my

686
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:50,440
preference would be for a small group

687
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:52,328
say a design team to just informally get

688
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,180
together start working on this make a

689
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:57,459
proposal and then think about whether we

690
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,890
should charter a working group based

691
00:40:57,459 --> 00:41:04,690
around that yeah yeah definitely I think

692
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:06,339
that's that yeah so I mean I'm I don't

693
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,890
see that the next target should be to

694
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:12,150
work on the working group but it's

695
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:14,499
rather to have these ongoing discussions

696
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:16,359
probably to do that across the two

697
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:21,538
mailing lists we have three mailing is

698
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:23,619
because it TZ TZ taste and calyx might I

699
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:25,809
mean we can live with that

700
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:27,519
well the right answer is to pick one of

701
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:30,459
those and have their discussions they're

702
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,410
not really in the roster three okay you

703
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:34,209
can you know socialize it on the three

704
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:36,848
working groups but pick one for the

705
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:41,249
discussion okay so that's probably on me

706
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:41,249
that yeah that makes sense

707
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,900
quick question

708
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,828
you just said three working groups what

709
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,420
other two working groups three mailing

710
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,809
lists whether the mailing lists where

711
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,609
this is gonna be fostering so you talked

712
00:41:55,809 --> 00:42:00,699
about I will let you know which is the

713
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:04,869
one but the three ones are cal eggs

714
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:07,959
which is calcified and one is time zone

715
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:21,569
distribution Biss and the other one is

716
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:21,569
time zone which is host by iana is the

717
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:30,999
so to quick what Aleksei just said on

718
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,849
the microphones so the remote

719
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:36,069
participants can hear probably the time

720
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:38,619
zone disc mailing list because

721
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:41,049
the one that's likely to be where the

722
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:44,670
discussion falls so if we make a working

723
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:49,630
rooms that's gonna be the Biss then yes

724
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:51,099
sorry Chuck time yeah okay that might

725
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,190
answer my question because we were

726
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:56,680
talking about in an earlier meeting this

727
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:59,829
week that we didn't want all this

728
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,629
discussion necessarily go on the mailing

729
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:06,400
list were there talking about changes

730
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:08,469
right okay okay but a pointer to the

731
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,699
discussion will be posted there so those

732
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:11,699
people know where it's happening

733
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:18,369
actually the tease that people were

734
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:28,119
excluding the two of the lists and

735
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:31,359
keeping you on discussing that okay so I

736
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:38,170
think it's Mike Brown do you have

737
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:41,319
anything to say forty said well what's

738
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,059
current is at least I have uploaded my

739
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,680
slides about the calculate stuff which

740
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:47,739
don't do in any other business at the

741
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:53,459
end if we have time okay good I think we

742
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:53,459
have time so I give the floor to Mike

743
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:06,779
okay good

744
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:17,469
don't have put my slides back up again

745
00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:21,180
hopefully this will be very quick Mike

746
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:21,180
looks distinctly different from hitting

747
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:37,020
some reason that I'm doing extensions

748
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,020
[Music]

749
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:49,600
okay these are just a remaining what I

750
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,580
think are the remaining issues and I

751
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:57,700
I've been dealt with you just slipped

752
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:59,620
the next slide so there was a lot of

753
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:04,960
discussion around my changes to the

754
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:06,759
source property I think and I I

755
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,890
suggested the rear I should probably do

756
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,050
is just drop that and use structured

757
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:16,000
data instead the whole intent of sauce

758
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:20,670
was to provide some other way a way to

759
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,080
to provide a link all the content of

760
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:25,750
something that was providing the data

761
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,740
for say a participant of e-card or

762
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,100
something of that kind

763
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:34,479
I think structured data actually works

764
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:36,069
fine for that so I suggested on the list

765
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,170
that I dropped that all these changes

766
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:42,340
and just use structured data I think I

767
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:44,860
got one response back so I think I think

768
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:50,680
that I think that's where I'm gonna go

769
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:52,000
with that and and whereas I thought we

770
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,950
were sort of done and then this whole

771
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,460
discussion started about structured data

772
00:45:53,950 --> 00:46:04,660
so I'd like to get that closed before I

773
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:06,760
move on and I think we probably need to

774
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,350
read justify the point of having

775
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:17,710
structured data as against using attach

776
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:19,930
it's the the problem with attachment

777
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,670
says he is first started we didn't

778
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:24,129
mention this in the spec when we talked

779
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:27,000
about this is it attached firstly only

780
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:30,270
allow the encoded data so you can have

781
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:37,390
unencoded data in the structured data

782
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:40,810
property it's I think it can raise the

783
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:43,029
point that some implementations have

784
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:46,240
measure tassel so they strip attachments

785
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:48,220
off and and just provide a pointer to

786
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,529
them we don't want that happening with

787
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:54,490
structured data it's really to be

788
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:56,410
carried along the thing and we didn't

789
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,240
want to extend attach anyway because

790
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,910
we're gonna run into some strengths

791
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,549
backward compatibility issues here so so

792
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:06,100
which in the end we decided a new

793
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:09,490
properly was a cleaner and easier way of

794
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,870
dealing with this and it's we've done

795
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,000
this kind of thing I did this kind of

796
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,650
thing before we even thought of

797
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,870
structured data for oasis

798
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,670
there is a need to transport a

799
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:21,310
well-defined payload

800
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,760
it may not be calendar data as such but

801
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:29,950
it's related it's something that is is a

802
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:33,460
is related to the event and so we

803
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:35,410
invented something in in Oasis for the

804
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,500
smart grid stuff but in fact out of his

805
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:40,660
structured data if that had been

806
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,810
appropriate if that had been around at

807
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:46,569
the time the the advantage of the thing

808
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:48,490
of having a schemer and was always that

809
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,800
clients can simply see what this

810
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,770
property is before they even pause it

811
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:58,450
and ignore it if they'd not interested

812
00:47:53,770 --> 00:48:00,610
it can also allows them to steer events

813
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:02,830
to different calendars if they recognize

814
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:06,430
was such as I think in the discussion

815
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:09,220
about what was it called the maintenance

816
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:12,100
thing that brought up the whole

817
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:15,069
structured data discussion that was one

818
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:17,440
of his requirements as as these events

819
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:19,330
come through they don't go straight into

820
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,400
a regular count or they get steered to a

821
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,830
different calendar and that's related to

822
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,490
maintenance you can recognize that from

823
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:30,700
the schema without actually parsing it

824
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:35,169
and that's I think is an advantage so

825
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,609
what was the next slide oh yeah and you

826
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,380
know there'd been a suggestion that we

827
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,120
should use a mind type instead of schema

828
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,640
and that attached already supported that

829
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,160
but that means we have to keep defining

830
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,410
mime types to map them onto schemas when

831
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,740
we already have a schema the mime type

832
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,660
doesn't define the the data model it

833
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:57,850
simply defines the way you represent it

834
00:48:52,660 --> 00:49:01,120
it's Jason or or XML or whatever and and

835
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:03,370
schema.org has a specific mime type for

836
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,859
their JSON data but then they have a

837
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:10,029
schema and yes I guess we could have

838
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:11,680
extended I attached to a schema but

839
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:15,090
again we've got backward compatibility

840
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,089
as Susan and the rest of it

841
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:21,240
and that's not to say you couldn't use

842
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,339
attach that's not to say you couldn't

843
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,049
use a mind type if that's inappropriate

844
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:27,450
and it's not to say you couldn't

845
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:29,339
redefine all this data as counter data

846
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:31,649
if again that seemed appropriate but a

847
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:32,009
lot of stuff for transport isn't counter

848
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:37,410
data

849
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:39,359
it's a payload and yeah and I guess my

850
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,040
last point was though we've been talking

851
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,660
about schema.org it wouldn't have to be

852
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,650
schema.org that could be defined

853
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:49,920
anywhere including in the IETF and the

854
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,290
the other the other point I was going to

855
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,180
make about this is there's a good

856
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:56,400
there's a big advantage to keeping all

857
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,859
this payload separate from counter data

858
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,310
we want to keep the model simple if we

859
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:04,680
start extending the eye calendar or the

860
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,970
j/s calendar or whatever data model

861
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,980
every time we want to transport

862
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,589
something it's gonna get ridiculously

863
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,990
complicated and and it's simply not

864
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:14,849
necessary we don't have to absorb

865
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:17,328
everything into the data model we just

866
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:22,800
need to recognize with transporting data

867
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:26,240
along with the event so that's that

868
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:29,240
really is allowed to say like any

869
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,240
comments

870
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,430
I mean I guess the question I have is do

871
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:41,950
we just go ahead as as things stand with

872
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:43,649
the the current spec I mean I think this

873
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:48,850
discussion opened up a load of questions

874
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:50,860
I think that we're fine as we are other

875
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:53,410
than removing the source I'm ready with

876
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:59,770
the next question the draft how do

877
00:50:53,410 --> 00:51:02,500
others feel someone is at the mic okay

878
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:05,200
hi Mike this is Michelle from my Anna um

879
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:09,730
I just had a really quick question in

880
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:13,569
our tracker we did an expert review with

881
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:16,060
Cyrus stubby and he said that there is

882
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:18,250
still an issue that needs to be

883
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:20,620
addressed by the author and you did he

884
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:23,500
spoke with are you were you the author

885
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:27,609
yes yes okay so he said he spoke with

886
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:29,470
you but he did say that the there were

887
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,240
some remaining issues that needed

888
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:35,350
discussion and feedback from the working

889
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:38,649
group list and so I think that's just

890
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:41,110
one part of preventing Ayana from saying

891
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:44,440
okay just curious of what you discussed

892
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:47,200
here if that's part of what Cyrus had a

893
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,980
problem with and has it been fixed or is

894
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:54,310
that still yeah yeah yes the I think

895
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:56,950
I've got a draft ready which covers a

896
00:51:54,310 --> 00:52:01,630
lot of the points he talked about were

897
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:04,060
to do with the the a B and F issues on

898
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:06,760
the rest of it but he did one of his big

899
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:10,150
problems was was sauce and how that was

900
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,910
being extended and so that this is what

901
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:14,950
sort of triggered my thoughts about that

902
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:18,430
and with the other comments people have

903
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:20,939
made about sauce I'd say in the end it

904
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:23,049
occurred me structured data was was a

905
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,810
perfectly reasonable way to do what I

906
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:28,060
was trying to do with sauce and so I I

907
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,620
think I've addressed all his his

908
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,560
comments I do need to go back and go

909
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:35,049
through the list but I suddenly went

910
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,549
through his list of comments okay just

911
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:40,649
making sure thank you okay

912
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,649
[Music]

913
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,850
probably needs another check with our

914
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:54,759
response there is a new draft version

915
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:57,569
yes I I would like him to another go

916
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,570
over it yes

917
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,848
King and um any other questions feedback

918
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:21,970
Neil Jenkins

919
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,710
I'm Smith I've only skimmed the staff

920
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:26,490
and followed the main list they're more

921
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,930
loosely on the other things but the main

922
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:30,848
contentious point has been whether

923
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:32,348
something should be attached or whether

924
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:34,440
structured data is useful as an

925
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:45,240
alternative to that is that right right

926
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:47,800
yes yes or even if you should be having

927
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:52,240
payloads of this kind anyway I mean part

928
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:55,960
of the suggestions it's all these Miriam

929
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,970
specified as I count problem I agree

930
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,849
that I think as far as icon properties

931
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:03,430
is overkill and makes everything way

932
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:04,510
more complicated and it's necessary

933
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,480
especially when there are existing

934
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:09,910
schemas like the ones you reference you

935
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:14,079
so I I do I would strongly disagree with

936
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:17,379
that as a solution I think what's

937
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:22,470
happening is fine I can see how you

938
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:22,470
could embed them as attach things but

939
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,440
it's hard to how to like quantify but it

940
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,270
does feel different enough that

941
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,530
embedding it as you don't know

942
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:32,500
structured data seems like a reasonable

943
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:37,480
solution to me I I would say that for

944
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:40,839
going forward with chairs calendar we

945
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,190
should perhaps maybe we could we

946
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:44,920
wouldn't have the backward compatibility

947
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:47,530
issues I mean the to us are close you

948
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:51,970
know just this generic attachment and

949
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:54,190
and this this payload we could probably

950
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,779
combine the two andreas calendar because

951
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:59,290
we can move forward and we could

952
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:02,770
distinguish between the things and that

953
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:04,599
may be worth thinking about but I think

954
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:06,099
if I counter to avoid backward

955
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:11,710
compatibility issues in the rest of it

956
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:13,030
this makes more sense new him yeah well

957
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,650
with the chairs Condor you have a nice

958
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:17,109
thing is these scheme of things have in

959
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:18,880
JSON as well so you could just embed

960
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:20,680
them in Tripoli and

961
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,610
that's a definite advantage of the

962
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,440
attaches you're not having to pass

963
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:27,190
anything again it's just reading further

964
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,110
properties but also yes they are not

965
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,370
part of the Jay's calendar thing you're

966
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:32,050
not finding new properties for every

967
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,220
single one of these things so it

968
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:35,880
certainly makes a lot of sense in that

969
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,879
context I think

970
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:56,459
any other so do we expect it struck my

971
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:01,900
understanding is that this draft is

972
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:05,829
almost done is it am i cracked yes I I I

973
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:07,480
should go over the Syrus points once

974
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:10,119
more just to make sure I caught all of

975
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,099
those and I've already got with the

976
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:15,099
source stuff removed so I think I'm

977
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:20,400
ready to submit another draft and

978
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:20,400
hopefully that'll be close to it okay

979
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:28,900
we're making good progress and then I

980
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:31,869
think Brown that's your presentation yes

981
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:33,940
hello I just slept this together last

982
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:37,450
night cuz you know being organized and

983
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:39,880
all that this is just I guess a a primer

984
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:42,098
for anyone who doesn't know what's with

985
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,470
Cal Connect which I suspect is pretty

986
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:46,690
much nobody here but also letting people

987
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:48,848
know the dates of the next Cal Connect

988
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,540
meeting and inviting people so if we

989
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:54,310
could go to the next slide please

990
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:56,200
so a bit of background on Cal Connect it

991
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,640
was set up to allow companies who are

992
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,828
working on new products to test an

993
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,960
interoperability without the public

994
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:03,430
relations problem of the whole world

995
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,520
knowing what they're working on and and

996
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,200
starting to harass them about it we've

997
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,480
now moved to meeting just twice a year

998
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,279
so we're meeting October in Philadelphia

999
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,970
and then it will be in San Francisco and

1000
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:19,450
I think April so moving to a six months

1001
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:21,279
league schedule the I put the link in

1002
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,230
here to the minutes from the last time

1003
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,010
we met which was a video chat from the

1004
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:29,710
calculate session in Bedford for Telex

1005
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,990
members so joining we didn't have very

1006
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:34,030
many people but some will do the same

1007
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:36,669
thing again so that we can have

1008
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:42,099
calculate people mate hopefully as well

1009
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:44,890
a next slide place we store public

1010
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:46,510
drafts in github from Cal Connect there

1011
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:49,660
are many documents there in various

1012
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:51,520
states the documents Mike and Ken have

1013
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,859
been talking about have been cherry

1014
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,660
picked out of there s the ones which we

1015
00:57:53,859 --> 00:57:58,690
think her in good enough said to bring

1016
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:00,580
to IOT F some things there we've looked

1017
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,920
at and said they've either

1018
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,630
they've died in the meantime no one's

1019
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,290
interested in them or they've been

1020
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:12,310
subsumed into joyous calendar but there

1021
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:13,750
is additional work there in some cases

1022
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,940
it's things that have been in the wild

1023
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,220
for years and so we're going to try and

1024
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,080
bring those ones to ATF as informational

1025
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,049
standards subtlest there is a public

1026
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:25,810
document that's in a fixed place that

1027
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:28,960
people can come and see how random stuff

1028
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,430
they see on the wire actually works next

1029
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,410
slide

1030
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:35,649
yep so the other thing that Cal connects

1031
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:38,170
working on is contacts the jeaious

1032
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:40,720
contact specification is over in

1033
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:43,390
dispatch didn't manage to get dispatched

1034
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,279
at the last IGF and we're not quite

1035
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:47,009
there for this HF but we found a

1036
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,870
co-author and that's moving forwards

1037
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:52,360
this additional work on vCard happening

1038
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:55,180
and over the last year Cal Connect

1039
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,750
became a member of ISO and is working

1040
00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:02,140
you know ISO on the dates and name

1041
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:03,550
standards which we'll need for that the

1042
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,740
last thing of course is that we are keen

1043
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,340
to get additional people working on this

1044
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,080
at the moment

1045
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:10,480
ken and Mike are taking all the

1046
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,279
documents as he saw the event Pub Mike

1047
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,640
basically took a document that was

1048
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:18,130
originally written by an author at Apple

1049
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:20,620
and has been shepherding it since then

1050
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,540
we'd love to have more people come in

1051
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:25,960
and volunteer to work on these documents

1052
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:28,270
the main thing that delays our bandwidth

1053
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,010
is reviewer time within this group but

1054
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:34,360
also the number of authors that we have

1055
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:37,330
available so if anyone in this group or

1056
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:39,280
anyone they know any junior people who

1057
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:41,049
would love to get their name on an RFC

1058
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,910
and get more experience this is a great

1059
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:47,380
place for anyone with calendar

1060
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:49,770
experience to get involved that's not

1061
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,770
what I've got

1062
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:00,520
and those people are like so as I recall

1063
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:02,230
I have a discuss open on the event pub

1064
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,050
document I suppose I should have brought

1065
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:06,820
up when Michael was talking but I wasn't

1066
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:08,860
thinking that we were supposed to

1067
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:10,600
discuss with the Cal connect people so

1068
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,980
that ought to be on the agenda for the

1069
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,440
joint meeting this time I thought it was

1070
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:16,900
supposed to be on the joint meeting

1071
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:20,170
agenda for the last time but it has to

1072
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:23,500
do with the extensive use of URIs or

1073
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:26,170
this extensive option of putting URI Xin

1074
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:28,540
in the event pop stuff and and my

1075
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:30,910
concern about URIs that get

1076
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:33,910
automatically resolved by calendar

1077
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:35,830
clients and what that can do when you

1078
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:38,649
have URIs that can be militia that can

1079
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:40,120
point to malicious things so that's a

1080
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:44,910
discussion we need to have somewhere

1081
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,910
either here or with Cal Connect during

1082
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:51,520
Neil Jenkins

1083
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:55,810
that's just reminding me Barry thanks

1084
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:58,390
that's a very good point in that due to

1085
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:03,670
privacy concerns of IP addresses and

1086
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:05,230
local information we fast mail and know

1087
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,850
a lot of other companies are moving

1088
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:08,740
towards anything like that as embedded

1089
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:10,960
we fetch fire our servers and proxy like

1090
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,220
within an email any images or things

1091
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,630
that you want to load for the user we do

1092
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:17,379
on their behalf so that it's not leaking

1093
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:18,430
their IPs and cookies we would have to

1094
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,110
start doing the same thing stuff in

1095
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:22,779
calendar events and we can do that but

1096
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,890
it increases the risk of those kind of

1097
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,420
privacy leaks and makes it harder

1098
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,490
whereas the structured data thing

1099
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,690
suffice must be embed it makes a lot

1100
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,310
easier because there isn't an external

1101
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:33,250
thing you have to fetch in order to be

1102
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:35,590
able to display it right and pointing

1103
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:38,830
out that a lot of times these kinds of

1104
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:41,170
you our eyes are customized per user so

1105
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,940
as soon as you fetch it that identifies

1106
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:46,590
the user that it had been sent to so

1107
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,590
yeah there's lots of issues here

1108
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:53,049
Kember just an unrelated point just a

1109
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:54,910
correction the April 20 20 Cal Connect

1110
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:58,900
meeting will be in the UK not in San

1111
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:59,670
Francisco so they're going to the right

1112
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,630
continent

1113
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:03,630
[Laughter]

1114
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:19,680
so if there are no other comments

1115
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:25,559
well thank you brown for staying online

1116
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:28,919

1117
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:35,759

1118
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:39,119
me now ok and I think we can adjourn the

1119
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:40,279
meeting so thank you very much and see

1120
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:48,410

1121
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:48,410
in the interim meeting oh we didn't have
