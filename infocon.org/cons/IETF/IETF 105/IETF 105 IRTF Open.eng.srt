1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,310
this is the IRT F open meeting if

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,539
someone at the back could could pull the

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,779
doors in please that would be

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,779
appreciated

5
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:40,300
all right so thank you welcome everybody

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:45,339
this is the IRT F open meeting my name

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:50,019
is Colin Perkins I'm the IRT F chair we

8
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:51,909
have a bunch of things today quick

9
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:55,120
introduction and status update to get us

10
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:57,089
started then we have a short update from

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,280
the information centric networking

12
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:03,070
research group talking about the CC NX

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,119
RFC's and then we'll spend the majority

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,190
of the time today with two really

15
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,460
excellent talks from the applied

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,590
networking research prize with meta

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:19,119
Rosen's Schiff sitting in the front here

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:23,500
to start with talking about MTP and a

19
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,810
new NTP client called Chronos and TJ

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:38,680
Chung at the end talking about the role

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:41,649
of registrar's in DNS is this better

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,180
yes okay excellent all right it's it's

23
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:44,469
even more actually from where I'm

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,500
sitting but if it's better for you

25
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:51,280
that's good okay so this is the IRT F

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,759
open meeting the IRT F as a reminder is

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,759
a parallel organization to the IETF

28
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,939
which focuses on the longer-term

29
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,530
research issues we got a bunch of

30
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,779
mailing lists which you may consider

31
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,210
joining we've got an announcements list

32
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,899
which is pretty low volume and a

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,220
discussion list and with the the IETF a

34
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,239
dog website which has all the

35
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:19,390
information about the organization we do

36
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,820
free types of things in the IRT F we've

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,369
got a bunch of research groups of which

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,660
there are 11 full research groups and

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,910
free proposed research groups we cover a

40
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,329
pretty full range of the possible

41
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,090
subjects from the crypto forum group all

42
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:38,620
the way through to quantum Internet

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,930
network measurements information centric

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,439
networking Human Rights global access

45
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,099
and

46
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,969
the groups in dark green fall research

47
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,640
groups the ones in light green and grey

48
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:55,950
proposed research groups we let new

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,958
research groups run for a year see if

50
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,578
the things are working and if so they

51
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,370
think it charted as a full research

52
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:05,519
group the coin group had its first

53
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,000
meeting in Prague the competition in the

54
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,299
network group looked reading some really

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,989
nice stuff I mean network computing the

56
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:18,450
privacy enhancements group will be

57
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,310
having their third meeting later this

58
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,459
week and I expect their transition to a

59
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,200
full research group shortly after that

60
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,840
the quantum internet group who are not

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,328
meeting this time had a really nice

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,000
tutorial in Prague which I understood

63
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:37,340
not a word of about quantum quantum

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,889
Internet and the quantum physics the

65
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,590
physics behind what it needs to build a

66
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,480
quantum link and look to be doing some

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,040
really nice work that they're

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,750
alternating their meetings between here

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,260
and quantum physics conferences so

70
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,790
they're not meeting this time we also

71
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,120
have the applied networking research

72
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,858
workshop which ran yesterday we had a

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,780
couple hundred people in attendance a

74
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:05,250
bunch of really nice papers this is a

75
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,459
conference we organized in conjunction

76
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,019
with ACM sitcom proceedings are

77
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,599
published in the ACM digital library

78
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,129
it's a peer reviewed or workshop we got

79
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,399
some really nice papers which are all on

80
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,500
the website and we hope to do this all

81
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,849
again next year still a little bit

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,400
provisional but hopefully this will be

83
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,380
running again in the summer ITF in

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,239
Madrid next year so look out for the

85
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,949
call for papers around Christmas time

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,710
just after and finally we have the

87
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:38,220
applied networking research prize which

88
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,780
is awarded for some results in recent

89
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,120
results in applied networking research

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,638
and we'll have the two talks which would

91
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,310
comprise the majority of this session

92
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,900
talking about NTP security and checking

93
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,720
out DNS SEC deployment

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,960
there'll be a couple more NRP talks at

95
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,810
iit f-106 in singapore and we'll be

96
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,710
opening nominations for the 2020 awards

97
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,840
come October November time so if you've

98
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,130
read any good applied networking

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,479
research papers keeping them in mind

100
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,890
we'd appreciate your nominations later

101
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:18,780
in the year okay so that's all I have to

102
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:22,680
say before we move on to the ANR paper

103
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:45,989
talks we just have a short talk if I can

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:47,790
find it on C CNX thank you so my name is

105
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,070
well he's pulling them up my name is

106
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,250
Mark Moscow I'm the principal author and

107
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:58,340
the two experimental aspects that just

108
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,340
got released for CCN X from the ICN RG

109
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:24,379
okay there we go so the there were two

110
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:27,139
documents released as part of this

111
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,389
protocol the versus the 85 69 the

112
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,309
semantics document which describes the

113
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,080
behavior and the meaning of the

114
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:36,759
different fields and then there's an

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:41,748
encoding document 80 609 which uses a

116
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:45,020
mostly TLV format to encode the protocol

117
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:48,020
messages so for those of you who don't

118
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,568
know CC NX is one of the IC energy

119
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,539
information centric networking protocols

120
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:55,399
and the idea here is that you do

121
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,580
something to name the data that you're

122
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:01,449
requesting and you can use that name in

123
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,369
fetching the data so you're not doing

124
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:07,209
quite host-to-host networking you're

125
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:12,439
trying to get something by its content

126
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:14,689
and this was first proposed in 2009 and

127
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,860
went under a significant revision

128
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:21,379
beginning in 2014 the first drafts I

129
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,930
think were submitted in 2016 so it's

130
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:30,199
been kind of a long march for these

131
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:33,860
specifications and just to give you one

132
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,990
of the high level use cases it's an

133
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,509
interest and responsible request

134
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,149
response protocol so I can ask for some

135
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:45,139
name like example.com / photo dot

136
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:47,059
manifest and I can specify the key that

137
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,860
the publisher used to publish this and

138
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:52,009
the network can ensure that I get three

139
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,639
that I get the data that I asked for and

140
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:58,669
then we can do tricks with how to fetch

141
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:04,009
data by hash based naming once you have

142
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:06,498
a manifest for that data there are four

143
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:09,189
principal implementations that are going

144
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:12,169
right now one is called community ICN

145
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:15,199
and this is the Linux Foundation work

146
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:16,878
and this is meant to be a fairly high

147
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,289
speed implementation that uses vector

148
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,209
packet packet processing CCN light which

149
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,159
is a widely used implementation

150
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:29,970
especially on smaller platforms

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,940
and see for this is from the National

152
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,830
Research Institute of Japan and this has

153
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,900
also simulator an emulator modules

154
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:42,620
available for it so all of these are

155
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:47,699
based on the CC and XR FCS hybrid ICN

156
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:51,020
looks at integrating name based name

157
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,720
based routing into the ipv6 address

158
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:58,560
space so between the eyepiece ipv6

159
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,350
address and the transport address it's

160
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,380
kind of fully integrates so it's not

161
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:07,560
really an overlay it's an integration

162
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,420
thank you very much okay thank you maybe

163
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,989
have time for one quick question if

164
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,610
anyone has one it's a nice nice piece of

165
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,480
work just finishing up from the ICN

166
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,320
group thank you

167
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,320
okay thank you

168
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,470
okay so the first of the two applied

169
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,620
networking research prize-winning talks

170
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,060
is NATO Rosen chef from the Hebrew

171
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,800
University in Jerusalem who'll be

172
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:23,719
talking about preventing Network time

173
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:26,390
travel with r2 and protect NTP with the

174
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,200
host is a joint work with O majority I

175
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:33,230
need to live and make us appear so NTP

176
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,600
networking protocol you it is used to a

177
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,460
synchronous time across computer over

178
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,300
the Internet I guess you all know I'm

179
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:44,360
how many port O'Call is many application

180
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,550
we learn eight such as TLS DNS HTTP

181
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:52,400
cables and many financial of

182
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:54,380
applications in a nutshell NTP is the

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,970
client-server architecture consists of

184
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,370
two main processes purposes and

185
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,300
selection process so for example if we

186
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:06,170
have we have one client that in the

187
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,560
process and ntp queries two three NTP

188
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,050
servers gets an NTP responses from the

189
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,500
NTP servers and then in the selection

190
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,359
process the best time samples are

191
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,410
selected and used in order to update the

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,210
client clock however NTP is highly

193
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,920
vulnerable to time shifting attacks

194
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:29,210
especially made by man-in-the-middle

195
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,990
attack Yahoo who have a control over

196
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:38,450
this section between client and one of

197
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:40,700
the NDP service and for example in the

198
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,220
previous one let's assume without loss

199
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,650
of generality that the man in the middle

200
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,700
control the section between the client

201
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:51,500
and the left and P server men in the

202
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,440
middle of talking contempor ntp

203
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,450
responses he can impact the local clock

204
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,400
of the client by simply dropping on

205
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,430
delay in packets that is why encryption

206
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,560
and authentication are insufficient here

207
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,260
and he can make the client believed that

208
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,030
his sample is the best one and he should

209
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,500
follow

210
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,310
previous studies even consider

211
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,899
man-in-the-middle

212
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,189
it's too strong for it to be but why is

213
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:19,430
ntp so vulnerable to man in the middle

214
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:21,319
anyway as we said before and B consists

215
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,219
of two main processes for process and

216
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:27,410
selection process in the poll process

217
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,180
then P relies on a very small set of

218
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,550
servers and they're often

219
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,248
Dinah's cached which means that the

220
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,279
attacker only needs mental capabilities

221
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:40,059
with respect of few and TP server in

222
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,649
order to maintain his TUC over time and

223
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,930
the ntp selection process algorithms

224
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:47,930
assume that in currency are rare and

225
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,029
well distributed around a you to see the

226
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,128
correct time

227
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,629
that is why profile and sophisticated

228
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:58,069
man-in-the-middle attack again can

229
00:12:53,629 --> 00:13:02,059
bypass this algorithm and he's beyond

230
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:05,180
the scope of traditional treatments in

231
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:09,139
order to face these limitations and we

232
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:13,849
suggest modified and to be client called

233
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:16,459
homes it has the foreign characteristics

234
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,829
it has provable security we can bound

235
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,809
the probability of successful time

236
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:24,229
shifting attacks even made by man in the

237
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:25,730
middle attack here we can make what come

238
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,040
ability since there is no need to change

239
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,750
anything in the server side only small

240
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,959
and limit changes are needed in this

241
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,000
Indian client side and we add only low

242
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,239
computational and communication overhead

243
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,879
since eventually with query only few NTP

244
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,819
servers so in order to prove that

245
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,920
harness actually protect NTP we need to

246
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:47,689
define our tweet model so we assume that

247
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,910
the attacker have full control of a

248
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:52,309
large function of the NTP service sake

249
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,920
Porter we also assume that he is capable

250
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:57,319
of both modifying the content of the NTP

251
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,319
response and the timing when it's going

252
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,849
to arrive to the client and finally we

253
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:04,160
assume that he is malicious and try to

254
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:08,029
shift the clients clock as much as

255
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,620
possible so how Hollis is built on the

256
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,790
one hand we will lie on many and to be

257
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,459
server we serve as a we generate a large

258
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,170
several hundred of servers per client in

259
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:21,109
order to raise the trishul needed by the

260
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,069
attacker to attack on the other hand

261
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,500
require only few servers

262
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:29,760
only terms of them are choosing at

263
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,500
random in order to avoid NTP overloading

264
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,019
and DP servers are overloading and

265
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,510
finally we use smart filtering in order

266
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,910
to remove outliers and make it hard to

267
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:44,120
them many de mantequilla to contaminate

268
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:47,360
with chosen samples so now out of the

269
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,790
the pool I am informally going to

270
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,850
describe how we update our clock so out

271
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:56,699
of hundred of servers in the pool we

272
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,940
choose tenth of them at random then we

273
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:03,149
ordered them from low to high we remove

274
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,730
the de lowest and the highest time

275
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:11,250
samples and take a look at the remaining

276
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:12,870
sets and then we ask two questions we

277
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,209
have two conditions the first one is

278
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,490
rather their samples in the remaining

279
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,829
set are close to each other and the

280
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,920
other condition is rather their average

281
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:25,849
is close to the clients clock if both of

282
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,459
these conditions are satisfied then we

283
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:34,980
use the average of the remaining set as

284
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:37,800
the new clients cook otherwise we were

285
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,680
sample and again out of 100 of servers

286
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,810
tenants are choosing its run and chosen

287
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,870
at random and we dropped it from each

288
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,819
side could be for example one third and

289
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,180
particularly there were many certain

290
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,949
stand and tests the two conditions

291
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,739
whether they're close to each other and

292
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:58,829
rather than an average is close to the

293
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,990
clients cook if you fail we try again

294
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:03,420
and again and again and again until we

295
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,730
fail k times and then we move to the

296
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,860
panic mode where we sample all the

297
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:16,199
server's dropped D for example one third

298
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:20,000
for me to sign and take the new time of

299
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,000
the client as the average

300
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,639
so first I'm going to present our

301
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,368
security guarantees and then I will

302
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,049
describe our security analysis so

303
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:34,480
essentially what we are showing in our

304
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:37,569
paper is that shifting time each one

305
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,600
client by at least 100 millisecond from

306
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:42,729
the UTC will take the attacker at least

307
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,279
22 years in expectation and this is when

308
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,929
we consider an extreme case were out of

309
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,519
507 in the pool seventh of whom are

310
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:55,319
fully controlled by the attacker

311
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,179
we also aquarii 15 servers per hour and

312
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,799
we saw that these samples are within 25

313
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:02,589
millisecond from the UTC we call this

314
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,869
disparity Omega and these parameters

315
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,329
derived from an experiment that we

316
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:10,599
conducted on Amazon servers both in

317
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,168
Europe and in the US and here you can

318
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:18,668
see the benefit of using cones over day

319
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:21,039
the current ntp as a function of exists

320
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,649
and the number of servers that are

321
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,189
quality repair update and where each

322
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:29,350
line here and I present a different

323
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:34,059
ratio of the malicious server in the

324
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:36,639
pool so consider pool for 500 servers AP

325
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:39,279
function of which are fully controlled

326
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:41,949
by the attacker and now we compute the

327
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,289
attacker probability of success and for

328
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,600
time-shifting attack both in the

329
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:48,850
traditional NTP client and in

330
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,469
horizontally client we plot the ratio

331
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,189
between these probabilities and this is

332
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,649
the warnings so if we consider the last

333
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,210
scenario when we have out of 500 several

334
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:00,820
segments or more fully controlled by the

335
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,830
attacker we can say that using course

336
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,149
improve the security by a factor of

337
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,980
1,000 and notice that device is no great

338
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:12,789
week and that is why the improvement is

339
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,309
exponential and now we are going to

340
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:18,490
describe our security analysis so in

341
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:22,149
order to do so we have to look at all

342
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,210
the scenario that can happen which

343
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:28,260
depends on the number of malicious

344
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,970
samples that we queried

345
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,629
and see how cornice is handling them of

346
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,000
course we take their words and I say my

347
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:40,620
they it was kiss another salami and the

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,780
first an iron is when the number of the

349
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,719
good samples is d as you remember out of

350
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,520
hundreds of servers we chose m tents at

351
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,059
random and then we drop D form each side

352
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:55,539
so in the first scenario we have the

353
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:57,910
number of good samples denoted as yellow

354
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:00,658
in shown is higher than D and then there

355
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:05,110
are more malicious samples denoted as

356
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:07,720
Diamond is less than a minus D so we

357
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,639
have to our option here because the

358
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,919
first one is when we have only a

359
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,080
malicious sample remaining in our

360
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,659
remaining set however we have more than

361
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,610
the good samples right so we have at

362
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:20,760
least one good sample in each side of

363
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,408
the remaining set which means and and

364
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,750
good samples are within Omega way from

365
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:28,270
the UTC from the correct time that is

366
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:33,580
why the remaining set samples should be

367
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:35,200
also closed today due to C and your

368
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,320
averages wheels in order to update our

369
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,700
clock eventually it's close to duty see

370
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,039
the second option is when we have at

371
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,500
least one good sample inside our

372
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,950
remaining set however according to our

373
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,539
second first condition all the samples

374
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,809
in the remaining set should be close to

375
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:54,340
each other otherwise we were some so if

376
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:56,320
we know that we have at least one good

377
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,289
sample in the remaining set and it's

378
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,939
closed today you see the others should

379
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:03,220
be close to 8 which means that their

380
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,620
average also will be close to the UTC

381
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,799
and this is why we can say that these

382
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,330
attack strategies are unaffected the

383
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,889
second scenario is when the number of

384
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:16,960
good samples is equal less than D and

385
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,679
the number of malicious or else is a

386
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,690
high or equal to a minus D in the worst

387
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,590
case we have only malicious servers

388
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,860
remaining and they are not bounded by

389
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:32,428
good samples however according to our

390
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,928
second condition their average which we

391
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:37,059
finally use in order to update our clock

392
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,270
should be close to the client slope

393
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,540
which means

394
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,820
there is a boundary on the time shift

395
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,460
that we allow here

396
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,649
moreover the probability of this kind of

397
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,100
a scenario is extremely low

398
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:54,710
why because it requires the malicious

399
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,300
symbols to be randomly chosen in much

400
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,730
higher rate than the rate in the

401
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,030
population and of course repeated shifts

402
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,800
is a probability is negligible this is

403
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:09,160
why we can say the significant time

404
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:12,500
shift here is approximately infeasible

405
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,010
but even if we cannot really shift the

406
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,950
plants clock maybe we can create another

407
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:20,960
kind of attack let's say you know a

408
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,680
service so how can how can we do that

409
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,470
and if we have more than deep malicious

410
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,740
server isn't less than a mine and minus

411
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,170
D good servers good good sample sorry

412
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,840
then we have at least one malicious

413
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:42,350
sample that remain in our remaining set

414
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:44,149
right so it can violate for example the

415
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,159
first condition saying that all the

416
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:50,330
samples should be close to each other

417
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:52,520
and then because to example or something

418
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,409
again and again and again we get to the

419
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,520
panic mode when we ask all them

420
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:05,330
severally in the the pool and maybe

421
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:08,420
multiple resembling by multiple clients

422
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:15,080
Crossland may cause denial servers over

423
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:17,300
the NTP servers however we can prove

424
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,429
that even for low penetrance hold k

425
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:23,090
equals 3 which means that only after

426
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:25,370
three failures you move to the panic

427
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,889
mode and ask all the services in the

428
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:30,649
pool the probability of success is

429
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,190
negligible which means that the it will

430
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:37,910
take the attacker decades to force

431
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:42,410
penico on one server one

432
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm sorry um and wonder when we compare

433
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:48,320
between cornice and om TPD we see that

434
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,650
almost using greater variety of samples

435
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,929
server over time if you have possible

436
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,170
security guarantees as as I presented

437
00:22:53,930 --> 00:23:02,360
and it's a void there ntp source quality

438
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:04,940
and filters this is why it may be it is

439
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,330
possible that verse that there is an

440
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:12,560
adverse effect on its precision and a

441
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,810
currency so in order to improve the

442
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,510
precision without of course sacrificing

443
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:21,590
kana security we introduced a smelling

444
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:25,250
mechanism and that the thing that we

445
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:27,850
favor the minimum a sample of that out

446
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,040
of order of setting the remaining self

447
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:34,090
if it's close to the to the average of

448
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,500
sense we evaluate comes with the

449
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,889
smoothing mechanism in multiplication

450
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,930
both in Europe and in the US for example

451
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,810
this is the results from Oregon where

452
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,570
you can see in the x-axis is the average

453
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,389
offset and in the y-axis is the photo

454
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,530
the fluctuation the average of the

455
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:58,190
derivative each dot here we present

456
00:23:53,530 --> 00:24:01,129
through 30 minutes experiment that

457
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,790
conduct in each of these algorithms and

458
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:08,150
we compare NTP in a blue dot to horse

459
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:11,379
with them the smooth mechanism in the

460
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:14,540
red dots and we can see here that

461
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,060
essentially the average offsets are

462
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,790
close to each other but both in ntp

463
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:25,280
adding corners and there is no much

464
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:28,010
fluctuation both of them so to conclude

465
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,410
ntp is a highly vulnerable to any time

466
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,300
computation shift again tax and even

467
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:37,040
attack here who controls even few

468
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:39,830
section between server and a servers and

469
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,379
client can shift the french time so we

470
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,480
presented a modified Antipa client

471
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,130
called horns with provable security

472
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,670
Mequon calm ability and low overhead and

473
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,580
we also shown that

474
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,090
precision and offset are very close to

475
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,799
the NTP

476
00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:03,809
around two millisecond apart and this is

477
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:06,210
the research the further research so we

478
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:08,700
come we continue to evaluate concept

479
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:12,750
scale security precision accountancy

480
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:15,090
overhead etc and we also working on

481
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,270
standardized and closed in the relevant

482
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:21,840
a working group and we would like to

483
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,700
extend Hollis to address several attack

484
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,949
strategies and of course we would like

485
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,750
to extend for us to maybe other time

486
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:32,970
synchronization protocol such as PTP and

487
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:37,470
here you can see that they're linked to

488
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:42,990
both our paper published in and and this

489
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:56,910
s and our last IDF draft thank you very

490
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:59,669
much okay any questions hi I'm Stuart

491
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,299
chair from Apple this is important work

492
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:05,040
thank you I have little tip if you put

493
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:09,179
numbers on the slides it makes it easier

494
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,649
to ask questions so I don't know I don't

495
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,360
know what the slide number was but early

496
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,559
in the presentation you had a graph

497
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,199
showing how the probability improves as

498
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,389
the sample size improves which makes

499
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,260
perfect sense but it was kind of a

500
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:28,490
staircase shape and I was puzzled what

501
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:35,549
is the intuition why it's not a

502
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:38,010
monotonic increase in security it seems

503
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:42,389
like going from 14 to 18 it gets worse

504
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:46,590
and then it improves at 20 this is just

505
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:49,530
an estimation and effect but basically

506
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:53,250
we are because there corn NTP uses

507
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:56,020
between 4 & 6 servers we didn't really

508
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:59,680
calculate before

509
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:03,820
so this is the answer about why is it

510
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:06,640
get worse and a white straight line and

511
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:10,230
not really increasing then and the

512
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,650
answer is that we would like to to

513
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:16,450
remove deform h side d was a once there

514
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,580
and we wanted to do to be an integer

515
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:22,170
number so this is why you can see there

516
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:25,000
it stares so is the conclusion that

517
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:28,830
querying eight servers actually gives

518
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,830
you better results than querying twelve

519
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:37,720
no kind of a straight line but I think

520
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:45,280
it's an optical illusion so those lines

521
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:49,990
are horizontal are they okay it's it's a

522
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:54,720
flat plateau I get it now okay and what

523
00:27:49,990 --> 00:28:00,880
we can see here is that even if you

524
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:04,810
sample only servers are kind of your

525
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:09,400
time then still honest and improve the

526
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:12,310
content EP by a factor of 100 hi Wes

527
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,950
hurt occur I say um good work I love

528
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,149
seeing a good statistical analysis of

529
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,200
your security likelihood I think that's

530
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,730
great

531
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,790
and it looks like it's a feasible

532
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,520
solution with one exception so I assume

533
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,659
it sounds like you don't try and handle

534
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,670
man-in-the-middle type attacks where you

535
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,430
have an attacker very close to you that

536
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:34,600
can almost respond to most NTP servers

537
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:36,730
right so that thank you exactly yeah

538
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,399
it's like if we control my gateway for

539
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:45,040
example so yeah it's orange it seems

540
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,680
like your last validation step is to

541
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:52,810
compare to the current clock right yes

542
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:56,500
okay so if a significant number of

543
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:58,899
machines in a pool get a huge drift they

544
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:02,620
will all switch to panic mode as soon as

545
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:05,020
this will switch back on right you are

546
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,889
talking about the content EP or Collins

547
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,049
if you're saying that if all

548
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,260
yeah for example imagine a bunch of

549
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:15,179
machines that we you just remove from

550
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,460
the network from sometime and their

551
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:20,460
clocks drift yeah and then back you

552
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,850
connect them back to the Internet okay

553
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:28,200
so they all get to panic mode

554
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:35,939
yes you know draft I we are saying that

555
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:38,910
a start-up we and for now we use mode

556
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,120
but we are working on it and maybe we

557
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:47,490
can we don't have to really query all

558
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:50,820
the servers but only maybe a factor of

559
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:55,500
two of the service that we already query

560
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:57,928
in quantum maybe two M for example and

561
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,610
in order to get to two to the same

562
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:08,490
results so this is exactly what well

563
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:09,449
thank you thank you hello there I look

564
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,679
for the answer in your paper but

565
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,830
unfortunately the link at the end of

566
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,360
your presentation doesn't work so I I'm

567
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:25,530
gonna look for your paper somewhere else

568
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:27,178
but just like my question is is there a

569
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:30,840
general result here with regards to

570
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:34,049
security and the digestion of untrusted

571
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,139
sources that your based on yeah I think

572
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:42,330
that the bottom line is that we can use

573
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:45,210
a crowdsourcing in order to maybe use

574
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:49,678
and use for instance honest as a

575
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:53,280
watchdog to to NTP and see if there if

576
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:58,280
there is a huge shift then maybe we can

577
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:00,480
move to a more secure mechanism okay

578
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,160
there is a working link to the paper

579
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,160
from the ITF to oxide

580
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,779
[Music]

581
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,750
Alyce's on the current ntp client with

582
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:17,050
fixed so current ntp client has a fixed

583
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:19,510
number of servers right that it queries

584
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,930
it's a it has a fixed number of servers

585
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:25,510
so the fixed number of servers and using

586
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:28,120
your modified algorithm does it provide

587
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:31,930
the similar guarantees or is it similar

588
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,330
security guarantees if this client is

589
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:36,550
querying a fixed number of servers as

590
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:40,240
opposed to randomly selecting from a

591
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:43,899
large pool and using your modified

592
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,620
algorithm for selection does that give

593
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:50,680
the similar security guarantees or if I

594
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,810
fix the server's a in advance and then

595
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,770
just just drop deform each side this is

596
00:31:52,810 --> 00:32:01,330
- so the problem is that when what I do

597
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:04,389
that so once I have I have a malicious

598
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:07,540
sampling in my remaining set it will

599
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:11,230
continue to be in my in my remaining set

600
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:15,490
or it will be it will continue being in

601
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:17,710
I continue to ask the same server again

602
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,050
again again and if he is malicious

603
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:24,130
if he's if he's under the control of

604
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:27,370
malicious attacker then he can do the

605
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:33,430
repeated shift time I mean I I allow it

606
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:36,939
to do a limited time shift and the fact

607
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:39,400
that I I'm telling that with repeated

608
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:43,600
time shift is probability is negligible

609
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:45,730
is because I'm I'm querying different

610
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,350
servers all the time otherwise I won't

611
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,350
be able to say that

612
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:17,460
okay any more questions did you talk to

613
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:21,080
the NTP working group well yeah okay

614
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:27,210
glad to hear it okay thank you very much

615
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:27,210
[Applause]

616
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,069
[Music]

617
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:34,488
[Music]

618
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,730
can trembled either

619
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,540
I'm sorry guys

620
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:12,160
it really does yeah yeah this is

621
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:41,590
supposedly user friendly I worry about

622
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:42,399
that if I close to my prize maybe this

623
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:46,780
is gonna work

624
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:50,740
all right so the second talk is CJ Chung

625
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:53,830
from Rochester Institute of technical

626
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,220
immense thanks for the introduction

627
00:35:53,830 --> 00:36:01,420
Cowan hi my name is TJ from RIT

628
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:04,270
assistant professor first of all I'm

629
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,900
very excited to talk about research and

630
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:10,810
actually this is my first ITF and I'm

631
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:15,960
really excited to see how smart is to

632
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:20,460
people making a decision by humming so

633
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:23,110
so this talk is about DNS and DNS sack

634
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,390
so inevitably I need to give you some

635
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:27,910
introduction of how DNS and the NSA

636
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,319
works I'm little bit scared to talk

637
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,259
about the introduction with the address

638
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:36,040
in front of you I actually make a

639
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:39,550
standard internet but let me try my best

640
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,350
so DNS is like yellow pages in your

641
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,780
internet it translated human readable

642
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:47,259
name to mushroom readable name such as

643
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:50,440
IP address so I'm sorry the there should

644
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:54,970
be a animation but some yeah what's

645
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,500
missing so when you send the DNS request

646
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:58,600
from your host when you type a domain

647
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,430
name on your browser your browser is

648
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,400
configured to use your local reserved

649
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:05,379
verse and the DNS resolver will send the

650
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,170
DNS request to the author activity in

651
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,060
our servers and the server will return

652
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,100
the wrist response to the reserver and

653
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,890
forwarded back to the browser so that

654
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:17,040
you can see the content right but

655
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,040
unfortunately

656
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:23,190
unfortunately the sinking is not good

657
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,250
but a browser the DNS message is just

658
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,920
plain text so the bad guy in the middle

659
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:31,290
of the apes' can snatch the packet and

660
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,700
insert the wrong IP address to make you

661
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,150
see the different content such as

662
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:39,689
advertisement so to prove to prevent

663
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:42,960
from this attack DNS SEC was introduced

664
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:46,290
about 20 years ago the idea is very

665
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,020
simple let's deploy public and private

666
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:52,350
key infrastructure on a DNS site so

667
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:55,140
example.com now manages a key pair

668
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:57,690
private and public key pairs and when

669
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:01,950
the risk when the DNS Rica's calms it

670
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:04,860
responds with the signature so to verify

671
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:08,040
their signatures the reserver also need

672
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:12,780
to have a public key part so the public

673
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:15,529
key is in the DNS key record so here is

674
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,630
another problem how the reserver

675
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:23,160
guarantee that this public key actually

676
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:26,520
belongs to D example.com so DNS SEC

677
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:31,170
mirrors existing hierarchy of DNS so now

678
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,970
that comm John also have DNS key public

679
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,510
key and private key and use this key to

680
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:39,660
sign example that comes DNS key and of

681
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:43,080
course that comes owns a DNS key is also

682
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:47,399
signed by root DNS key then how does a

683
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:50,040
reserved verify the DNS root key it is

684
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,010
prefetch it so as you can tell there is

685
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,470
a chain of trust root signs calm that

686
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:59,160
comes on is example calm and example.com

687
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:03,270
signs at the end LTS a DNS record right

688
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,759
so let's see how this actual chain of

689
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:10,230
trust making a chain of trust process

690
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:14,510
works because the making a chain of

691
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:17,040
trust between root and calm and calm and

692
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:19,620
example that color basically saying so

693
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,020
let's focus on the later one so the key

694
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:25,319
concept is very simple so if you're the

695
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,509
owner of example calm and if you want to

696
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,140
make a chain of trust than one you need

697
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:33,289
to do is first generator the

698
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,509
Rickard so TS record is just a hash of

699
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:38,029
your dns key so it is basically long

700
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:40,849
string long hashida stream after that

701
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:43,930
you have to unload it to the your

702
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:47,750
parents so in this case Stockinger

703
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:50,410
then.com john will sign this dns key

704
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:54,019
record and i'm sorry for the animation

705
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:57,019
and also it generated a signature so

706
00:39:54,019 --> 00:40:01,578
when our reserves wants to verify if

707
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:08,089
this dns key is felid it has to fetch a

708
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:11,299
DES record from the parent john it's

709
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:13,339
challenging yes dynastic is challenging

710
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:17,109
right so it was introduced about 20

711
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:17,109
years ago but still not working right

712
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:33,910
alright so yeah alright here we go

713
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,020
[Laughter]

714
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:49,540
yeah so if we reserved a fetch is TS

715
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,850
record from the parent John and fetch a

716
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,250
TNF ski from the child's own if it is

717
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,799
same then it's done of course you need

718
00:40:54,250 --> 00:41:00,640
to verify the signature of the TS record

719
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,520
signed by the con john of course so if

720
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,589
you're the owner of a domain name if you

721
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,350
want to deploy the NSL you need to

722
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:12,070
follow these three steps first you need

723
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:14,440
to have a DNS key and using this key you

724
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,010
have to generate a signature at the last

725
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,950
step

726
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:20,340
you have to generate a DES record and

727
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:23,140
upload it to your parent

728
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,810
so the question and answer for this

729
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:28,660
research artist analyst this is how many

730
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:31,720
domains out there follow these steps so

731
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:33,819
to do that we used open Intel dataset

732
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,549
which collects all the domain names

733
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:41,470
under combat earth and that almost two

734
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:45,130
years so let's see actually there was a

735
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:49,839
black box to hide the graph to make you

736
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:52,780
CD to make a surprise but surprisingly

737
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:56,800
we found that only one percent of

738
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:59,160
domains deployed DNS key even though it

739
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,460
was introduced about twenty years ago so

740
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:08,859
but the good part is it's growing right

741
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:12,070
so ok then how about these signatures so

742
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:21,310
y-axis shows percent of domains missing

743
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:26,320
signature we can see it in the middle so

744
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:29,020
keep talking okay so yep so Y X is shows

745
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:34,060
percent of missing signatures so as you

746
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:36,400
can tell nearly 0.2% of domain names

747
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:39,009
with DNS key missed the signature so

748
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,170
signatures are rarely missing there is a

749
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:44,170
huge draw at this point this is due to

750
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,780
one registrar I don't want to call a

751
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,120
name but they used to have a DNS they

752
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,340
all day we kept with DNS key but some

753
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,799
reason they forgot to sign it

754
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,700
but after at that point they finally

755
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,309
signed

756
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,038
generator signatures so that is the

757
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:02,410
reason why there is a huge drop then how

758
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:05,380
about the finer one the last piece of

759
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:08,499
puzzle is you need to generate a TS

760
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:11,859
record and ignore it to the pension so

761
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:14,950
y-axis is percent of domains missing the

762
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:18,880
S record surprisingly we found that

763
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:21,819
nearly 30% of domains do not unload a TS

764
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,359
record so as you can tell there are two

765
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:29,099
problems here first one is why does the

766
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,589
make the NSF deployment remains so small

767
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:35,619
even though it was introduced about 20

768
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:38,710
years ago and the second problem is why

769
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:42,430
are 30 percent of domains still without

770
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:47,920
a TS record now why the screen is not

771
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:50,499
working so so there are two questions

772
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,200
main question for desktop the first one

773
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:55,868
is why is so hard to deploy the

774
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,509
intersect and D as you can tell from the

775
00:43:55,869 --> 00:44:01,230
title title of this talk how does a

776
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:07,119
register policy impact of the deployment

777
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:09,249
so let's first focus on the first one so

778
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,680
do you understand that you have to

779
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:13,660
understand how you can purchase your

780
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,808
domain name and how to deploy the

781
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,489
innocent so let's say if you want to buy

782
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:20,410
a domain name you typically go to a

783
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:23,079
register for example code daddy

784
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,970
so registrar is organization tests Elsa

785
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,420
- main name to the public and also it

786
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:30,609
has a access to the database managed by

787
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,319
registry so registry is a basically

788
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:33,339
top-level domain name John for

789
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,808
example.com

790
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:40,150
is managed by Verisign and after that

791
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:43,539
after purchasing a domain name you also

792
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:46,239
need to have a name servers the first

793
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:48,880
choice you can make is you can just use

794
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:52,299
a name server provided by the registrar

795
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:56,619
so in this case if you want to deploy a

796
00:44:52,299 --> 00:45:00,339
DNS set then GoDaddy will generate a DNS

797
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:02,920
key signatures and also TS record right

798
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:05,319
and also it has an access to the

799
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,900
database managed by registry so it can

800
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:10,990
simply easily unload a TS record

801
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,910
to D registry right the second choice is

802
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:17,618
you can run your own name solver you

803
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:20,109
bought a host and after that install a

804
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:23,349
bind or the NSX software generators

805
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:26,348
signatures as well as TS record but here

806
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:30,940
you do not have any any access to the

807
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:34,779
registry so what you need to do is to

808
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:37,539
generate a DAR and give it to the

809
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:41,220
Registrar and ask them to unload it to

810
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:47,829
the registry let's say you're using

811
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:49,990
third-party DNS operator third party

812
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:52,329
Nassau operator so in this case for

813
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,839
example Claude Fleur will manage all the

814
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:58,599
DNS records for you including scenario

815
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:00,430
signatures TS record but again third

816
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,490
party DNS operator doesn't have any

817
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:06,098
access to the registry so you need to

818
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:08,229
copy the string des record which is

819
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:11,710
basically a long string copied and

820
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:15,190
pasted pass it to the registrar and ask

821
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:18,279
them to am loaded to the registry if you

822
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:21,279
think this process is complex actually I

823
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:23,440
can make it even worse so for example

824
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:26,680
let's say you bought a domain name from

825
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,210
a reseller reseller is organization that

826
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,279
sells a domain name to the public but it

827
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,799
doesn't have any of 32 Connect contact

828
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:36,250
to the registry so what they do is to

829
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:38,170
partner with a registrar so if you

830
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,200
purchase a domain name from a reseller

831
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,779
and using a third party knows operator

832
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,538
then you need to copy a TS record and

833
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:48,720
pass it to the reseller and ask them to

834
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:51,789
upload it to the registrar and registry

835
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:57,459
such a simple process what could

836
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:59,940
possibly go wrong so as you can tell the

837
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:03,849
key part of the point in a sec is

838
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:06,220
registrar so what I'm going to do is I'm

839
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:08,980
going to show you is we showing the

840
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,959
research that we surveyed by surveying

841
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:15,220
popular register with the loss of domain

842
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,380
name so what we do is we first purchase

843
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:20,288
a domain name from a registrar and we

844
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,590
see if they simply support the NSA under

845
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:23,710
name

846
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:25,720
servers after that we disable it we run

847
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,900
our own name servers generate ideas

848
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:31,810
record and ask them if you guys can

849
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:34,570
unload a TS record to the registry if

850
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:35,440
they do we deliberately give them an

851
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,570
incorrect

852
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,870
TS record which is not matched with the

853
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:43,120
NS key the reason is that because if the

854
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:45,730
Registrar does not check the validity of

855
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,520
the DNS key and the TS record and simply

856
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:50,980
unload it to the registry then your

857
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:54,100
domain name will be instantly in

858
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:56,950
accessible to the reserver that support

859
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:01,029
DNR set such as Google reserver or call

860
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:03,460
or cloud ler resort so before showing

861
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,980
this before showing the all the details

862
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,260
of the analysis I'm going to give you

863
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:11,020
some anecdotal examples that we

864
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,570
experienced your during our experiment

865
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,670
the first one is we started the NS key

866
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:19,150
deployment are deployed for one rail you

867
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:21,640
start but not the s record so ask why

868
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,750
you guys do not know that es record the

869
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,290
first response was that

870
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:28,450
oh they remove the DNS in mania and the

871
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,940
other another register responded back to

872
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:33,759
me saying that hey most people do not

873
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:37,870
understand DNA so imagine their white

874
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:41,230
faces when I mentioning DNS SEC so yeah

875
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:43,540
this is what happened and also we asked

876
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:46,390
a register to unload a TS record by

877
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:48,970
email from the different email address

878
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:53,379
than the one we use to register it was

879
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:55,299
installed successfully and also we asked

880
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:59,260
a registered to him that IDs record to

881
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:03,000
our web our domain name domain dia web

882
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:06,040
live chat it was installed successfully

883
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,500
to someone else domain name due to a

884
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,870
mistake by customer agent yeah usually

885
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,330
the customer Asian you know opens a

886
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:16,029
multiple pet to deal with multiple

887
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:17,740
customers so just made a mistake to pass

888
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,900
a TS record to the other domain name so

889
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,959
this is the detail hey I'd like to

890
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:27,370
update my TS record it's awesome one

891
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:30,520
moment so I now update your DNS IDs

892
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:34,080
record to panama music the comp right

893
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,890
I'm sorry but my domain is Hg

894
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,690
come oh I apologize you're silly me yeah

895
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:44,819
now you're right silly me so one moment

896
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:47,460
so after I've the risk Cathy's response

897
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,470
I try to connect the panel music comm

898
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:53,540
using my you know using Google reservas

899
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:57,240
but the response was sir failure yep

900
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:59,340
so this is the research survey research

901
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,359
that we surveyed about a20 registrar

902
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:06,530
details about 50% on nearly 50% of all

903
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:11,040
domain names of the combat art and that

904
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:14,900
suddenly only four registers support DNS

905
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,180
SEC under name servers which is not good

906
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,800
for your information we read on actually

907
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,410
this study was done about twenty seven

908
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:27,440
twenty seventy but for this talk we just

909
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:32,819
redid all the survey a few weeks ago and

910
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:35,010
after that we disable our we run our own

911
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:37,290
name servers and disable Det full names

912
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,820
that were provided by register and we

913
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:42,150
asked them to know that es record

914
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:44,850
interestingly 15 out of 20 was first

915
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:47,310
support latias record on node so mainly

916
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:49,440
there are two functions functionalities

917
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:52,200
the first one is for example web

918
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,330
supporting ticket or web live chat so

919
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,330
using this methodology today all those

920
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:59,850
terminologies record or some registrar's

921
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:01,350
ask us to send the email with the you

922
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:06,450
know content is of course the long

923
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:10,080
string of a TS record and sadly only 5

924
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:14,399
out of 20 check the verification so yeah

925
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,930
if you happen to deliver incorrect yes

926
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,120
record your domain name will be

927
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:21,000
instantly inaccessible to DT and as a

928
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:27,120
supporting reservist so here's the

929
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:29,400
summary only 4 out of 20 support a 4 out

930
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,680
of 20 registrar support DNS SEC on their

931
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,800
name servers what this means to you is

932
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,690
if you don't want to run your own name

933
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,960
server most of the time you cannot

934
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:43,380
deploy the NSA if you want to run your

935
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,710
own name servers still you cannot deploy

936
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,610
it in a sec for 5 out of 20 and only 5

937
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,500
registers

938
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,240
four check the various record

939
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,250
verification which means if you happen

940
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,470
to I'm gonna incorrect yes record not

941
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:58,740
you to copy and paste theater then your

942
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:01,980
domain name will be inaccessible right

943
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:04,470
then the next question is why are this

944
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,110
DNS the support of registrar's so rare

945
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:09,390
what why is that actually we already

946
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:12,090
know the answer because the anisette

947
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:14,700
introduced much more records right it

948
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:17,700
because basically in this signature for

949
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,919
every DNS records and also signatures

950
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:23,549
are usually three to six times larger

951
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,380
than Nam DNS records and also the NS key

952
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:28,560
is like your password you have to choose

953
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:31,590
strong key and also unique key and also

954
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:35,490
you have to roll over the key regularly

955
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:38,490
in a regular basis actually you already

956
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:42,870
seen why how this policy impact on DNS

957
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:45,390
SEC deployment for example we saw that

958
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:48,089
four out of 20 registered support DNS

959
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:51,930
SEC on their name servers but

960
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:54,990
interestingly 15 out of 20 along all

961
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:57,720
those two I'm not a TS record right the

962
00:52:54,990 --> 00:53:00,600
thing is in the first case when the

963
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,910
registrar's run DTN our names over with

964
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,940
DNS SEC they need to manage all DNS

965
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:10,350
records right in their name servers but

966
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:12,690
the if the owner wants to run their own

967
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:15,450
name servers than what the registrar

968
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:17,220
needs to do is to simply receive a TS

969
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,779
record and unload it to the registry

970
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,910
done they don't need to manage all the

971
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:26,690
ti records at all so so let's compare

972
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:31,740
the 2017 wizard

973
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:33,420
so our study was done in 2017 March so

974
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,819
at the time only three out of 20

975
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,890
registers supported DTN our secondary

976
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,590
name servers at the register side name

977
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:42,810
servers and 11 out of 20 supporting it

978
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:45,750
when the users want to use their own

979
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:48,960
name servers and 2 out of them check the

980
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:52,680
verification so as you can tell it has

981
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,970
been improved but yep it has been proven

982
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,350
it's much better than you know

983
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:59,879
decreasing you know something like the

984
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:00,650
better still way to go so let's now

985
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,770
let's

986
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:06,560
severe to how the register how does a

987
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:08,960
registered policy impact the deployment

988
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:14,150
to see that we also use the historical

989
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:16,700
data set so to see that we first focused

990
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:18,560
on the comm that worked on that data set

991
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,859
but as you already seen the deployment

992
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:25,549
ratio is a very small less than 1% but

993
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:28,430
we happen to know that that NL that I

994
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:30,890
see this to cctlds the NSA deployment

995
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:33,529
ratio is nearly 50 percent which is

996
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:37,190
really good and also we updated our

997
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:41,300
dataset by considering the most recent

998
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:44,240
data set 2019 actually the the

999
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:46,970
percentage key field is a hidden due to

1000
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:52,459
the menu me animation fault but it was

1001
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:59,750
increased by 0.1 percent yeah but still

1002
00:54:52,460 --> 00:55:01,580
increased so so let's see how the how a

1003
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:03,500
registered policy impact on the NSA

1004
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,350
deployment in other words how can we

1005
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:09,980
encourage a registrar to support the NSA

1006
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:12,560
the first perspective is registry so we

1007
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,770
happen to notice that the KP entities

1008
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:18,320
for a loop is where this register gained

1009
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:20,690
a financial incentive from the registry

1010
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:23,630
registry when they activate the inner

1011
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:26,900
sac for the domain name state manager so

1012
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:29,120
as you can tell that NL that has it is -

1013
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:32,260
domain names the NF set deployment ratio

1014
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:37,640
is nearly 90 percent which is awesome

1015
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:40,640
but how about the other three domain

1016
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,410
names dollar than other word net comm

1017
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,650
where they cannot get any financial

1018
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:49,390
incentive so as you can tell actually I

1019
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:52,970
already draw the figure outline here

1020
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:55,310
it's nearly zero percent so which means

1021
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:57,379
financial gain is a huge incentive for

1022
00:55:55,310 --> 00:56:00,140
the point in a sec they only deployed in

1023
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:03,590
a sec when they can get a financial

1024
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:07,549
incentive the second perspective is

1025
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:11,030
registered so we found that OVH and

1026
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:13,550
GoDaddy two registers supporting DNA

1027
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,570
secondary for name servers but Oh

1028
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:17,420
bah-bah

1029
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:20,720
for free but GoDaddy you have to obtain

1030
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:25,400
by paying $35 per year to activate the

1031
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:28,279
NSA as you can as you can expect the OVH

1032
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:32,990
DNS circuit paloma ratio is over 20% but

1033
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:35,350
GoDaddy is nearly 3 percent so free dns

1034
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:37,790
level of course support encourage

1035
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:42,940
encourages user to deploy it in a sec

1036
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:46,070
and the third perspective is reseller

1037
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:48,680
co1 unregistered call antagonist is a

1038
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:50,540
registrar for NL domain name but there

1039
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,210
are reseller further com that are the

1040
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:55,610
net so the top graph shows the number of

1041
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,650
domains they manage and the bottom graph

1042
00:56:55,610 --> 00:57:00,650
shows the percent of domains with the

1043
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:04,160
TNF ski and the TS record so as you can

1044
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:07,280
tell from the white line that the NS a

1045
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:10,220
polymer Asia for NL is nearly 100% which

1046
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,920
is good but interestingly we observe

1047
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:17,060
that there is a gradual deployment

1048
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:20,030
increasing ratio for the other domain

1049
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:23,240
names the reason is that this register

1050
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:28,270
dis antagonist actually started to

1051
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:31,009
deploy the NF sack at the end of 20 2014

1052
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:34,880
but what that what happened was they

1053
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:37,670
switch it a register the supporting at

1054
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,440
the NS set but the migration only

1055
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:43,400
happens when the current domain name

1056
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,100
expires so they after the previous

1057
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,190
domain name expires they migrate to a

1058
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:51,650
new registrar the supports DNS SEC so

1059
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:54,860
that is the reason why you can see kind

1060
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,680
of gradual deployment so complex

1061
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:59,600
relationship between reseller registrar

1062
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,470
also reserved in a kind of slow

1063
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,299
deployment of the NSA and the other

1064
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:07,759
perspective is third party Dennis

1065
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:10,760
operator so for your recall if we are

1066
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,160
using a third party DNS operator if you

1067
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,740
want to use the intersect then you have

1068
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:18,440
to copy a TS record from a third party

1069
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:22,939
operator and a pass it to your registrar

1070
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:25,010
and ask them to UM not e2d registry so

1071
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:28,100
cloth layer actually announced the

1072
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:31,430
universal DNS SEC and 2016 only to

1073
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:34,370
sixteen so user if you want to use cloth

1074
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:36,680
layers dnsa you have to opt in and cloth

1075
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:40,490
layer Deanna solver will generate all

1076
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:43,730
TNS key signature as well as TS record

1077
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:46,100
so when you need to do is copy a dis

1078
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:48,830
tiene a TS record and pass it to the

1079
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:53,270
Registrar to ask them to load it to the

1080
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:55,850
registry but the top graph shows percent

1081
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:58,070
of TNF ski with TS record but

1082
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:59,470
interestingly even though the TNF ski

1083
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:03,440
deployment in the bottom graph

1084
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:06,589
increasing right but still 50 percent of

1085
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:09,410
domain names with TNF ski still failing

1086
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:11,960
to deploy this record this could be

1087
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:14,359
either one the administrators did not

1088
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:17,270
understand correctly what how to deploy

1089
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:20,330
it in a set correctly or their register

1090
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:24,200
does not simply although the users to

1091
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:28,069
another TS record so the point the NSTIC

1092
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:31,490
is even harder for users using third

1093
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:34,790
party antennas operator so here's a

1094
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:37,609
conclusion so registrar's play a

1095
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:40,430
critical role in supporting TNS set

1096
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:43,100
today only four out of actually it's for

1097
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:45,410
a 4 out of 20 register support DN f

1098
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,930
cylinder authoritative name servers or

1099
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:50,629
interestingly a 15 out of 20 support on

1100
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:53,270
loading OTS a custom yes record so

1101
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:55,670
comparing to the Reaser of 2017 it has

1102
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:58,940
been improved but it requires much more

1103
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:01,400
effort so the NSF deployment depends on

1104
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:04,520
many policies register is supported for

1105
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:07,070
free registry it would be great if it

1106
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,259
they can of for financial incentive and

1107
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:12,650
reseller be over to choose a partner

1108
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,310
register and also when you're using

1109
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,070
third party

1110
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:18,890
I guess the CDC DNS key new protocol

1111
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:21,050
which all users to another TS record

1112
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,430
directly to the registry and we have any

1113
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:27,350
support from the registrar

1114
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:29,120
we this will be very good solution I

1115
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:32,720
guess so

1116
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,990
that's it and uh I thanks for your

1117
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,259
attention and I'm

1118
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:45,060
happy to take any questions okay thank

1119
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:47,190
you all right that was an excellent talk

1120
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,869
it's very difficult circumstances with

1121
01:00:47,190 --> 01:01:01,050
the projector does anyone have any

1122
01:00:48,869 --> 01:01:04,830
questions was hurt occur is I a great

1123
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:07,680
talk entertaining to and I don't mean

1124
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:10,230
because of the projector blinking are

1125
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,509
you doing are you continuing to do long

1126
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:17,160
running statistics gather gathering and

1127
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:18,420
are you publishing it live at all and

1128
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,580
then I might offer to collaborate a

1129
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,820
little bit so I actually have a webpage

1130
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:27,119
called stats DNS SEC - tools or where we

1131
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:28,740
in Victor - company publish continually

1132
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,480
daily updating stats of DNS SEC

1133
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,520
deployment and deign deployment in

1134
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,590
particular and it would be really cool

1135
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,030
to merge those because I think yeah

1136
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,140
Victor has a lot of data that you

1137
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,520
probably don't have and you have a lot

1138
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,670
of data that I think Victor doesn't have

1139
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,920
so we should talk yep sure absolutely

1140
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:54,000
but are you running it continually or

1141
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:59,040
you yep okay awesome nice talk this is

1142
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:02,220
Pallavi iris from Salesforce so one of

1143
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:05,490
the angle to this whole research could

1144
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:10,020
be and I'm speaking from experience is

1145
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:12,899
that when the client is big like if your

1146
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:15,630
domain name is used by a lot of

1147
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:19,650
customers you try to make the domain

1148
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:23,550
name multi vendor so you might have your

1149
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:27,330
zone hosted on maybe CloudFlare and one

1150
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:30,720
more provider so your zone might be

1151
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:32,880
xyz.com or whatever might be multi

1152
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,730
vendor where it's hosted on provider one

1153
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:40,080
and provider two in that case again

1154
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:41,260
achieving DNS SEC is hard because just

1155
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,770
matching the key

1156
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:47,619
and yes record so that's another angle

1157
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:49,300
that you can look at of the zones that

1158
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:52,960
you are scanning if they are

1159
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:56,320
multi-vendor in that case also they may

1160
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,950
not be it's not easy to do DNS signing

1161
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:02,800
and all that so we actually have a draft

1162
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:04,509
in DNA swabs related to this but we'll

1163
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,010
be happy to talk to you about it yeah

1164
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:10,200
actually I'm not familiar with that area

1165
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:13,330
but I'm happy to take a look yeah thanks

1166
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:17,500
all right polar bears from NuStar yep

1167
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:20,319
nice presentation you might also on

1168
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:22,960
those some 30% that don't have D s

1169
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,430
records one of the very common things

1170
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,410
that happens is people start playing

1171
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,549
with DNS SEC and the first thing they do

1172
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:29,080
when they aren't sure is they'll yank

1173
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:32,380
the D s records from the parent because

1174
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:35,619
then you simply go undetermined as

1175
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:37,330
opposed to going invalid so you may want

1176
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:39,250
to start going back and resampling on a

1177
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:41,440
recurring basis of who may have D s

1178
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:43,359
records appearing and disappearing yep

1179
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,250
it's also one of the vectors that people

1180
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,390
are using with hijacking is that the

1181
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,760
first thing they will do is they will

1182
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:50,140
change and remove the D s records and

1183
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,500
change the image and the parent and

1184
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:57,190
start playing games

1185
01:03:52,500 --> 01:04:00,040
thanks can I respond to that as well

1186
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:03,490
so I was one of the co-authors of his

1187
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,810
paper we looked at that and it's not

1188
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:07,689
people playing around with Deena sake

1189
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:10,330
it's people simply not deploying

1190
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:11,830
deploying it yes in one TLD they sign

1191
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:14,140
everything they own they sign their

1192
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:16,119
whole portfolio but then they only

1193
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:18,160
deploy the s and the T all these that

1194
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:22,300
give them a financial incentives such as

1195
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,830
Tata Nintendo to see there are some

1196
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,800
positive side effects because there are

1197
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:28,750
people that sign everything because of

1198
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:32,320
the financial incentive but I also

1199
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:36,460
deployed yes in every TLD which is what

1200
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:37,780
people should have been doing and there

1201
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,670
are some positive side effects from

1202
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,170
other incentives that Tod vision are

1203
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:45,340
deploying for example for the deployment

1204
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:48,730
of Dane TLS a records where you see as a

1205
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:50,850
side effect also an uptake of of the NS

1206
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:53,010
a gain in other Tod stand

1207
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,779
ones that deployed the incentives so I'd

1208
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:57,750
like to applaud Ulrich who is over there

1209
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:06,210
for the CC for deploying that incentive

1210
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:08,850
as well thanks Roland hi I'm rich from

1211
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:12,240
the swedish internet foundation we do

1212
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:15,210
runs si so I just want to say yeah very

1213
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:18,930
nice work the only critic I have is that

1214
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:21,120
you didn't test our registrar's you

1215
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:22,259
didn't test our registrar's we would

1216
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,170
like to have this test on our

1217
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:26,790
registrar's because it's we want to

1218
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:28,710
promote the NS second

1219
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:31,940
so very good work and we've been looking

1220
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,940
to them thank you thanks so much

1221
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:39,570
Rikuo hum Verisign I'm just one question

1222
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:42,840
in the chart 24 one good presentation

1223
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:46,290
certainly appreciated on chart 24 this

1224
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:49,620
is where sort of the 15 out of let me

1225
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:52,529
see 24 different chart 24 this is where

1226
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:55,980
the chart where the 15 out of 20 20

1227
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:58,050
comes up and I'm curious as to why the

1228
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,840
the ones that provide the upload by

1229
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:03,420
email yeah this one here why they

1230
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:06,300
weren't counted as being supportive of

1231
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:08,310
DNS SEC even though they don't appear to

1232
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:11,640
do it based on when the research was

1233
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:13,680
done through their web portal they those

1234
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,560
registrar's you indicate here do support

1235
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,379
you I'm sorry can you repeat I'm sorry

1236
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,840
okay so on this chart this is where the

1237
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:23,670
number 15 out of 20 comes from yet ones

1238
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:26,010
that support then I am curious as to why

1239
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:28,920
the ones in the lower right corner

1240
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:33,530
those those there weren't included in

1241
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,530
that in the count is supporting DNS SEC

1242
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,010
okay okay my bit

1243
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:46,980
so the the other five but you don't name

1244
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:49,530
the other five registrar's they don't do

1245
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:53,280
anything and then the only other thing I

1246
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:55,200
would offer is that in the in the at

1247
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,680
least in the calm registry there's a

1248
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:01,589
very large number as recognized lots of

1249
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,190
registrar's participate and with varying

1250
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:05,530
levels of participation

1251
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:09,540
for both allowing DNS SEC through their

1252
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:09,540
portal and also with the other names yep

1253
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:23,340
okay any Mambo Jodi Colker from GoDaddy

1254
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,900
I'm just curious do you have any data on

1255
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:30,010
maybe the top hundred thousand Alexa

1256
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:33,070
websites that are using DNS SEC yes we

1257
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:35,020
do but not for this paper actually we

1258
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:37,960
probably should the one on another paper

1259
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:39,670
at the usual security 2017 there is a

1260
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:43,080
research for the Aleks of a million

1261
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:46,210
website if they saw the ratio of these

1262
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:48,310
domain names supporting the NSA but it's

1263
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:50,530
very low it's less than two percent I

1264
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:52,960
guess so why do you think that some of

1265
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:55,210
the largest retailers don't use DNS SEC

1266
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,690
they are the most vulnerable for this

1267
01:07:55,210 --> 01:08:01,930
aren't they I'm sorry can you repeat it

1268
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:06,040
sure why do the largest retailers on the

1269
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:08,620
largest retailers retailers business

1270
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:13,180
registry know the peoples that may get

1271
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:16,210
money off the internet like Amazon why

1272
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,800
do they not use DNS SEC if anyone's from

1273
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:26,340
Amazon is here I'd love to hear the

1274
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:26,340
answer google you fire to your Sergey

1275
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:35,440
I'm sorry I I have no idea they should

1276
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:39,250
supporting it but uh well I think what

1277
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:41,740
the issue is here is that as many

1278
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:43,830
domains that you're looking at most of

1279
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:46,420
them are for small to medium businesses

1280
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:50,410
small to medium businesses don't have an

1281
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:53,680
IT department mm-hmm they also probably

1282
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:56,170
don't really understand DNS so adding

1283
01:08:53,680 --> 01:09:03,430
DNS SEC on top of that doesn't make that

1284
01:08:56,170 --> 01:09:06,279
any better for them yes but first small

1285
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,800
companies and the we found many times

1286
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:10,479
these are anecdotal examples we

1287
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,370
sometimes out observe these small

1288
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,589
companies just relying on the default

1289
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:16,299
names over it manages by register so

1290
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:18,640
that is why we're in

1291
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:20,769
registers to support the NSA on their

1292
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,900
default name solvers if that's the case

1293
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:24,940
then they don't the small companies to

1294
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:27,160
do not need to care about the intersect

1295
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:37,139
because they will automatically turn the

1296
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:37,139
DNS SEC sure okay well thank you again

1297
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:40,329
[Applause]

1298
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:45,220
okay so that's everything for this

1299
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,600
meeting thank you again to both the

1300
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:49,480
speakers I think that was two really

1301
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:52,299
excellent talks I think both TJ and

1302
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:54,068
Mehta will be around for at least

1303
01:09:52,299 --> 01:09:55,810
tomorrow I think possibly most of the

1304
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:58,060
week so if you're interested in the work

1305
01:09:55,810 --> 01:10:06,610
please grab them in the hallways and

1306
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:09,900
thank you for your attention if you can

1307
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:09,900
pass the blue sheets to the front

1308
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,820
you
